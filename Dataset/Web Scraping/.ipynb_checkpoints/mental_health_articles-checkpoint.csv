In this blog we are going to discuss the issue of digital exclusion in older people and set out what we are doing about it. Digital exclusionis where a section of the population doesn’t have access to the use of digital communications to help them fully participate in society. One of the feelings millions of us experienced during the coronavirus pandemic was loneliness. In our combined efforts to stay safe and save lives, our usual ways of seeing family, friends or just familiar faces were put on pause. Many of us turned to digital means of communication to connect with the people in our lives. Whether that was arranging a virtual movie night with a friend, a quiz night with family or simply a phone call with a work colleague. However, the pandemic showed us that access to these digital forms of communication isn’t available or accessible to everyone. The issue of digital exclusion in later life has become starkly apparent: research by the Centre for Aging Better emphasised the significant digital divide among 50–70-year-olds and how this has worsened because of Covid. To illustrate how digital access declines in older demographics, the report highlights ONS (The Office of National Statistics) figures which show the state of digital exclusion in the UK: There are many reasons why older people can be digitally excluded. The inequalities in our society mean that those with the most wealth have far more economic resources, social support and knowledge to be digitally included. For a variety of reasons, later life housing schemes also struggle to provide Wi-Fi. The pandemic has taught us that digital access is essential, not an optional extra. Digital inclusion is about working with communities to address issues of opportunity, access, knowledge and skill in relation to using technology and, in particular, the internet.1 Digital inclusion is more than just being able to get online; it’s also about having the confidence to learn new digital skills. When we have the confidence to connect with others, or access services through the digital world, this can benefit our mental health. Digital access could include accessing GP surgeries or streaming services to watch your favourite shows. Much as we shy away from it, we are an aging society. There is a growing need for more projects which offer well-resourced digital inclusion packages, with tailor-made training and support. By 2050 it is projected that one in four people will be aged 65 and over. In 2019 it was approximately one in five. We see digital inclusion as priority for older people. We also need streaming services to make more programmes which challenge stereotypical views of ageing. At the heart of thePicture This projectare 12 weekly virtual creative sessions. We know that sometimes expressing emotions creatively is easier than using words. In the virtual creative sessions, art facilitators bring different themes to the weeks and talk about the work of a diverse range of artists. People taking part receive a bag full of high-quality art materials. The group then visually explore issues around identity, passions and how they are managing emerging from the pandemic. Whilst the course focuses on creative art and drawing, the groups also learn basic IT skills. These skills range from how to send an e-mail, how to connect with family and friends remotely and attend events to how to use Facebook and other social media channels, and how to order shopping online. It has been life-changing for some: “I spoke with family on the device, and it was as though they were in the room; it was incredible. I have also joined Facebook and connected with people who I haven’t seen in over 40 years.” – Edward (65) “My daughter lives in Ghana and we have connected online. She is telling her neighbours she can’t believe her mother is now online and learning at the age of 90.” – Phyllis (90) The Picture This project is both improving people’s mental health by increasing their social connections and by building their skills and confidence so that they can get satisfaction from the digital world.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/focus-mental-health-minority-men,A focus on the mental health of minority men,"This content mentions suicide or suicidal thoughts and discusses discrimination or discriminatory violence (such as homophobia, racism, sexism and ableism). Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. It’s not long since we spent the month of November putting particular emphasis on men’s mental health. There’s a good reason for doing so. Some statistics about men’s mental health in the UK are really worrying. For example,men are under-representedwithin primary mental health services in England, such as Increasing Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) but are over-represented within acute psychiatric services. In recent years, men have also accounted for 75% ofcompleted suicides, which is currently the biggest cause of death for men under 50. But it’s important not to treat men as a monolithic group because we will have different experiences of the world based on – among other things - our ethnicity, national origin, sexuality and class. And at the Mental Health Foundation, we look at inequalities because often, those variables put us at different risks for developing poor mental health. For example, Black men in the UK aremore likely to experience psychosisthan their white peers and more likely to be detained under the Mental Health Act. Suicide rates among men of Black African and Black Caribbean origin are also higher. Gay, bisexual and trans men are also at greater risk of poor mental health. And there is some speculation that having had their sexuality or gender identity pathologized for years, there is mistrust of health professionals that can result in reduced help-seeking. Finally, Irish men in the UK are another group who have experienced higher rates of poor mental health. Irish People in the UK have hadhigher rates of hospital admissionfor poor mental health and a greater risk of suicide. A number of factors contribute to someone’s risk of having poor mental health or attempting suicide, includingpoverty. For men in the UK, it’s thought that some of it might also be down to the stories that our culture perpetuates aboutwhat it looks like to be a successful man. The imperative to be strong and self-reliant can impact our ability to connect and build relatedness. This can result in us feeling lonely and isolated, which in turn can impact our mental health. If you layer theexperience of discriminationon top of this, that may account for some of the increased risk minority men appear to face. And whilst many men, regardless of background, feel pressure to conform to masculine ideals, perhaps minority men feel particular pressure to appear strong relative to the majority. For men in general, it is important to create opportunities to connect and feel seen and heard. There is good work being done to achieve this. One example isAndy’s Man Club, which meets in locations around England to give men a space to talk, aiming to halvethe male suicide rate. Sometimes it helps to be with peers to discuss common difficulties. It can be important to have spaces that permit reflection on different aspects of our identity and some of the associated challenges. And those challenges might relate to being a man, being a gay man, or being a man and also an ethnic minority. At the Mental Health Foundation, we are currently delivering theComhar projectin partnership withicapand theLondon Irish Centre. Building on our decade of experience in peer support, the project offers weekly groups for Irish men in mid and later life. It represents an approach that has worked in various settings to foster community and break isolation. In delivering the project, our aim is to do just that, but also shore up a model that can generally serve the mental health of men, including minority men.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/mental-health-research-whats-it-us,Mental health research - what's in it for us?,"This year marks70 yearssince the creation of the Mental Health Foundation. When the Foundation was initially started, it was known as the Mental Health Research Fund, and though it has changed in many ways over the years, mental health research is still at the core of what we do today. In particular, we focus on research related toprevention and mental health. This means exploring how mental health problems can be stopped before they occur and how we can support everyone with and without a mental health problem to stay well. There is a vast amount of mental health research, and it can be difficult to make sense of it all. How do we take stock of what we know and what we still need to discover? This is where theCochrane Common Mental Disorders teamcome in. The Cochrane team are key experts in “systematic reviews”, which is a way of comprehensively bringing together all the existing research on a topic and pooling the findings to understand better what the research tells us, how strong the evidence is, and where further exploration is needed. This type of work is important for truly understanding what the research means and whether we should apply it to practice, to policy, and to our own lives. The Mental Health Foundation has launched a new partnership between ourselves and Cochrane Common Mental Disorders, pulling on the strengths of both organisations to start a new programme of work that will focus on understanding what the research tells us in the areas of: mental health prevention, children and young people’s mental health, and the connection between mental health and physical health. However, the most important part of this new partnership isn’t either of us, it’syou. We strongly believe that for research to be meaningful, it needs to answer the questions that are most important to everyone, and it needs to do so in a way that has a real impact on people’s lives – their workplaces, their families and their communities. Mental health research - What’s In it for us? We will be looking to answer these questions over the coming weeks and months. Watch this space for further opportunities to get involved. We are excited to share this new step forward with you all. Help us answer the most pressing questions of our time to prevent mental health problems and help people lead mentally healthier lives.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/nhs-long-term-plan-progress-and-way-forward,The NHS Long Term Plan: progress and a way forward,"NHS England has published the newNHS Long Term Plan, setting out a vision for the future of the NHS in England – including healthcare provision and outcomes to be achieved. As advertised, the plan includes, for the first time, new commitments to prevention and mental health and is also the first plan that goes well beyond the current political terms, indicating a shift towards more strategic, visionary and investment-based thinking. Understanding the future of mental health care as defined by the Plan requires understanding how the changes in the healthcare system will more generally affect mental health. And there are three important reasons to be optimistic: The NHS has committed to growing mental health spending as a proportion of the overall spending on the service, creating a new ringfenced local investment fund worth at least £2.3 billion a year by 2023/24. We welcome not just the much-needed increase in funding but also the ringfencing. This acknowledges the historical underinvestment in mental health – which the Foundation has pushed to change on several occasions. It also takes a step in the right direction to make mental health the strategic priority it should be, especially in the areas facing the deepest inequalities. The plan commits the NHS to continue targeting a higher share of funding towards areas with high health inequalities than would have been allocated using the previous system of the ‘core needs formula’. From April 2019, NHS England will introduce a more accurate assessment of the need for community health and mental health services. It will ensure that allocations formulae are more responsive to the greatest health inequalities and unmet needs. To ensure local programmes are focused on reducing health inequalities, the NHS will set out specific, measurable goals for narrowing inequalities, including those relating to poverty, perhaps the strongest determinant of poor mental health. In 2019, all local health systems will be expected to set out what specific action they will take to reduce health inequalities by 2023/24 and 2028/29. In collaboration with Public Health England and voluntary and community sector partners, NHS England intends to develop and publish a menu of evidence-based interventions for use at a local level to contribute towards the goal of reducing health inequalities, including for groups that the Foundation has worked with in co-production, such as people with learning disabilities, older people, and carers of people experiencing health problems. To get funding, local areas will be crucial to show they are appropriately focusing on those with the greatest need. It is pleasing to see that access to funding is attached to ensuring that health inequalities are addressed as mental health problems are not evenly distributed across society. Generally, people living with mental health problems encounter poorer health outcomes more widely. On several occasions, the Foundation has strongly advocated for appropriate local action based on evidence. The plan brings a renewed focus on prevention – the strongest advocacy point we have pursued in the Foundation. There is a welcome emphasis on: These points can certainly do much to ensure our next generation will have better mental health outcomes. Diversifying the support available to people of all ages and enabling digital care can add to this optimism. The Long Term Plan brings some further positive priorities to transform the NHS's digital elements, including online access to records and using tools and interventions to support better care. It’s great that the changes will empower clinicians and people who use services while ensuring personal data protection. However, it’s not only the online aspect of the services but also the non-clinical elements that can bring much desired additional support. We often call this “social prescribing"", which provides more personalised therapeutic options outside clinical settings, such as exercise or art interventions. Encouragingly, the NHS will roll out the NHS Personalised Care model across the country, reaching 2.5 million people by 2023/24 and then aiming to double that again within a decade. As part of this work, link workers within primary care networks will work with people to develop tailored plans and connect them to local groups and support services. It is important to welcome the plans to improve health and mental health through action across different sectors. Integrated approaches within clinical and community settings are vital. We are pleased to have contributed to helping in making the plan more ambitious in going beyond the needs of the traditional clinical services and into public health approaches. We will have to see – and provide consultation to – the forthcoming Social Care green paper to understand how some of the elements of holistic care will be followed and also continue lobbying for increased local public health funding, which is critical in achieving the mission of prevention. Of course, our work does not end here. The Plan will now move into the arduous process of implementation, which has historically been hindered in England by complexity at a local level, systems that have lacked integration and persistent inequalities impacted by social structures and austerity. It is promising that several of the pledges cover an integrated care system for the country and are going beyond the current political cycle and over the next decade, but tracking progress and assessing impact won’t be straightforward. The investment has increased, but the resources are finite, and the focus on healthcare personnel (such as doctors and nurses) will have to remain on top of the agenda, especially in the context of Brexit. We will need to think innovatively about how we widen the workforce, including capitalising on the lived experience of peer workers and attracting talent into the mental health sector: both will require continued efforts to tackle stigma and articulate the very real rewarding aspects of working in mental health. The Health and Care Workforce Strategy for England will need to address these issues deeper. It seems that for the first time in its 70-year history, the NHS has gone a considerable way to provide the promise of action to prevent mental health problems. To achieve this promise of prevention – as we have been consistently presenting at the Foundation – we will need to address the wider determinants of health, which most often lie in non-health domains (social, education, housing, criminal justice, family, labour). We now need to work together across the sectors to ensure mental health remains a priority within and throughout the implementation process. To achieve that, we are calling for a cross-government body to protect the ringfenced funds and the commitment to growth and to help focus on the specifics for the next Five Year Forward View on Mental Health. This should truly go beyond just the traditional clinical NHS services for people of all ages. At the Foundation, we will continue to support to build on this start and ensure we address those factors that continue to place our mental health at risk so that we can protect the mental health of the next generations as the most valuable asset we will hold. We need to capitalise on the positive steps being taken by the NHS, and ensure everyone has the tools to look after their mental health, and that their social circumstances allow them to thrive.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/70-years-do-we-understand-prevention,70 years on: do we understand prevention?,"We are all about prevention at The Mental Health Foundation, and 2019 marks 70 years since the organisation was founded, then known as the Mental Health Research Fund. As a charity, we focus on communities of people connected by certain characteristics they share. We do not deliver clinical services to people who are in distress. When one takes a 'macro' view like this, we don’t forget the individuals, rather we invest energy in understanding what makes people who belong in certain communities or walks of life more vulnerable to developing mental health problems than others. For example, we know that 'determinants' (a factor that decisively affects the nature or outcome of something) like living in poverty, not receiving a full education, or belonging to a group that is 'marginalised' or discriminated against put us at a higher risk of experiencing distress. And there has never been a more urgent time than now to focus on preventing this distress and subsequent problems. However, when discussing prevention, we don’t follow the narrow sense of the term. We know that mental health problems affect millions of us in our families, communities and workplaces. We all have mental health that will fluctuate in response to life events. It would be unwise to suggest that prevention is only for those who currently feel 'in good health'. We define prevention in the 'public health' (the health of the population as a whole) sense of the term. Under this lens,there are three types of prevention. Primary prevention focuses on stopping problems before they emerge. Primary prevention is relevant to all of us – often whole societies or nations – hence, solutions (or in our jargon: 'interventions') targeting primary prevention are called 'universal'. Examples of universal solutions include a national anti-stigma campaign that ensures we all follow the same standards when discussing mental health. Our universal work in the Foundation includes the Peer Education Project, which delivers courses enhancing 'mental health literacy' (knowledge and beliefs about mental ill-health which aid their recognition, management or prevention) in schools for all the students in Year 7. Universal solutions neither discriminate nor focus. Rather they intend to protect. We can all identify non-mental health-related universal solutions already in our lives, including banning smoking across whole buildings and making it mandatory to wear seat belts in the car. Often, a universal approach will aim to protect the most vulnerable community members in a non-stigmatising way, thus benefitting everyone. For example, mandating that all buildings have an accessible entrance means that people using wheelchairs can access space, but this is also handy for those carrying a large suitcase or delivering a large package. This can be extended to how we talk about health and illness. In mental health, ensuring that the language that we use is thoughtful and appropriate (e.g. on days when we struggle, saying 'I am feeling low' instead of 'I am so depressed') respects those who experience disabling symptoms while enabling an inclusive community. Mirroring this with our actions and legislations goes a step further to applying a protective 'filter'. Secondary prevention is the type of prevention that focuses on the people who share characteristics that place them at higher risk of developing a mental health problem. Thus, secondary prevention solutions (interventions) are often called 'targeted' or 'selective'. Examples of targeted solutions include enabling support for those who are lonely or marginalised, giving access to higher education for young people who are excluded from schools, or ensuring quick access to support for those who have experienced trauma or been victims of hate crime. For example, this is a big area of focus for us at the Foundation in our work with refugees. A range of experiences or characteristics we are born with places us at an increased risk of developing mental health problems. These in public health are called “inequalities” because they mean that certain groups of people face an unequal risk of becoming unwell. They can include being LGBT (as we know people might face a higher chance of being bullied) or having a physical health condition like diabetes (where we know that there is a 30% higher chance of developing a mental health problem like depression). Tackling inequalities in our communities means that we need to look into all these social, economic, environmental and other factors and invest a higher amount of energy in engaging people who might not immediately engage with universal approaches. Hence, these targeted solutions are often aimed at people experiencing some distress symptoms, and they are about intervening when it matters most. The third layer of prevention is called tertiary. This type of prevention has a lot to do with our quality of life when we have experienced a problem and reduces the risk for recurrence. Solutions (interventions) in tertiary prevention focus on people who are already affected by mental health problems and are often called 'indicated' solutions. Indicated solutions aim to reduce symptoms that can be disabling, limit complications of an illness, and empower people experiencing problems to manage their own symptoms as much as possible. Even though tertiary prevention works with people with a diagnosis, it is seen as distinct from treatment but complementary in that the goal is shared in reducing the severity of an illness and the risk of relapse. Indicated solutions are, more often than not, set in communities and not in clinical settings. Some of our work at the Foundation, which focuses on enhancing self-management (taking responsibility for one's own mental health support and well-being), is framed around the principles of tertiary prevention. Often the aim is to shift the focus of control from the clinician to the person who is using services in identifying what works best for them in their circumstances. For example, this year, we are starting a new project working with Irish men in Camden & Islington. This community is known to have mental health issues and doesn’t traditionally engage with clinical mental health services. The three types of prevention are not in competition or clashing in scope. Rather, to tackle an issue as common and widespread as mental health problems, we need whole society plans that invest in all prevention layers. Working together at the level of the national government, local authorities, and bigger or smaller third-sector organisations, we need to focus efforts on rolling out universal solutions that protect everyone while enabling targeted and indicated solutions supporting those at risk or experiencing problems. In public health, we call this holistic approach 'proportionate universalism'. This principle suggests that our actions should be universal (i.e. benefitting everyone), but with a scale that is proportionate to the level of disadvantage (i.e. more intensive for those experiencing higher risk or problems). The evidence is clear that although some of us are born with a higher genetic risk of developing a mental health problem, this is not deterministic. Even in the most “likely” cases (e.g. an identical twin whose sibling lives with a diagnosis of schizophrenia), the hereditary risk (characteristics or diseases passed from the genes of a parent to a child), seems to be less than 50%. Hence, we need to invest more in the relationship of these internal factors with the societal factors that shape our lives. This is well understood in physical health when talking, for example, about the prevention of heart disease or lung cancer. However, globally, mental health still lags behind physical health in terms of spending and funding. To address mental health problems, we would need a concentrated effort as a society to tackle those persistent inequalities with prevention and early intervention.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/reclaiming-our-heritage,Reclaiming Our Heritage,"In 2007, the Mental Health Foundation held the first everScottish Mental Health Arts Festival(SMHAF). Since then, it has grown to be the largest and oldest mental health festival in the world and as such it has become a significant part of the Scottish cultural landscape. Our latest arts project, Reclaiming Our Heritage, sets to record and preserve the rich cultural heritage in Scotland which surrounds the arts and mental health community. The Foundation has successfully accessed funding from the National Lottery Heritage Fund for this two-year project. Using oral testimonies, we will be exploring a time period of roughly 50 years, from the 1960s up until the mid-2000s when SMHAF was first established. Testimonies will be gathered by a group of 20 volunteers from across Scotland who will be taught new skills in oral history and heritage. The training has been really interesting, and it’s been good to meet other people who are involved in the project. We’ve learnt quite a lot about each other just through the trial interviews! It is our hope that through gathering these hidden stories from artists, community groups, service users and more that we will be able to offer a new narrative around mental health in Scotland. Often, our history is cast with memories of asylums and the impact of stigma and discrimination. However, as managers of SMHAF, we know that the artistic community have played a vital role in promoting positive messages around mental health. We all have mental health and art has been used as a tool to open conversations and challenge ideas for decades. We want this project to expand the public’s perception of what mental health is and can be, to promote the cultural significance of this social movement. People will have a chance to access snippets from the archive through theSMHAF websitein 2021. A mobile exhibition will also showcase the findings from the project, allowing others to learn more about the mental health and arts movement in Scotland. It is our hope that through gathering these hidden stories from artists, community groups, service users and more that we will be able to offer a new narrative around mental health in Scotland. One way that the Mental Health Foundation supports using the arts to improve mental health is through the annual Scottish Mental Health Arts Festival (SMHAF). Now one of the largest festivals of its kind in the world, SMHAF brings together communities, artists and activists from all over Scotland to be creative and engage with arts events exploring mental health, including film, theatre, literature, visual arts, dance and comedy.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/refugees-behind-every-statistic-there-person-and-life-matters,"Refugees: behind every statistic, there is a person and a life that matters","DuringRefugee Week, we took some time to reflect on the issues that force people to flee from their countries and their loved ones. Our aim was to try and understand the impact that fleeing from war and persecution has on people’s mental health, made worse when one arrives in a country where they don’t understand the language, culture, or system. When we talk about integration, let’s include asylum seekers' and refugees’ voices in mainstream forums so that they feel less isolated and ultimately empowered to thrive in their new homes. I know only too well the consequences of divisions and armed conflict, precisely what drove my family and me away from my country to seek a new life in Scotland. Sadly, we live in a world that “has a population of 70.8 million forcibly displaced people”of which 29.9 million are refugees.[1]According to the UNHCR, in 2018 28 people were forced to flee their homes every minute. Behind every statistic, there is a person and a life that matters; all of us deserve a chance to fulfil our aspirations and dreams. Beyond the moral argument, let’s remember our legal responsibilities to protect and safeguard refugees under the 1951 Refugee Convention.[2] We are currently celebrating Refugee Festival Scotland and the meaningful contribution refugees make in our society. This is an opportunity to connect communities but also to raise awareness of the experiences of asylum seekers and refugees here in Scotland. In our journey to “help people to thrive through understanding, protecting, and sustaining their mental health”, we have established theRefugee Health Policy and Strategy Action Group, a national project equipping asylum seekers and refugees to take a greater role in advocating on issues of mental health and wellbeing, both locally and nationally. In line with national policy frameworks such as the New Scots Strategy and Volunteering for All, we have helped establish a pool of mental health advocates to address the longstanding issue that refugees are less likely to receive mental health support than the general population, due to cultural and language barriers andstigma. While we are proud of thevision of the New Scots Strategy, Scotland’s innovative plan for the integration of asylum seekers and refugees, we must also ensure that individuals and groups are fully included in society. TheRefugee Health Policy and Strategy Action Groupare focusing in Glasgow on how asylum seekers and refugees can have a better voice and visibility in health, housing and education civic forums. In North Lanarkshire, Syrian refugees are engaging with the local community through storytelling and individuals are connecting with their neighbours by being the authors of their stories. In North Ayrshire, we are exploring gardening as a means of social enterprise. There comes a time when one needs to pause and reflect, and I was fortunate to have had that last week in Northern Ireland. I was delighted to receive an invitation from the Social Change Initiative to attend their annual convening to explore the theme of “border and boundaries”. It was an amazing opportunity to meet new people and to reflect and learn from some formidable global human rights leaders. Alongside the discussions, I was exposed to the issues of contested space and segregation along the peace walls in North and West Belfast. At a time of UK-wide division, it was great to disconnect from the general narrative, instead meeting and learning from local people, who possess encyclopaedic insights into the Troubles (with the consequent impact on people and communities), as well as conflict resolution and reconciliation. I had enlightening conversations about the potential repercussions of Brexit with individuals involved in the peacebuilding process, and what that might mean for the future of Great Britain. As put by a fellow participant, it was truly an “eye-opening, brain-popping” experience.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/excellence-youth-work-see-me-youth-champions,Excellence in Youth Work: See Me Youth Champions,"This year, in partnership with NHS Health Scotland, we sponsored Scotland’s first ‘Mental Health and well-being’ award at YouthLink Scotland’s National Youth Work Awards 2018 to recognise the power of youth work when it comes to helping young people to stay mentally well. We spoke toSee Meabout their Youth Champions. At See Me, we have one big message for young people in Scotland, that it is okay not to be okay. This is a message that came from our Youth Champions and one that we want to become part of everyday life for young people, and the adults in their lives. It’s so important because we all have mental health. Our Education and Young People’s programme is all about empowering young people, to look after their own mental health, to understand why stigma and discrimination are so devastating, and to help them look out for their pals. We do this though a Whole School approach where staff and pupils can learn and work within a supportive community in an environment free from mental health stigma and discrimination. Stigma isn’t just an issue that impacts adults. We did research which found that just 37% of people aged 15 to 25 years would tell someone if they were finding it difficult to cope, whereas 78% would mention it to others if they were physically ill. Young people reported that they often struggled to find the words to describe how they are feeling. We have 36 Youth Champions, who all have experienced tough times with their own mental health. They train pupils to be Schools Champions who can lead in changing cultures in schools. We think it is so important to have young people working with and training young people, in things like Scottish Mental Health First Aid (SMHFA) and the WOYM pack. Things change quickly when you’re young, and most of our staff haven’t been in school for at least ten years, so we want pupils to be able to relate to the people who are training them. We are the only youth programme in Scotland with young volunteers who have been trained as trainers in SMHFA and are training other young people in the qualification. Young people felt that having the same training and knowledge in every school was important so everyone would know where to get support. The pack has had 686 downloads, 142 people trained in Scottish Mental Health First Aid (of which 61 are pupils) 42 staff attended peer workshops and 349 pupils have attended peer workshops. The resources and training are free to download and accesshere. In the spirit of this involvement, we thought it was best for one of our Youth Champions to help us answer this one: Through volunteering for See Me as a young champion I’ve seen first-hand the positive impact our campaigns have had on young people. See Me really listen to what their volunteers have to say and I think that’s why their campaigns are so successful; they target the issues that real people are facing today. I think it really helps to have young volunteers going in to teach other young people about mental health issues, stigma, and help-seeking (particularly going into schools), because it’s easier for the young people to relate to us and feel comfortable speaking their mind instead of seeing us as teachers. It’s amazing to see the transformation in schools that have worked with See Me, both in the attitudes of the students but also in what help the schools provide and the confidence of the teachers to provide this help. There has definitely been a shift in mental health culture over recent years. Being a volunteer has also had a big positive impact on my own life. I’ve met other volunteers with similar experiences to my own, who really understand what it’s like to walk in my shoes, and we’ve also been able to learn from each other’s differences; some of them are now my closest friends. I’ve learned so much about how to express my opinions and experiences effectively through the media, how to plan and lead workshops for groups of young people, and to make funding pitches. Training me in mental health first aid has given me the confidence to help others who are in a mental health crisis and signpost them to appropriate help. These are all things that will really help in my own future career, where I hope to continue working in mental health or public health. Volunteering for See Me has shaped who I am as a person, giving me the confidence to speak out about issues surrounding mental health and to encourage others to seek help. Working within the mental health sector and with young people is incredibly rewarding, however, at times very hard work, making it difficult to prioritise our own well-being. What we do have is a working environment where it's okay to be human, where we display empathy and compassion and feel able to discuss our feelings whether positive or as a result of challenges. We ensure that there is space to be honest about our own well-being and ensure a network of support within the team to ensure that we are embodying the message that we share with our youth volunteers. This may be through supporting others in tasks to manage workload, organising a walk at lunch, allowing time to decompress after a stressful period, ensuring we refill each other's cups of coffee, and even just checking in with a ‘how are you doing today?’. Our organisation also puts support in place such as the Employee Assistance Programme, providing a safety net of support to ensure our well-being. #ItsOkayToNotBeOkay 30th Oct 2025

Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. Mental Health Foundation works across the UK to bring together policy, research and practice in mental health. Today, our Scotland policy team look forward to the Scottish Parliamentary elections in May, and the forthcoming Scottish Government mental health strategy. We are calling for robust political discussion of mental health during the election campaign, followed by a commitment by the next Scottish Government to a cross-departmental approach to mental health policy - not just a technical, mental illness-focused mental health strategy. We believe that the next Scottish Government should deliver a comprehensive policy approach to mental health to: We have five asks, which we believe frame a requirement to build outwards from compassionate, rights based and recovery-focused mental health services, to a framework for building mental health as a national asset for Scotland’s future. A comprehensive, prevention-focused strategy for mental health policy in Scotland, bringing together a drive for improved mental health services with a vision to improve mental health across our communities We want to see an in-depth exploration of how the Scottish Government can use the powers now available to it to address the social and economic determinants of poor mental health and disparities, including options to mitigate the effects of challenging UK policies in Scotland. Increasing our focus on prevention in mental health policy does not replace the urgent need to continue to focus on addressing mental health conditions when they arise. Prevention of distress, of relapse, of crisis, ofsuicide, and of lost opportunity and failure demand should address the issues that see people with mental health problems die younger and be disproportionately subject to inequalities. In turn, this enables people to be more active in communities, use fewer services, and lead lives they value. To achieve this, it is critical that we maintain pressure to achieve social justice in mental health via support for evidence-led programmes such as See Me, which explicitly focuses on mental health inequalities. We need to see flexible, equitable access to health and social care services that act early, hold hope, and focus on creating the circumstances for a person to thrive, not merely exist. That is critical for avoiding the economic and social impact of health inequalities that can lower life expectancy by 20 years. Commitment to put into practice the 2011 Christie Commission recommendations with regard to addressing inequality, failure demand and co-production in mental health, in the context of wider public service reform Five years ago, the Christie Commission recommended that future delivery of public services in Scotland should have a presumption of addressing inequalities, a presumption of addressing failure demand, and use co-production to engage communities. We believe that these have not been fully implemented. With health and social care integration underway and primary care reform on the horizon, now is the time to supply the leadership to change this. We must prioritise prevention in mental health, even in the face of austerity and challenge, because the downstream risk of failure demand created by abandoning existing programmes such as early years support orsuicide prevention, or rowing back from developing new approaches, will only lead to a future unmanageable demand for services. Commitment to recognising the unique role of mental health in achieving our national outcomes, coupled with improved mental health literacy to enable mental health impact to be recognised A key aim of all manifestos for government is to enable Scots to be healthier, happier, safer, more productive and engaged in their communities. These macro level political ambitions are in keeping with the factors that promote mental health and enable resilience. How we feel, how we act, and the connections we make are key to success for education, economic development, community, health, justice, equality, transport and sustainability policies which build the national outcomes the next government will set. With increasing localism, local structures, including Joint Integration Boards and primary care structures must have an understanding of and a due regard for mental health and wellbeing.This mental health in all policies approachhas gathered traction across Europe and we have a huge opportunity in Scotland to use our national outcomes framework to implement this. Commitment to supporting the development of comparable data and research evidence in mental health, coupled with a commitment to support and evaluate innovation in mental health The Mental Health Foundation is an evidence-led organisation. We recognise that there must be a commitment to supporting mental health research that evaluates innovation, develops and synthesises the evidence base and brings this into practice at street level. We should draw on theROAMER roadmapfor mental health research in Europe. We want to see a commitment to evidence-led scaling of innovation, based on evaluation, learning and original research across the spectrum of mental health and wellbeing – too often we see promising pilot practice discontinued because resource cannot shift to accommodate it. We need to see a mental health data development plan for Scotland to provide improved, comparable data on mental health outcomes, service use, and services across Scotland. This should bring together data onmental health indicatorswith data on inequalities, economic impact, and service use. It must explicitly include data on the mental health of those with protected characteristics, particularly around ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation. Establishment of a high-level commission on mental health in Scotland, to develop a human rights-based vision for mental health at the heart of Scotland’s future The Foundation is proud to support theScottish Mental Health Partnership call for a high-level commission on mental health in Scotland. In the past decade we have been fortunate to support two national reviews of mental health services, and a review of public mental health in Scotland. All of these were snapshots in time. Mental health is a skeleton key that can unlock the challenges Scotland faces around health inequalities, attainment, equality, and poverty. In recent years we have seen concerted effort for instance in early years youth services and education through theGetting it Right for Every Child (GIRFEC) approach. GIRFEC is a policy approach that has achieved transformational change at all levels. We are calling for the same type of unifying, holistic approach to addressing mental health across the life-course in Scotland.

Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. Mental Health Foundation volunteer Shirley Hellyar spoke to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon about mental health discrimination and what can be done to reduce the stigma around mental ill-health. ""Personal stories of recovery can inform and inspire people with experience of mental health problems, carers and service providers alike. Learning about other people’s experiences can also help to challenge misconceptions. Stories offer hints and techniques on recovery and recognise the fact that people in recovery are experts by experience, stating very clearly that people can and do recover from even the most serious mental health problems. Recovery means being able to live a good life, as defined by the person, with or without symptoms. Any event which brings people together to discuss and promote mental health and understanding is to be welcomed and festivals such as these provide a way into opening these discussions."" ""Health includes mental health and it is important to recognise the rights of people with mental health problems, and how these are threaded through every aspect of life. The distribution of mental health problems across the population varies considerably according to age and social circumstances. Although effective treatment exists for most conditions, with recovery rates that are comparable to those for many physical diseases, lack of awareness and stigma affects the likelihood of somebody seeking and receiving treatment."" ""Scotland should be proud of its commitment to improving mental health. Its visibility and awareness has risen substantially during the last decade. There is better public awareness of mental illness and the sources of help. Building on this progress, in March of this year we launched our new 10 year Strategy to transform mental health services in Scotland. The new Strategy reflects our vision of a Scotland where well-being flourishes. Where a focus on equality, prevention, support, human rights and recovery means good mental health for all. Where people can get the right help at the right time, expect recovery and fully enjoy their rights, free from discrimination and stigma."" ""Treating people once they become ill is only part of the story. We want to support people to stay well which is why our Strategy will focus on shifting the balance of care towards prevention and early intervention, particularly for children and young people. Shifting the balance of care towards primary and community care is a major priority within the new Mental Health Strategy. ""The poor life expectancy of people with lifelong mental illness is unacceptable. I expect this this to change. We have included in the new Mental Health Strategy a focus on how we can improve the physical healthcare of people with mental health problems. There are things we can measure over a relatively short timescale that should contribute to a longer-term improvement in health and life expectancy. For example, improving access to screening, a focus on smoking cessation and supporting people to manage their weight and take part in physical activity."" ""Yes, and we have positive examples of initiatives in Scotland that look to bring people together to discuss and promote mental health. For example the 'Walk a Mile' initiative brings people together, including together professionals, carers and people with lived experience, to speak about mental health and 'walk a mile in each other’s shoes', addressing stigma and promoting understanding conversation by conversation."" ""Mental health distress is something that affects everyone and is just like physical health distress in that a range of responses is needed to best fit the problem. The Scottish Government is committed to improving how services respond to people in distress so that they get the best support no matter where or when they seek help or how they come into contact with services. ""Distress can be entirely normal and self-limiting requiring no external support beyond good coping strategies, like exercise and talking to family and friends. However, if it persists you can access online information through NHS 24 and itsNHS inform website. Breathing Space offers free and confidential advice for people experiencing low mood,depressionoranxiety, whatever the cause. They can be contacted on 0800 83 85 87, or you can also accesswww.breathingspace.scotwhich provides a wide range of useful information and advice about coping with low mood, depression and anxiety. ""If distress persists and may be symptomatic of mental disorder the person can use their local primary care service who in turn can refer to specialist mental health services if appropriate. In emergencies NHS 24 111 telephone service can be used and Samaritans provides a confidential telephone service forpeople feeling suicidalyou can contact Samaritans free on 116 123. ""Responding to distress was part of the work of the last suicide prevention strategy, this work will continue in a newsuicide preventionaction plan that the Scottish Government is creating following engagement events. The Scottish Government is also funding a distress brief intervention service in four pilot sites across Scotland.""

Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. Disappointment, fear and frustration are not the feelings traditionally associated with a New Year, but as we look towards January 2022, this is what many of us are feeling as the pandemic spikes yet again. My family spent the holidays in self-isolation, a small reminder of the way this pandemic disrupts our lives and of those who have lost so much more. But, as the New Year beckons, it has never been more vital to find and hold reasons to hope. Thanks to the huge efforts of the scientific community and our fantastic NHS, vaccines have made us much safer than a year ago. But, as we all know from experience, there’s no vaccine for the mental health effects of the pandemic.Loneliness, fear, worry, hopelessness and frustration have affected many millions of us. Our own researchsuggests that these difficult experiences are especially common among groups of people who were disadvantaged even before the pandemic. So, as 2022 knocks on our door, what keeps me more hopeful than afraid? One encouraging trend I see is people’s growing understanding and appreciation of mental health. Last week, I met a business leader whose company employs thousands of staff. Despite trading for 30 years, he said he had only just recognised that unless the business does more to attend to the mental health of its staff and customers, it cannot fulfil its potential. Mental health is now part of the discussion about how we should deal with new waves of coronavirus. There’s widespread recognition that uncertainty, isolation, financial worries, and unemployment can be devastating for people. But also plenty of room for more effective government action in response. Public discussion about how the pandemic has affected us psychologically is itself helping to demystify mental health. There seems to be a greater understanding that it’s something that we all have, every day and that it’s affected by what we do ourselves and by things that happen to us. We are also understanding that because the prevalence of mental ill-health and suicide increase as you move down the socio-economic ladder, addressing mental health is a social justice as well as a health issue. Media coverage is helping with understanding mental health – it has been more thoughtful in relation to the pandemic than any previous global event. I am also heartened by the many powerful demonstrations of public support for mental health, including for us at the Mental Health Foundation. It’s an ongoing reminder that people know and passionately care about the profound, daily difference that mental health makes to all our lives. So, to the many who have supported us through 2021, I thank you so much. We couldn’t have developed andexpanded our workwithout you. And being hopeful is different from complacency. We still need to see a dramatic shift towards prevention. By the time people need mental health services, we have already failed them by not addressing the things that we know create distress. The experiences of poverty, including food poverty, insecure housing, insecure employment, unemployment, abuse and neglect, as well as poor access to green spaces, loneliness and isolation all increase our risk of poor mental health. They are barriers to us meeting psychological needs like safety, dignity, meaning, empowerment and connection, all of which are essential for good mental health. Both national and local governments must work more closely with communities, charities and individuals to tackle these barriers and give everyone the same opportunities to thrive. At the Mental Health Foundation, we will keep making this radical case in the year ahead. We will also keep responding to the pandemic, as we have since it started. We will continue to expand our COVID-19 advice hub and keep using theevidence from our studythat tracks the pandemic’s effects on mental health to inform and influence governments and other decision-makers. We will expand our Covid Response Programme, which across the UK is responding to the needs of people who, research suggests, have been worst affected by the pandemic. Alongside this, we will continue a wide range of other work, including supportingchildren, families, and young people, as well asolder adults. DuringMental Health Awareness Week, we’ll highlight loneliness and its consequences for us all. Hope can co-exist with struggle. While there will be tough times ahead in 2022, let’s do all we can to hold onto hope and work for change. Let’s continue to fly the flag for mental health and the many ways that we can all, individually and collectively, care better for it and for each other. Especially in these days, I wish you and yours a hopeful, mentally healthy New Year.

Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. Perhaps it is not surprising that an area of health that has been systematically stigmatised for so many decades has historically settled for a discriminatory lexicon. Generations of people have grown up in societies that found terms like “psycho”, “schizo”, “loonie”, and “crazy” perfectly acceptable. Stigmais not only an element of mental health, of course, but the extent to which it has permeated our language, compared to any other area of ill-health, is astonishing. Many would argue that it is practice and not language that matters. But words are a barrier to help-seeking and a motivator for making discrimination acceptable. It can be a provider of a context for many people, which further entraps them in a vicious cycle of thinking that they’re suffering from “something” that they really shouldn’t be – or worse, that this “something” is somehow defining them as lesser members of their communities. Words are a barrier to help-seeking and a motivator for making discrimination acceptable. A big body of research from the past few decades has helped better our understanding of how the human brain works and the associations it makes. Psychologists and behavioural economists, among other disciplines, have defined our thinking in terms of two “systems”. Compared to our Thinky Brain, which is relatively young and immature in its development (talking in millennia terms), our Feely Brain has developed over millions of years. He includes natural skills that we share with other animals. In our human context, it completes several highly complex associations every minute that help us lead our normal lives. Our Thinky Brain tends to be lazy and uninvolved unless prompted, so our Feely Brain largely guides our thinking. Our rapidly thinking Feely Brain is always looking to make simplistic causal connections (so that we can get the impression that what we first think is also what is true). This is particularly important when it comes to our language. Evidence shows that our Feely Brain easily and effortlessly takes charge in producing a response to words. This is called “associative activation, "" a simple result of seeing or hearing a word. A word brings an idea, and an idea triggers many other ideas. Our Feely Brain keeps making connections between all those ideas by resurfacing memories, which recall emotions that bring other reactions. It is a cascade of activity in our brain that happens quickly, with no virtual conscious control. It produces a series, or a pattern, of cognitive, emotional and physical responses. That’s right, we respond to words without even realising it. If we understand the important processes that words trigger in our brains, we may decide that it is worth being more thoughtful in the words that we use to describe mental health. Some words, like “nutter” and “mental”, are clearly discriminatory and should not be used. Then there are words that have originated in different contexts and have evolved over the years, making them too emotionally charged to use in our modern context. In a similar way that we would struggle to understand what someone meant by “Inbox”, “Unfollow”, and “Selfie” 10 years ago, the use of words like “psychotic” and “neurotic” are today outdated and stigmatising. Our language is evolving. How we talk about mental ill-health in our immediate environment is also critical and evolving. An important example is a suicide. We often say that someone has “committed suicide”. The use of the word “committed” originates when suicide was considered a crime and a sin. You commit a crime, or you commit a sin. Suicide is neither. Thankfully we seem to be slowly getting towards a global consensus on this (though not entirely there yet). Given the impact suicide can have on the bereaved family, friends and colleagues, it would be much more thoughtful to use expressions like “took his/her own life”, “ended his/her own life”, or “completed suicide”. If someone has attempted suicide and survived, sometimes we say they’ve been “unsuccessful” at taking their own life. However, when we say someone has been “unsuccessful”, it almost implies that we wanted them to “succeed”. Our language is emotionally charged. It is important not just how we talk about problems and diagnoses. Remember that 1 in 6 of us is experiencing high levels of distress or a common mental health problem every week therefore being respectful and thoughtful in our mental health-related language could do wonders for our brain’s “associative activation”, and, hence, the emotions of the people around us. As we’ve covered before in thisblog series, mental ill-health impacts fundamental parts of our personal identities, like our relationships, work performance and educational outcomes. In the way we have framed our societies, people with long-term mental health problems can struggle to recover their personal identity (as a parent, spouse, co-worker, volunteer, student etc). Therefore, how we talk about this experience of mental illness could play a positive and influential role in the recovery process for millions of our fellow citizens. Identifying someone as simply a “patient”, “service user”, or a “schizophrenic” implies that this is all the person is - that this diagnosis defines them. Instead, describing someone as experiencing mental illness can help to allow for other parts of their identity to still exist. We often use the word “suffer” regarding mental ill-health. While acknowledging the actual impact and suffering that people experience is accurate, we also need to be careful not to imply that a diagnosis equates to a “life sentence” of suffering. We now know that following a diagnosis, we can engage in positive recovery pathways, thrive in our workplaces and be dependable family members. So, if we instead use expressions like “people who use mental health services”, “people who experience mental health problems”, and “people living with depression”, we could achieve a more holistic and accurate view of the experience of ill-health. For people who have been in contact with mental health services, contrasting views about language may be worthy of reflection. Exploring people's thoughts around such terms can be useful to help us reach a shared understanding. For example, “Mad Pride” has been used to reclaim the language around mental health. It became a movement involving past and present users of psychiatric services. It seeks to reverse the negativity of experiencing poor mental health and stresses that people should be proud of their ""mad identity"". This is further complicated from an evolutionary perspective.A lot of the activity happening in our Thinky Brain triggers emotions that would have been normal and protective some tens of thousands of years ago (e.g. our ancestors got angry to protect themselves against a threat and sad to ask for help and treatment). But for our Feely Brain and our language, negative emotions “have to be” problematic. It can be useful to explore what thoughts people have around such terms, to help us reach a shared understanding. In recent years, we have come a long way in public mental health in terms of our attitudes around and our efforts to tackle the stigma of ill-health, but we are not there yet. It remains true that several thousands of our fellow citizens experiencing symptoms of mental ill-health will not seek professional clinical help because of the stigma attached to mental illness and the fear of being misunderstood. Media, retailers and social media have been playing a role in the persistent use of stigmatising, stereotyping and offensive language: We are still exposed to unhealthy imaging and expressions. The fact that there is a strong response to such unfortunate uses of words is encouraging. The potential of humour to help address stigma is welcome, but as a rule of thumb, trivialising or “adjectivizing” diagnostic terms should have no place in our societies. For too long, most campaigning efforts in psychiatry and public health have focused on increasing the understanding of the biological model of mental illness, i.e. the physical, organic and biological aspects of illness. We now know that social circumstances play a huge role in developing mental health problems. Research shows that while this increased understanding of biology leads to greater acceptance of professional help, it hasn’t really changed the attitudes towards people with mental illness. A greater understanding of the social circumstances that we grow and live in – which expose us to risk or gather protection for our mental health – is needed. We cannot change this understanding unless our language evolves. We need more efforts across society for everyone to be the change they’d like to see. We don’t need to wait until we get on the other end of the spectrum to change how we talk about mental health. And when it comes to talking, with great power comes great responsibility, so high-reach media should come on board this evolution. Little by little, through citizen activism and a new generation of celebrities willing to open up about their own experience of mental health problems, our language is slowly catching up with the centuries of mystifying mental illness. We are now well beyond the times when we thought that if we locked up people experiencing symptoms we don’t understand, they might stop existing. We know that mental health problems exist in our homes and communities, they are common and can be addressed throughprevention, timely treatment and concentrated societal effort. Addressing the crisis starts with talking about it in an appropriate way.

Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. Statistics can tell us a lot. Theytell usthat in the last recorded year (2016), 5,688 people died by suicide in Britain. Men are around 3 times more likely to die by suicide than women, but the female suicide rate has been at its highest since 2011. They can tell us that suicide is the largest cause of death for men between the ages of 20 and 49 years old in England and Wales. But statistics don't tell us everything. They can never tell us why someone decided to end their life. They can never convey the devastating impact that suicide has on a family and the wider community. Four years ago, my older brother, Daniel, took his own life. It was a decision that was both fatal and final. But the more I understand about mental health, the more convinced I am that Dan’s decision could have been prevented. I thought of Dan last year as acoroner’s inquestgave its finding into the death of 18-year-old Edward Mallen, who wasliving with depressionand ended his own life. The inquest found that Edward's GP had referred him to a specialist mental health team following disclosure ofsuicidal feelingsand recommended that he be seen within 24 hours. However, following a triage mental health nurse conversation, he was downgraded to a five-day wait. The NHS Trust in questioncommented: ""It's not clear that if the Trust had done everything, it could have done that Edward would have lived, but the Trust didn't do everything that could possibly be done, so we can't know and we must therefore accept some responsibility."" It was a similar conclusion that I came to following the inquest of my brother, who died on the hospital grounds of an institution charged with his care. These deaths raise a key issue in the prevention of suicide. In physical health, early intervention is recognised as being crucial – in cancer care, for example, services are designed to ensure that people can access care and treatment as quickly as possible following diagnosis in the knowledge that this improves the chances of recovery. This same message also needs to be embedded into mental health, and it is the message that has galvanised Edward Mallen’s father, Steve. Steve Mallen committed at Edward’s funeral that some good would come out of his death – his response was to set up the MindEd Trust, ""which is focused on the prevention of mental illness in young people and early intervention strategies for those experiencing trauma."" As evidenced by Edward's death, Steve is responding to the desperate need to prevent children and young people from reaching a crisis. It is about the healthcare system responding to clear signals of distress and providing adequate and timely support. It’s not an easy fix but achievable with adequate funding and training (and a much-needed commitment to bring about change, which Steve is fighting hard to achieve). We know that suicide prevention works, a global review of suicide prevention strategiespublished recentlyin the Lancet Psychiatry concluded that combinations of evidence-based approaches do work. Be that and including restricting access to the means of death, school-based awareness programs and the effective treatment of depression. All of which are crucial starting points. But, these approaches alone will not enable us to reduce death by suicide significantly. The knowledge that prevention works raise the question: how can we reach and support people who don’t directly reach out for help? The big task ahead of us is to tackle the causes of distress, such as the real or perceived pressures of expectation. These pressures can be societal or individual to the person who experiences them. Still, young people and adults can include concerns about present, academic attainment and future success and pressures to conform and fit in. In older people, these pressures can be around finances, debt, unemployment, addiction and isolation. We also need to cultivate a culture where it’s okay not to be okay, and the opportunity to be heard in a safe space exists. We need to look beyond the surface, past any veneers which could create the illusion that things are going well for a person who is in pain. There’s a disparity between our hidden ideas of who can legitimately experience mental health problems and the reality which anyone can. Increasing mental resilience may form part of the solution, but as a society, we also need to urgently define these pressures and seek ways to tackle them. Answers will not be easy, they are likely to require whole-community approaches and the consideration of the wider impact of government policies on mental health. But as a society, we need to begin to ask whether we are willing to accept the continued price of lost lives by suicide and if not, strengthen the movement to bring about change and aim for zero suicides.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/ten-top-tips-good-sleep,Ten top tips for good sleep,"When we don’t get good sleep, it can contribute to various problems, including depression and anxiety. But it can sometimes feel hard to achieve amid the pressures of daily life. To help, we have come up with these top ten tips on how to get a good night’s sleep. The bedroom should be somewhere that we associate with sleep. Where possible, you should try to remove distractions from your bedroom. It is better to watch TV, check social media and eat in another room. This will allow you to relax with no distractions in your bedroom. Be mindful of the presence of gadgets and electronics, such as computers, phones, tablets and TVs. The backlit 'blue light' displays suppress melatonin production – the hormone that helps you sleep; the suppression of melatonin causes sleep disruption. You should stop using these devices two hours before you go to sleep to reduce their impact on your sleeping. Anyone who has tried to get to sleep with a blocked nose or headache knows that physical health problems can stop you from getting a good night's sleep. It can be easy to forget minor symptoms, but you will thank yourself when night falls if you prioritise speaking to a pharmacist about appropriate medication for symptom management. It may sound common sense, but too much light and background noise can prevent you from falling asleep or staying asleep. Eye masks or earplugs are wonderful investments for light and noise sources that you can’t control. Temperature is also important, and if you share a bed with a partner with different temperature preferences, consider separate blankets or other solutions that compromise less sleep. Thinking about sleeping too much or forcing yourself to sleep will only keep you awake. Learning how to relax your body and mind instead will help you get to sleep much more easily. Progressive relaxation techniques can help you to relax and unwind at these times. Eating rice, oats and dairy products can produce chemicals that increase our desire to sleep. As well as the obvious caffeine, in terms of food and drink to avoid, things high in sugar can keep you awake if consumed late in the day. A big meal after mid-evening can also stop you from sleeping. Although it can make you feel tired and can help you get to sleep, alcohol often impairs the quality of your sleep and makes you more likely to wake up during the night as the effects wear off, and you may need to go to the toilet frequently or wake up dehydrated to drink water. Exercising regularly can help us sleep, helping to reduce anxiety and relieve stress. Exercising earlier in the day is better, as exercise increases the body’s adrenaline production, making it more difficult to sleep if done just before bedtime. If you have trouble sleeping, you may be tempted to catch up on sleep by napping. However, unless you’re feeling dangerously sleepy (while driving or operating machinery, for instance), this usually does more harm than good as it makes it more difficult to sleep at night. If you feel tired during the day, get up and walk around, get some fresh air, or do something challenging for a short while, like a crossword or sudoku. If you’re finding it difficult to get to sleep, don't just lie there worrying. Get up for a while and drink (no sugar or caffeine, remember!). Try reading for a little while and go back to bed when you feel a bit sleepier. Keeping a sleep diary to note the conditions when you went to bed the night before can be useful for letting you look back and see what has and what hasn’t worked for you. It also helps you to see how your sleep varies from night to night and might help you note sleep patterns. We all need to sleep well to help our bodies recover from the day and to allow healing to take place. Sleep affects our ability to use language, sustain attention, understand what we are reading, and summarise what we are hearing; if we compromise on our sleep, we compromise on our performance, our mood, and our interpersonal relationships. 11th Sep 2025

However, we know that work is a primary cause ofstressfor many of us. We can all relate to feeling stressed at work - a deadline looming, too many tasks to cram in and, sometimes, fear of making a mistake. A survey forMental Health Awareness Weekhas shown: But reducing stress in the workplace is possible, and we can all do something to help. Here are some top tips for you to help yourself, to help colleagues, and for line managers and employers. Make sure you pay attention tohow much sleep you need– and prioritise good sleep when you face busy work periods. Use the breaks you have in your working day and your commute to ensure you get away from your desk/work area and do something different for yourself. Make sure you plan and use your holidays; if you become unwell, take time to recover. Many of us run to caffeine,alcoholor junk food when we are up against it. If you are starting to feel overwhelmed, tryeating nutritious, healthy meals regularly and increasing your water intake while reducing caffeine and alcohol. Don’t eat at your desk or grab a sandwich on the move. Try and get some exercise in your day– even if it's just a walk around the block between tasks. If you like the gym, it can help, but try not to exercise late at night as it can affect your sleep. Take time to be with people you care about and to who you can vent – friends, partners and family are often happy to let you vent.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/nhs-digital-mental-health-children-and-young-people-england,NHS Digital Mental Health of Children and Young People in England,"Location:England NHS Digital has published anew analysisto complement their2018 publicationon the mental health of children and young people in England. Theoriginal statisticslooked at the prevalence of mental health problems in English children broken down by age, ethnicity, and social and economic influences. However, the relationships between these factors are complex. They may be associated with each other and mental health problems. To help untangle these relationships, NHS Digital conducted a new analysis to look at the association between each of these factors and mental health problems while accounting for the influence of a range of other potentially related things. This is often referred to as “controlling for” or “adjusting for” these factors.  This can help us understand the unique influence of a factor on the likelihood of mental health problems when other variables (like gender or ethnicity) are held constant. The analysis looked at the influence of factors in the following categories on the likelihood of having a mental health problem: Several factors were consistently associated with amuch higher likelihood of any mental health problem across all age groups.These included: Children whose parents reported poor mental health were much more likely to have a mental health problem than children whose parents reported good mental health. Across age groups, the odds of children whose parents reported poor mental health having a mental health problem themselves were two and a half to nearly three times greater than children whose parents reported good mental health.1 Being the child of a parent with a mental health problem is a unique and complex experience. In one review of the research, children described knowing something was wrong, even if adults felt they were too young to understand or wanted to protect them from too much responsibility. Both parents and children spoke of the potential benefits of learning more about mental health as a way to provide the vocabulary and knowledge to speak about it openly in the home or with friends and peers.2 Programmes that aim to support children whose parents struggle with their mental health often focus on this educational component alongside other forms of support (e.g. cognitive or behavioural support, peer support, family support)3, and there is some evidence to suggest that these approaches can help to lower the risk of developing mental health problems in these children.4 Children whose parents received income and/or disability benefits were much more likely to have a mental health problem than children whose parents did not receive benefits. Across age groups, the odds of children whose parents received benefits having a mental health problem were over two times greater than children whose parents did not receive benefits.5 This matches a previous review of the research, which found that socioeconomically disadvantaged children are two to three times more likely to develop mental health problems, particularly if this disadvantage is sustained over long periods of time.6 A range of other factors, such as family functioning, were associated with the likelihood of mental health problems in different ways depending on the age of the young people and the type of mental health problem. More information on these relationships can be found in theNHS Digital report. It is important to note that these things were all measured at the same time. This means this analysis cannot tell us if parental mental health problems or receipt of benefits necessarily cause mental health problems in children. While this could be the case, it could also be that child mental health problems contribute to poorer parental mental health, or something else that wasn’t measured can influence parental mental health, child mental health, and receipt of welfare benefits. However, this adds to what we already know about social and economic factors' effect on mental health and helps us to build a better picture of what these often complicated relationships look like for children and young people in England. Understanding more about the factors that are strongly associated with mental health problems in children and young people can provide avenues for policy and practice intervention. Therefore, providing support to children of parents with mental health problems and families receiving benefits may be important routes to improving the mental health of children and young people in England.​ We are passionate about the transformative power of research to create change in people’s lives, their communities and workplaces, in services and policy. 30th Oct 2025

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/what-its-have-bipolar,What it's like to have bipolar,"This content mentions suicide or suicidal thoughts, self-harm, personality disorders, substance abuse and addiction (which may include mentions of alcohol or drug use), trauma, anxiety and depression. Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. A blog by Chris O'Sullivan. I was diagnosed withbipolarin my late teens, in my first year at university. The diagnosis (and not – I hasten to add – the symptoms) have shaped my adult identity and experiences. People with bipolar experience both episodes of severedepressionand episodes of mania – overwhelming joy, excitement or happiness, huge energy, a reduced need for sleep, and reduced inhibitions. The experience of bipolar is uniquely personal. No two people have exactly the same experience. Bipolar disorder has been associated with genius and with creativity. It is certainly true that several contemporary high achievers and creatives have spoken of their experiences. Throughout history, it is possible to recognise bipolar-type traits in the artistic, political and academic spheres. But what is it actually like? I was lucky enough to speak to a range of people with bipolar to demonstrate the range of experiences out there and some of the things that help. Read on to learn more about their experiences with bipolar. For me, this is important because my experience is very unusual. I took antidepressants in my last year of school, which, when I arrived at University and took the control of living away from home, helped to induce hypomania. I was already aware of my mood swings and studying biomedical sciences. I went to the doctor and said I thought I had bipolar, and he agreed. I met a superb psychiatrist via student health. There were a few unusual people in my extended Irish family, and at least two with probable bipolar a working diagnosis was quick. Mood swings coloured my school and university experiences. I cycled rapidly between deep depression and hypomania. I ate too much anddrank too much, partly because of themedicationand partly because ofanxiety, and became very obese. I had some embarrassing moments of drunkenness,self-harm, obnoxiousness, and accrueddebt. By the time I felt properly back on an even keel seven years later, I had accrued nearly £50,000 of unsecured debt, which had taken a decade to pay back. I don’t have a house or a postgraduate degree, which I’d have liked and which would help now. But. I had my life. Thanks to my psychiatrist, brilliant GP, online peer support, and carefully nurtured insight, I avoided the hospital. And because I found a sense of purpose through volunteering. My parents were unquestioningly supportive financially, emotionally and practically. They resolved to push me through my degree at whatever cost. I am lucky they were able to. I got involved in the student union movement and student mental health campaigning, which led me to my career. Bipolar shaped me. But never broke me. Nowadays, all I have left is a ghost of an identity formed from a diagnosis. Sometimes my self-stigma or real stigma inhibits my career. Sometimes casual disclosure leads to awkwardness. But. I am recovered. I’m constantly probing for where recovery ends and post-mental illness starts. I am so aware of how a-typically bipolar I am and how lucky that makes me. Every time my heart swells with empathy for a fellow traveller in trouble or dead too young, I thank my stars. And commit to continuing the work I do. Other people I spoke to had a range of views. “It's shaped my life because I became unwell in my teens, which resulted in me dropping out of school. Becoming unwell at such a critical period in my life shaped my self-image, and I struggle withsocial anxiety. “Episodes can be pretty destructive, and it means I find it very difficult to take anything for granted – no matter how well my life is going, I know I can get ill, and it can be wiped out, as it has been many times before. I had children for a long time because I was frightened of getting ill. “The positive aspects are that when I started blogging about it, I tapped into an entire network of people who had felt the same, who were living with all, and it gave me hope.”  “I feel that having bipolar disorder has been both a curse and a blessing. The negatives focus on some of the more harmful actions I have taken as a result of the disorder, such as falling into self-medicating habits which lead to addiction. “Bipolar has provided some heavy limitations, such as having time off work and needing rest when episodes come along unpredicted and being unable to look after my young daughter when it is in full swing. “However, in good light, it has also separated my true friends and family from the false ones who did not care for me in the first place. I am very lucky to have a close circle now. Each person I know truly values me and sees the real person that I am through the disorder.”  “I've had numerous admissions to hospitals and crisis houses, taken overdoses, cut myself, and put myself in very dangerous situations when manic. “All of those things have been awful, but they don't even begin to compare to how soul-destroying it has been not to have the life I once believed was a given taken by bipolar. As a teenager, I was a high achiever. I was destined for academic and occupational success, but I haven't been able to work since I was 18, and I had to drop out of university because I was too unwell. “Being unable to have that life has forced me to find other ways to feel productive, valuable, and successful. I volunteer, study part-time with the Open University (I will finally get my degree next year. I started university in 2009!), and earn a small income from blogging.”  Living with bipolar, often for years, teaches you a lot about yourself, mental health services, medication…and sadly, often aboutstigma, shame and discrimination. I’d say for me, it was a key driver for learning about me…but also a red herring as I feel I vested too much of my own identity in clinging to the life raft of the diagnosis as an explanation of my life in my early 20s…again though, there is a range of perspectives. Keeping well when you have bipolar is an interesting concept. For some, it revolves exclusively around managing moods. For others, it means fitting life around moods. For me, and others like me who are deep into a recovery that seems to be holding, it’s about keeping an eye and investing in the things that help us all boost our mental health. For many, if not most people with bipolar, life and keeping well includestaking medication.  “The thing I most prioritise with keeping myself well is to be strict in taking my medication. Missing doses or tweaking them without professional help can be devastating.” Again, I’m going to buck the trend and say I don’t take medication routinely. I took lithium for a decade and then wanted to try tapering off once I knew myself and had done my research. That was eight years ago, and I’ve managed it. I did it carefully, over two years, with support, whilst learning other techniques.  “For 13 years, I took medication, but I've been trying to cope without it for the past six months. So I have to be super careful, and alas, super boring. I don't drink a lot. I have relatively early nights when I can.” Bipolar can also betriggered by traumaor other life events, and sometimes part of therapy is addressing underlying concerns to get someone to a point where they can start to see a life worth living.  Based on all the insights shared, we’ve come up with the following list…but it’s not exhaustive. Speaking personally, I’d say, “Hold on. It gets better. Different. But better…” With grateful thanks to all who contributed to this piece, your names have been changed to preserve your identity.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/why-loneliness-theme-mental-health-awareness-week-2022,Why loneliness is the theme for Mental Health Awareness Week 2022,"This content mentions loneliness or isolation, which some people may find triggering. Our CEO Mark Rowland shares his own experience ofloneliness, explains the theme forMental Health Awareness Week(9 to 15 May 2022) and invites you to share your stories, break the stigma and be part of the movement to tackle loneliness. Loneliness is something that we all feel at times but when it is chronic or long-term it can have serious effects on our mental health. We all have a part to play in reducing loneliness. ""I was in my early thirties the first time I knew I was lonely. My marriage had disintegrated, I was living in a new flat and I was travelling 120 miles a week to see my young son. The feeling of loneliness was crushing as I struggled to keep in contact with friends and family at exactly the time when I needed them the most.!"" -Mark Rowland Loneliness is a normal part of life, with most of us feeling lonely at some point and experiencing how it can gnaw away at our sense of self-worth and belonging. Loneliness is not about the number of friends we have, the time we spend on our own or something that happens when we reach a certain age. Loneliness is the feeling we experience when there is a mismatch between the social connections we have and those that we need or want. That means it can be different for all of us. This Mental Health Awareness Week, we want to give loneliness the attention that it deserves, bringing it out from the shadows where it so often is hidden. We will release research to show the embedded misunderstanding and prejudice around loneliness, and why the length of time we experience loneliness is so vital to its effect on our mental health. We will explore the shame we often feel and how many of us still struggle to talk about loneliness and how it is affecting our mental health. Loneliness is a significant public health issue. It remains one of the key indicators of poor mental health,our own reports have shownthat being connected to other people in a way that helps us feel valued is absolutely fundamental to protecting our mental health. Long-term feelings of loneliness have also been shown1to be associated with higher rates of mortality and poorer physical health outcomes. This was shown most clearly in the well-known Harvard Study2, which since 1938 has tracked 268 Harvard undergraduates and their children to explore what makes us who we are, from physical and psychological traits to social life and IQ, to how we flourish. It found thatthe warmth of our relationships throughout life had the greatest impact on our life satisfaction and health. “…embracing community helps us live longer and be happier.” -Harvard Study of Adult Development. One of the few consolations of the pandemic is that it reminded us of our need for each other. OurMental Health in the Pandemic studyshowed that COVID-19 brought the experience of loneliness closer to millions of us.During the lockdowns, we found that loneliness was almost 3 times that of pre-pandemic levels. Connections with loved ones, friends, family and everyday relationships were disrupted, or in some cases broken. This loneliness wasn’t experienced in the same way across our communities. People with long-term physical conditions, people on lower incomes and people with existing mental health problems were more likely to experience loneliness compared to the general UK population. Older people’s risk of loneliness was influenced by factors like whether they were digitally connected. It is why our work on projects likePicture Thisis so important, but also why we need more wide-ranging solutions and deeper social change. The week will be an opportunity to ask vital questions about how we will reduce loneliness as we continue to come out of the pandemic, and live with Covid-19 in a different way. The Mental Health Foundation will be releasing a policy briefing on the action that can be taken by national and local governments in a number of areas of our society to enable more human connection. And we’ll be taking those ideas directly to MPs in Westminster during the week, and also making representations to governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. There is so much you can do during the week. Take the chance to get in touch with a friend or neighbour you haven’t spoken with in a while.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/level-or-not-level,To Level Up or Not Level Up,"Here, Michael Hough, the Foundation's Public and Policy Affairs Officer, talks about the effects on mental health and what needs to happen next. Given the current state of world events, it would be understandable if you had already forgotten aboutthe government’s levelling up white paper. News has certainly moved on quickly since the government published its 332-page document last month. However, the white paper contains important concepts and policies which will be at the forefront of the debate around public mental health and prevention over the coming months and years and needs further consideration. Before considering the white paper, it's useful to set out what we mean by ‘public mental health.’ As a concept, this can sound quite academic, but, simply put it concerns the prevention of poor mental health through preventive work involving communities, organisations, wider society and individuals, and the promotion of mental health across the course of all our lives. The white paper centres on12 national missions, all to be achieved by 2030. These include missions directly aimed at the health sector, such as improving well-being in every area of the country and reducing the gap in healthy life expectancy between different areas and regions. These are the missions that would appear to be the ones of most relevance from a public mental health perspective. Several other missions have the potential to affect public mental health, as preventive action is needed across a range of areas. These include commitments to enhancing broadband capacity and developing 'pride in place'. The white paper also touches on the concept of travel. The importance of transport and subsidised travel cannot be understated. This has been demonstrated to improve social connectedness, reduce the risk of loneliness - our theme forthis year's Mental Health Awareness Week, and allow those from all age groups and backgrounds to be positively involved with society, thereby enhancing their mental health and well-being. This is particularly true for those in later life. To benefit those most at risk of poor mental health, subsidised travel on public transport is just as important as improved transport links. There is still a need for further government thinking in this area. At the moment, the white paper does not include any additional or new funding commitments but instead brings together several schemes announced in previous spending reviews. Reaction to the white paper has been mixed. Labour spokesperson, Lisa Nandy, described the white paper as “smoke and mirrors” and SNP spokesperson Tommy Shepperd suggested it was “frankly insulting.” But not all reaction has been negative. The white paper was tentatively welcomed by several mayors including Labour Mayors Tracy Brabin and Andy Burnham. This support wasn't without some warnings, with both Brabin and Burnham keen to see more detail. Away from our leading politicians, some in the health sector expressed frustration that the white paper does not go far enough to tackle the health disparities that currently exist in the country. TheHealth Foundationargued the white paper “has failed to grasp the enormity of the challenge.”It would be fair to say at present there is cautious optimism about some aspects of this white paper, but also a sense that there are areas where it can and should be improved. What this all means is that there is no specific mention of public mental health in the white paper, which is disappointing. While there are discussions about policies and issues that directly affect public mental health, this is restricted to schemes that have been previously announced, with limited evidence of new thinking or policies. This partial focus on mental health is notable, especially given that mental health is a critical factor for realising all the aims of the paper. To achieve its aim of levelling up the country and reducing health inequalities and disparities, the government needs to prioritise mental health at the community level in a way that is sadly absent from this white paper. Instead, the government is putting lots of emphasis on its forthcoming white paper on health disparities, which is due in the next couple of months. Time will tell whether this will address this omission. To do so, it must include specific proposals for improving public mental health by addressing the structural social and economic inequalities that need to be tackled to genuinely ‘level up’ the circumstances of those living in the most disadvantaged communities, which increase their risk of poor mental health. For many still facing significant health and social disparities and poor mental health, the need to improve outcomes not just in the health sector but also across other sectors is imperative. While this white paper sets out some notable and creditable intentions, it does not include any real detail on prevention or on public mental health generally. Over the coming months, the Mental Health Foundation will be working to influence the next stages of this levelling-up white paper and the important white paper on Health Disparities. The work will focus on demonstrating that prevention of poor mental health is not only possible but is also urgently needed, ashighlighted in the Mental Health Foundation’s latest reportsetting out the economic case for investing in prevention. This shows that poor mental health costs the UK economy at least £118 billion per year and sets out the case for all parts of government to invest in well-evidenced and cost-effective prevention programmes. The Foundation will also be responding to the forthcoming mental health and well-being plan discussion paper. The development of the mental health policy tool, a commitment made in the government’s COVID-19 mental health and well-being recovery action plan, will be crucial in supporting long-overdue mental health in all policies approach across all government departments. Additionally, this work will also be enhanced by an active engagement to convince the government of the importance of considering the impact of all their policies on mental health. To achieve the necessary improvements in people’s mental health, it is important these various policy strands are brought together in a coherent cross-government programme for prevention and early intervention. But the early signs aren't promising. The Chancellor’s recent Spring Statement failed to announce any new measures for those on Universal Credit or who are reliant on the safety net of the benefits system, meaning that they will not rise in line with inflation. This will have serious and long-lasting effects on many vulnerable people. The government still has a chance to put this right and needs to seize the opportunities of its forthcoming Disparities white paper and mental health and well-being plan to genuinely level up and in doing so deliver the changes that are desperately needed to current policy and resource allocation. 7th May 2025

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/pretty-pixel,Pretty as a pixel,"This content mentions eating disorders and body image or generally discusses weight, which some people may find triggering. As the government prepares to launch its Online Safety Bill, we look at the impact of image editing apps on mental health and some changes we'd like to see to the bill to help protect young people. YouTuber Haley is trying to show girls how their Instagram heroes tweak their bodies digitally, presenting unrealistic – in fact, unreal – images of themselves to their followers. “First, we’re going to fix my hairline. I hate my hairline. It’s really, like, weird.” Yet as she demonstrates the image-editing app FaceTune, she becomes visibly excited, drawn into what she can do to perfect herself. In seconds her hairline is ‘fixed’. She moves on. “We’re going to just make my waist teeny-tiny.” “Of course,” she adds. She’s busting the myths of how the Insta-famous get their looks, but at the same time can’t hide her delight as a flick of her finger gives results one would need to pay thousands to achieve surgically, and with considerably less discomfort. These apps are, quite clearly, fun. Fun like a house of mirrors if you push the extreme waist-shrinking slider to its maximum. Or if you have a little more restraint, they’re fun like having your own Vogue airbrushing team; to sharpen your cheekbone just slightly, to iron out those wrinkles you always get when you smile for the camera. Like many of life’s pleasures, we ought to ask, though, whether these apps are good for us. The answer is unsurprising. Creating perfect versions of our bodies - the bodies we grow up in, live in, and know, with all their imperfections - and launching these buffed, slimmed avatars into the digital parallel universe is not, it turns out, good for our mental health. We were so concerned about the shame and distress people can feel about their bodies that we made it the focus ofMental Health Awareness Weekin 2019. As part of this, we carried out research that showed that getting on for half of teenagers have had worries about theirbody imagethat they directly attribute to social media. It affects girls more, but boys are not immune. In addition to these worries and the shame young people can feel about themselves, the research shows that having a negative body image is associated with severe mental health problems such as body dysmorphic disorder andeating disorders (like anorexia and bulimia). We should also ask why people feel they need to alter their images in this way, and what can be done about it? These are timely questions, as the Government prepares to launch its Online Safety Bill. The Bill attempts to balance freedom of expression with the duties and responsibilities technology companies have to their users. It covers a lot of bases, attempting to address everything from terrorism-related content to preventing online harassment. It says nothing, though, on the more subtle harm of promoting unrealistic images of so-called ‘perfect’ bodies. Unlike, say, sending a death threat online, this is a harm that functions by accretion. Let’s not pretend a single instance of airbrushed cellulite will hurt anyone very much at all. But when all you see is conventionally ‘perfect’ legs, tummies, faces, served to you algorithmically because that’s what keeps you scrolling, that’s a different matter. Scrolling even as your mood sinks, and you start to experience your own body as more and more inadequate, a sign of failure, or an object of disgust. That’s when young people start to face real risks. To be clear, teenagers are not to blame for this. Image-editing apps are made by profit-making companies that know exactly what they’re doing. They function within a social media ecosystem designed to keep people scrolling, regardless of the emotional consequences. Much of the most dangerous content is not really made by individuals at all, but by advertisers working with ‘influencers’ through paid partnerships with beauty companies, which are sometimes declared transparently, but often are not. We want apps designed to adjust users’ bodies and faces to be available only to adults. We want a requirement for individuals to have control over the types of content presented to them algorithmically on social media, with the safest setting being the default. They can then avoid being presented with such an overwhelming volume of images of conventionally ‘perfect’ bodies. And we want users to be given control over the type of advertising they receive, so they can avoid being presented with excessive amounts of advertising showing this sort of imagery. These are proportionate recommendations. As it happens, they would do more than just protect young people from this type of material: we could all do with some more control over the content served to us by secret and impenetrable algorithms. We and others have been raising the alarm loudly and clearly on these dangers for some time now. The new Bill presents the perfect opportunity to fix this part of the online world that’s harming us so greatly: the Government must seize it. If you feel affected by the content you have read, please see ourget helppage for support. Our research found that 30% of all adults have felt so stressed by body image and appearance that they felt overwhelmed or unable to cope. That’s almost 1 in every 3 people. We consider it vital that we take action to understand how these apps influence people’s body image and their mental health. It is an industry that is growing largely unchecked, in a space where the potential to negatively impact people’s lives is significant. 7th May 2025

Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. Why? Well, that's a very good question! If you’re going to do something that’s hard, you’d better have a clear idea of why you’re doing it in the first place. Especially when it comes to running. Every reason you can find to persist is like a pillar in the centre of a house that stops it from collapsing. So, this blog is part of my race strategy! I picked up running in my early 30s and I haven’t stopped. It’s been a brilliant way for me to process and organise my thoughts, deal with difficult emotions, build friendships and experience new vistas. To this end, I’ve decided to try to run theSouth Downs Way 100 miles racein June andraise vital funds for the Mental Health Foundation, which I have the privilege to lead. The goal is to complete the course in under 24 hours. I’ll need to get roughly 15,000 calories into my body, climb 12,700 feet and take at least 160,000 steps to reach the finish line. Every single donation I receive will be another reason for me to keep going. But why on earth go for 100 miles? Well, here’s a few reasons. Almost ten years ago, I lost my brother Daniel tosuicide. It was a shattering tragedy that I’m still learning to live with. I want this run to honour his memory and be part of my journey of turning that terrible event into something that also brings consolation and healing. Despite so much being spoken about mental health and much great access to support, we’re still in the foothills of understanding how to protect and support our mental health – and what that means for us as individuals, communities and as a society. We still find it difficult to ask for help and too many of us have lost too much to allow this issue to fade away. I believe passionately in the need for more understanding, action and investment in preventive steps on mental health and funds raised for this run will enable us to do that. I’ve always loved adventure, being absorbed by nature’s beauty and taking on challenges that tested my limits. This yearning for adventure has grown, especially after the last two years we’ve endured. Last year, I completed my first 50-mile race. In the pain of the aftermath, I made my family promise not to let me run a 100-mile race. I was convinced the combination of another 50 miles wouldn’t be good for me and I may have been right! And yet, I’ve decided to lace up again. The promise of adventure, and all the comradery and fun that comes with it, is probably the biggest motivation. It’s my way of feeling fully alive. The feeling of relief and pride in taking on something I found difficult have been some of the best moments of my life. I haveTheodore Roosevelt’s poem, Daring Greatly, on my wall. It is a reminder to me to challenge the fear of failure and to set audacious goals for the things I care about. Buried in the human psyche is the need to have something we value to work for. We deeply need to find and give meaning to our lives – and personal or professional goals are a good way to achieve this. We talk a lot about the value of our work/life balance, but I prefer to think of it as having work/life ‘energy’. I need things in work and out of work that give me fresh impetus, perspective and a sense of progress and they fuel my activities in other aspects of my life. Goals help me settle my restless soul and I’ve noticed that as I have done so, the ruptures of existential angst have receded. There is essentialism to running. The ego fades. You are left with your bare humanity in a state of complete exhaustion and that’s a great place to be! There’s something about the physical vulnerability of running long distances that gives me clarity and reminds me of what’s really important and what I value most in life. In everyday life, it can be easy to lose track of that. There are so many distractions and I find running helps position what and who I care for, right at the centre of my attention. So, these are my reasons; to remember, to adventure, to dare greatly and to anchor myself. Seems like four very good reasons to take on this 100-mile challenge.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/how-was-christmas-and-new-year-you,How was Christmas and New Year for you?,"This content discusses trauma, which some people may find triggering. A blog by Jolie Goodman I’m writing this in mid-January 2022. I’ve always been uncomfortable with the new year; the 'new you' push in January. Feeling that despite the continual barrage of ‘advice’ to make personal changes and new year resolutions, ultimately, we still take our head with us. It may be a new year, but it’s the same old you. This January we’re all experiencing the accumulation of many not-so-smalltraumasand challenges that have been accumulating over the last couple of years. For people working in the NHS and social care environments, the challenges of managing their experiences, keeping going and having the ability to replenish their resilience, remain inconceivable to those of us on the outside of those worlds. I havewritten before about loss, but loss in this pandemic is cumulative and 22 months in we are all heavily burdened. In the virtual world of my workplace, I have been hearing about the small and not-so-small traumas of colleagues’ December. For me, my December was about dodging COVID-19, particularly Omicron, as cases in London soared. First, my daughter caught it, then my mother (who is now in a care home). Both recovered. There was the suspense of who we would be able to see over the festive period, and then wondering if it was inevitable that we were about to succumb. There doesn’t seem to have been enough discussion about how we look after ourselves considering the extra stresses and uncertainties that COVID-19 continues to bring. Acknowledging the issue seems an important starting point. Why should we be ok when our lives are so different? It may well be a helpful idea to embrace uncertainty, but the volume is so very loud, the noise is deafening. For me, it’s acknowledging the changes in our lives, how complex issues are; like having a mother in a care home, which is all so much harder, even though we’re not in lockdown. When we were in lockdown there was less ambiguity, at least for those of us who kept to the rules. I’ve found conversations with colleagues and friends help to see ‘my December’ in the context of a collective experience. I’m feeling relieved that COVID-19 cases are down to 120,000 rather than 200,000. It’s not only what happened in December, it’s what’s going on today. We have all struggled and made sacrifices about social distancing - when those in charge appear to disregard their own rules about this. This has had an unsettling effect on many, particularly those who lost loved ones last year and couldn’t see them. This is leading to a lack of trust in those in power. (Now it seems that rules are being relaxed which may feel like another uncertainty). Lots of people have said that adjusting back to work has been particularly difficult this month. It’s hard to concentrate in this ongoing heightened state of alert. Today I’ve been in a meeting with someone who had just tested positive, someone who’s feeling a little better after being ill for a week and someone else who is working very flexibly after being ill over Christmas. When an MP on Channel 4 news is talking about how many years it will take to address the trauma and long-term impacts of the pandemic, there’s a sense that perhaps the conversation is shifting towards a greater acknowledgement of all our traumas. Since the start of the pandemic 2.3 million people have come forward for NHS talking therapies. The Mental Health Foundation highlights the importance of thinking about what a mentally healthy society looks like. As far as I’m concerned, it’s when we can say that we are struggling and have that validated as acceptable, given the circumstances in which 2022 has begun.

Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. Shari McDaid, Mental Health Foundation, and Peter Kelly, The Poverty Alliance. We were proud to launch a new partnership between The Poverty Alliance and Mental Health Foundation. Together we will carry out an ambitious research and policy programme to address poverty as a fundamental driver of mental ill-health. We will conduct research along with members of the community and community organisations on the source and impact of poverty stigma on mental health. We will examine how current and potential social security policies such as Universal Credit affects the mental health and well-being of people, families and communities. We will explore the mental health effects of employment policies such as zero-hours contracts. Our research will produce evidence-based recommendations for the improvements that will result in good mental health for all. Our mental health is shaped by our environments. Our social, economic, and physical environments all play a part in building and maintaining our well-being. It is astonishing that in 2022 we are still living in a vastly unequal society. Mental health problems are not evenly distributed across the whole population. Poverty, inequality, and discrimination place some people at a much higher risk. Poverty is a key driver of mental health problems. More than 1 million people and almost a quarter of all children in Scotland live in poverty. Studies suggest, compared to those living in affluent areas, adults living in Scotland’s most deprived areas are twice as likely to experienceanxietyordepression; are three times more likely todie by suicideand are 18 times more likely to have a drug-related death. Research by Public Health Scotland has also identified children in the lowest-income households are four times more likely to experience mental health problems, with consequences extending into adulthood. As if the challenges of living every day uncertain ofwhether you can afford adequate food, shelter or warmtharen’t damaging enough, people who are living in poverty must contend with unfair labels and perceptions of being lazy, incompetent or liars. Thisstigmaand the suggestion that poverty is caused by a personal failing can negatively impact a person’s confidence and self-esteem, further driving the likelihood of developing a mental health problem. A focus on reducing poverty is a focus on improving mental health. We at the Mental Health Foundation in Scotland and The Poverty Alliance are committed to working together towards change. We hope that this year will be among the last where we are still despairing of high rates of poverty and inequality in Scotland and the negative impact it has in every area of people’s lives. To make this hope a reality, we must work collaboratively with experts and organisations across Scotland, and with the participation of people directly affected by poverty and poor mental health. Governments, charities, the private sector, communities, and people affected by poverty taking collective action will help us create the Wellbeing Society that we all need to thrive. Today we are hosting a virtual roundtable event to bring experts, including people with lived experience of poverty and poor mental health, and organisations together as we make a start on this vital work. We are delighted that our work is being welcomed and supported by so many across the Third Sector, academia and government. We are optimistic that this work will drive real positive change for people in Scotland. The partnership is being led by Dr Pamela Jenkins at Mental Health Foundation andFiona McHardyat The Poverty Alliance.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/set-theme-yourself-new-year,Set a theme for yourself this new year,"After living through another year in a pandemic, there is a real need to take a compassionate look at self-development and our mental health in 2022. We are going to give you tips and tricks on ways to be a little kinder to yourself in the year ahead. Take a read, reflect and set your theme… With the New Year comes the temptation to hop on board the change train of ‘self-criticism’, head to carriage ‘unrealistic expectations,’ and ‘comparing to others’ and trundle on to destination ‘new and improved you’. Purchase a ticket for the change train and find… a more vibrant, healthy, driven, goal smashing, habit breaking, 100 billion new skills acquiring you by December 2022. With all this expectation you can arrive feeling overwhelmed and a little disappointed. New Year self-improvement can be a positive thing with benefits for your mental and physical health. This year when thinking of self-improvement, find things that work for you, irrespective of what others are doing. And remember to ask for support if you need it. New Year's resolutions can be fuelled by unhelpful self-criticism. ‘A festival of finding ways in which we are not enough’. So, instead we propose that you try setting a theme. Resist the urge to strive for an entirely new you in 2022. Instead accept you last year, today and tomorrow. Approach personal growth, habit change and goals with a kinder self-talk that cares for your mental well-being. Evaluate therelationship you have with yourself. Ask would you speak to somebody else in the way you speak about yourself? The relationship you have with yourself is crucial to your own well-being and to creating healthy and happy relationships with others. Being kind to yourself regularly is one of the best things you can do. Here’s to taking time to accept yourself in 2022. Try to resist the urge to join up to the latest fitness fad as soon as 1 Jan arrives. Instead take a deep breath, pause and think about what ways you would like to nourish your body and mind this year. Involve others in your goals: social support is a great motivator. Share your experiences, goals and achievements. People can have a renewed drive for positive change in the New Year and when channelled calmly and kindly this can have great results for your physical and mental well-being. Physical activity is available to all, has few costs attached, and can be tailored to your needs. Here’s to nourishing your body and mind in a way that works for you this year. For more information on nourishing yourself with exercise please download our ‘How to look after your mental health using exercise’ guide for free. Try to bring intention into your actions through mindfulness this year. By doing this you can counter the New Year urgency to sprint back into autpilot when January arrives. Use mindfulness as a tool to help you pay attention to the present moment. You can try techniques like meditation, breathing and yoga. It can help you to become more aware of our thoughts and feelings so that, instead of being overwhelmed by them, we’re better able to manage them. Mindfulness has been shown to have positive effects on several aspects of whole-person health: including the mind, the brain, the body, and behaviour, as well as a person’s relationships with others. Take a minute a day to bring intent to you – mindfulness doesn’t need to take a lot of effort or time... to be precise it can take just one whole minute, 60 seconds, 60000 milliseconds! For full descriptions of the one minute mindfulness techniques and for more information on mindfulness please download our ‘How to look after your mental health using mindfulness’ guide for free. Here’s to bringing intention into yourself in 2022. This year, when you start to feel overwhelmed or stressed, pause, be your friend and ask yourself: Is this level of stress causing me a problem? Can I identify the causes? What small changes can I make to my lifestyle? Could I … eat healthier, exercise, take time out, be mindful, get some rest and sleep, and most of all be kind to myself. Here’s to taking time for yourself in 2022. For more information of managing and reducing stress please download our ‘How to manage and reduce stress’ guide for free. Now it is over to you – what is your theme for 2022? Download our template for free and share your theme on social media and tag our accounts: We have created a template to help you think of ways to choose yourself this year, instead of joining the change train. What ways do you want to gently approach self-development and New Year’s resolutions? What would you like to guide you throughout 2022? In what ways will you accept, nourish, bring intent and take time for you this year? In 2020, we found that 63% of UK adults agree that when other people are kind it has a positive impact on their mental health, and the same proportion agree that being kind to others has a positive impact on their mental health.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/why-nature-was-theme-mental-health-awareness-week-2021,Why nature was the theme for Mental Health Awareness Week 2021,"‘There is something to be wondered at in all of Nature’ - Aristotle In the first lockdown, I called an elderly friend. She lives alone and had recently had a fall. Separated from her community, she had lost all in-person contact. When I asked her how she had got through it, she told me it was taking daily comfort from watching the birds sing to each other on the fence and the flowers re-emerge from the frosts of winter. During the long months of the pandemic, millions of us turned to nature. Our research on the mental health impacts of the pandemic showed going for walks outside was one of our top coping strategies, and 45% of us reported being in green spaces had been vital for our mental health. Websites showing footage from wildlife webcams saw hits increase by over 2000%. Wider studies also found that people not only spent more time in nature but were noticing it more during lockdowns. It was as if we were re-discovering at our most fragile point our fundamental human need to connect with nature. Nature is so central to our psychological and emotional health that it’s almost impossible to realise good mental health for all without a greater connection to the natural world. For most of human history, we lived as part of nature. In the last five generations, so many of us have lived and worked in a context that is largely separated from nature. And it is only since a 1960s study in the US found that patients who were treated in hospitals with a view of nature recovered faster that science has started to unpack the extraordinary health benefits. During Mental Health Awareness Week 2021, we pulled together the evidence demonstrating nature's powerful benefits for our mental health. We looked at nature’s unique ability to bring consolation in times of stress and increase our creativity, empathy and a sense of wonder.It turns out that it is not just in nature but how we open ourselves up and interact with nature that counts.We showed that even small contact with nature could reduce feelings of social isolation and effectively protect our mental health, and prevent distress. Nature is our great untapped resource for a mentally healthy future. Despite this, many of us are not accessing or benefitting from nature. Teenagers, in particular, appear to be less connected with nature and around 13% of UK households have no access to a garden. We want to challenge the disparities in who is and who isn’t able to experience nature.Nature is not a luxury.It is a resource that must be available for everyone to enjoy - as basic as having access to clean water or a safe roof over our heads. Local and national governments need to consider their role in making this a reality for everyone, and we will be talking about how they can do so during the week. We had two clear aims. Firstly, to inspire more people to connect with nature in new ways, noticing the impact that this connection can have for their mental health. Secondly, to convince decision-makers at all levels that access to and quality of nature is a mental health and social justice issue as well as an environmental one. 2021 is going be a huge year for nature: a new Environment Bill will go through the UK Parliament, which will shape the natural world for generations to come; the UK will host the G7 nations, where creating a greener future will be a key priority, and a historic international UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) will be hosted in Glasgow in November. There could not be a more important time to understand the links between nature and mental health. Stories are the best tools we have to influence change. Without us demonstrating nature’s role in bringing solace and joy to our lives, it will remain undervalued and under-utilised. We heard your stories of how nature has supported your mental health. This might be as simple as tending to a house plant, listening to the birds, touching the bark of trees, smelling flowers or writing a poem about our favourite nature spot.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/we-didnt-cause-climate-crisis,We didn’t cause the climate crisis but give the younger generation the power to fix it,"Attending theMental Health Foundation COP26 eventwas an incredible experience. From listening to all the keynote speakers to the amazing discussions in the breakout rooms. It’s obvious that everyone who was there acknowledged the issues that we face. The climate crisis also comes with 'climate anxiety'. Specifically with young people. The power and control it can have in people’s daily lives isn't spoken about. I am a part of a generation that's growing up with the climate change alarms continuously going off. It becomes difficult to do anything when it feels like the environmental sirens won’t stop. The world is facing issues that history has never faced before. It’s time that the world takes an approach that it's never had to take before. Young people are full of innovation, new perspectives and ideas. We don't have the platform. We don't have a vote of confidence.It’s time for change and it’s time to give us a turn at tackling the issues that were left behind for us. The conference saw so many individuals who are excited about putting young people in the lead, and that's what we need more of. We need more professionals, we need more support and we need more belief in our young people. We are growing up with problems we didn't create, yet it's inspired a revolutionary thought process amongst young people. The experience of growing up with the constant talks of sustainability and being green has invoked the power of inspiration and innovation. It is my generation that can and will solve this, but we cannot do it without the support of other generations. My peers and I are reaching the point where we have to choose between the environment and our dreams. No person, ever, should have to put their dreams on hold because of mistakes that aren’t theirs. Students are taking the sustainability and carbon footprint of universities as factors of where they choose to go. People are having to evaluate the carbon footprint of their dream careers.This is what climate anxiety can look like.It’s not just long-term decisions but the daily decisions, of where a person decides to shop, where they decide to travel, what they decide to wear. If you are raising a generation that has to live a lifestyle because of your choices, it is only fair to let that same generation have a voice and have a seat at that decision-making table.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/llandaff-north-rfc-and-mental-health,Llandaff North RFC and mental health,"This content mentions suicide or suicidal thoughts. Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. My name is Kira Philpott, and I’ve been playing rugby at Llandaff North RFC for 4 years.The girls at the club have been monumental in my rugby journey and have allowed me to feel part of a strong family unit and support me both on and off the field. At North, we are all genuinely good friends, so we all look out for one another and go the extra mile for each other. It is no secret that the number of people suffering from poor mental health is rising. News stories of people dying fromsuicideare at an all-time high and show no sign of slowing down. I can’t help but feel a responsibility to do my part in ensuring that we, as a team, are aware of the conditions, symptoms and commonality of mental health problems. If I can somehow lessen thestigmaof talking about your mental health and seeking help when needed in our team, I will feel like we are moving in the right direction. Just like physical health, we all have mental health, so we must look after it as much as we can. At the rugby club, we have physiotherapists and First Aiders that will cater to all our complex needs to maintain our physical health and let me tell you, none of the girls is afraid to see the physio when they have a little niggle, bit of an ache or a bruise! So, where do we go if we want to seek help with our mental health?Whether that’s having a chat about a crap day at work, needing a good rant or cry or even wanting information on mental health services available to us. Well, that would be me! From having first-hand experience of the positive effects a “go-to person” can have on a team from Heather Lewis, Cardiff Blues Ladies Chaplain, her work has inspired me to put my hand up as the Wellbeing Lead for Llandaff North. Now, I’m no professional; for some girls, I might not even be the person they want to speak to, which is fine. But if just one person needs a shoulder to cry on or signposting to further services, I’m your girl. Although I’m not completely clueless, I am qualified in ‘Mental health first aid for young people’, which does give me some knowledge on how to help people at crisis points and who that person needs to be referred to. It’s not my job to diagnose people, ‘cure’ people or deal with mental health problems that are too complex for my rather limited knowledge and experience. Small but powerful steps taken at North included markingWorld Mental Health Day(10 October 2020). After training, the girls returned to the clubhouse for some food, well-earned sweet treats, and cakes in favour of a smalldonation to the Mental Health Foundation. The girls really bought into this evening and even competed in teams to answer a Mental Health Quiz - they’re a competitive bunch! This gave the team a chance to have a chat, catch up and destress. With the topic of mental health being on the table, conversations soon started to flow, and people were able to get things off their chest if they chose to. Moving forward, post-Christmas, the team will get together for afundraising challengeto raise even more money for the Foundation, as it's close to all our hearts. Some of the girls are even having input in the Foundation's “How to look after your mental health and wellbeing as an elite athlete in rugby”publication. I can’t stop people from experiencing poor mental health. Let’s face it: 1 in every 4 people will have to deal with a mental health problem at some point in their life. But what I can do is help lessen thestigmathey face when they do go through it. It’s not a grand gesture, and it’s not about doing it for the credit or to tick a box. I am doing it because I want the best for the girls in my team, and I know they all feel the same way about me too!So, check on your friends and let’s make talking about our mental health as easy as saying, “my hamstrings are tight today”. If you feel like ending your life or are unable to keep yourself safe, please call 999 or go to A&E and ask for the contact of the nearest crisis resolution team. These are teams of mental health care professionals who work with people in severe distress. If you feel affected by the content you have read, please see ourget helppage for support.

      / Challenging mental health inequalities The government has released the latest data about mental illness and treatment across the population in England. It confirms that more people than ever are struggling with their mental health - and they are not making it up.

This puts them at greater risk of developing mental health problems. Creating Connections has supported over 200 single parents throughself-management coursesandpeer support groupsin Cardiff and Newport so that they don’t have to manage alone. We at the Mental Health Foundation believe that this has been a key factor in the project's success, not just by engaging single parents to participate in activities themselves but also by empowering single parents to take the aims of self-management forward into the way they live their lives. Ensuring single parents are fully involved in Creating Connections, from the initial project concept to the evaluation of its achievements, has meant that the project has remained engaging and dynamic. It has promoted innovation and creativity. Single parents are experts in their own experience, so they know the issues and challenges for others. Many single parents involved in Creating Connections have gone on to achieve their personal goals, such as setting up their own business, going to university, learning to drive, and improving their physical health, to name just a few.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/parliamentary-review-health-and-social-care-wales,A new health policy landscape for Wales?,"Location:Wales The community and family-orientated approaches outlined in the independent review ofHealth and Social Care in Walesprovide a great sense of optimism: that individuals will stop being viewed in isolation, with a community public mental health approach underpinning the recommendations. The independent panel outlined how ""bold new models"" of care are required to meet the needs of individuals, families and communities alike, emphasisingpreventionthroughout. Each of thefour mutually-supportive goals– ""the Quadruple Aim"" – presented in the review recognise the importance of looking upstream to address the root causes of mental health challenges. Strategic, system-wide activity is necessary to take advantage of the opportunities to improve mental health at all stages of life, particularly at times when individuals, families and communities experience adversity and during times of transition from one life stage to another. If we are to rise to the challenge of reducing the prevalence of mental health problems, we will need to revise how we view mental health and where it is owned. We will need to move from a dominant mental health 'deficit' model to one which views mental health as a universal asset to be strengthened and protected. In reducing the prevalence and the distress caused by mental health problems, we recognise that to make the biggest difference. We need to start at the earliest point, focusing a good deal on child development in the early years. The delay in identifying children at risk and providing effective early intervention means that many young people enter adulthood with untreated conditions. At the same time, other symptoms may only develop once they have reached adulthood. Socio-economic disadvantages likepoverty(but also exposure to abuse and other adverse experiences) place people at greater risk of developing mental health problems.Children and young peopleliving in these circumstances are two to three times more likely to develop mental health problems. This sets the scene for a disadvantage spiral that accumulates all too often across life. When mental health problems are established, these can lead to a series of detrimental effects on people's life chances. The report's sense of urgency to achieve its vision of ""the Quadruple Aim"" presents a real opportunity to address the stark health inequalities identified across Wales. We urge the Welsh government to mirror this appetite for change and accept the recommendations from this review in full. We will detail how the recommendations will be funded and how progress will be measured to ensure they are delivered fully. 7th May 2025

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/climate-change-and-mental-health-how-look-after-your-well-being,Climate change and mental health - how to look after your well-being,"All the news about the climate crisis can have a really bad effect on your mental health. In the media or conversations, all we seem to hear is the crisis about climate change. You’re not alone with these feelings, but we at the Mental Health Foundation care about both you and your mental health. You may also be worried about the effects on other people, future generations or about the effects on yourself. Even though a lot of this feels out of our control, there are still many things that we can do to reduce the negative effects that this has on all our well-being. Our lifestyles have a profound effect on our planet. Our choices matter. Around two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions are linked to private households. The energy, food, and transport sectors each contribute about 20 per cent of lifestyle emissions. From the electricity we use to the food we eat and the way we travel, we can make a difference. As individuals, we sometimes feel that we can’t make much of a difference. But if we all do some small things to help reduce climate change, it’ll also help you feel empowered and this will have a positive effect on your own mental health. You can find lots of great information on things that you can do on theAct Nowwebsite of the United Nations. Just take a moment to think about how much information and news you are taking in and think about how it’s making you feel. If it’s having a bad effect on your well-being, then you could try these three quick wins: If you feel that climate change is affecting your community, see if you can get involved with local grassroots or community groups who are working on climate change, nature and the environment. We know that helping others is good for our mental health. If you have opinions and are passionate about climate change but are keeping silent, this may leave you feeling powerless. Try getting involved with campaigning communities that focus on climate change. For example, you could take part in a peaceful organised rally, or join relevant events or debates. Civic and political activism can help you to feel more empowered and give you an outlet for expressing your thoughts in a constructive way. If you are feeling overwhelmed, try to talk about it with someone close to you, friends, or colleagues. We know that sometimes this can feel scary or hard to do. But by taking this first brave step in sharing your feelings or asking for help, you are starting on your path to feeling better. You could start by talking with someone you trust, this could be a friend, family member, healthcare professional or helpline. Remember that Samaritans are available 24/7 for free on 116 123 (UK), and whatever you’re going through, they’re here to face it with you. It’s also worth remembering that sometimes it’s the little things that can make a big difference to how you feel. So, try to make time and space for the things, activities and actions that are good for your mental health. You could alsotry getting out into nature. We know that this really works! What works for you may be different to someone else, so tune in to what little acts of self-care make you feel better.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/how-arts-can-help-improve-your-mental-health,How arts can help improve your mental health,"This content mentions loneliness or isolation, anxiety and depression, which some people may find triggering. We are facing huge public health challenges in the UK. Mental ill-health accounts for more than 20% of these challenges, more than cancer and cardiovascular disease.1 As the number of people with long-term conditions increases, and with an ageing population who may experience high levels of physical inactivity andsocial isolation, innovative and effective treatments are needed, now more than ever!2 The arts seem to have an important role to play in this – through offering help, promoting well-being and creating a space for social connection. We’ve looked at the added value of the arts and how they can keep us happy and in good mental health. Do you recognise a feeling of joy that you can get when taking part in cultural activities such as music, museums, dance groups and theatre? Getting involved with the arts can have powerful and lasting effects on health. It can help to protect against a range of mental health conditions, help manage mental ill-health and support recovery.3 Engaging in the arts seems to be growing in popularity as a way to improve your well-being. Participating in the arts can enable people to deal with a wide range of mental ill-health conditions and psychological distress. The best part is that it helps people to improve their mental health through creativity. Making art is helping many people express themselves, without having to use words.4-5 The arts also help at a community level. As we age, we might faceisolationthrough a loss of social connections, such as friends, family and workplace - as well as other limitations such as decreasing physical health. Through getting involved in arts programmes,people in later lifecan rebuild their social connections and extend existing support in their communities. Getting in touch with others helps in alleviatingloneliness and isolation. This is also true for care homes, where arts activities can help increase social interactions between residents and staff, which can improve mood and well-being.6 More and more people now appreciate that arts and culture can play a valuable role in helping people who have mental health problems. As we’ve noted, engaging in the arts, social activities and interaction within our communities can help with major challenges, such as ageing and loneliness. It can help to boost confidence and make us feel more engaged and resilient. Besides these benefits, art engagement also alleviatesanxiety,depressionandstress. Since it can be used as a non-medical approach to preventing mental health problems, it could help save money in the health service and social care. Making art can enable people to take greater responsibility for their own health and well-being, by helping maintain levels of independence and curiosity and improve the quality of life by bringing greater joy.7 If you feel affected by the content you have read, please see ourget helppage for support. We have posted this blog that details the potential value of arts for mental health considering the new MARCH network. The MARCH Network is one of 8 new national networks funded by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), as part of the 2018 Cross-Council Mental Health Plus call to further research into mental health. The Foundation is one of the collaborating partners in this network, which is led by Dr Daisy Fancourt (University College London). One way that we support using the arts to improve mental health is through the annual Scottish Mental Health Arts Festival (SMHAF). Now one of the largest festivals of its kind in the world, SMHAF brings together communities, artists and activists from all over Scotland to be creative and engage with arts events exploring mental health, including film, theatre, literature, visual arts, dance and comedy.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/moving-self-destruct-self-care,Moving from self-destruct to self-care,"This content mentions suicide or suicidal thoughts, eating disorders, substance abuse and addiction (which may include mentions of alcohol or drug use), depression, anxiety and panic attacks. Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. Last year, we asked our Instagram followershow they recognise when they need more self-care.Some people referencedphysical symptoms(like tension headaches, spots, illness, being run down and fatigue) and others talked about mental symptoms (like not being able to concentrate or speak properly, forgetfulness,depression,anxietyand tension). I could totally relate to everything that was said, and I have learned the hard way over the years that self-care really is essential to my happiness and well-being. A younger, more naïve me was terrible at self-care and excellent at self-destruction. And I didn’t realise there was a problem with this, which was the dangerous part. Self-destruction for me in my late teens and early 20s entailed: It was all about socialising and partying. And I wasn’t happy. I was very insecure and didn’t really like or know myself. Ironically, the reason I was into excess around alcohol - or partying in general - was partly because that’s just what everyone around me did, and partly because I believed that there was a purpose to it (‘having a good time’) and that it would make me feel better. I also loved music and that went hand-in-hand with going out. I had a safe, sheltered childhood and loving parents. But, following a big move from the North to the South at an early age, a bit of bullying at school and being shy, I struggled a lot with my identity and self-esteem from a young age. I started to rebel a bit at school. I sought out naughty kids to hang out with, talked back to teachers and never really liked authority or being told what to do or how to be. I am also quite impulsive and used to get carried away with doing things I knew I shouldn’t, and then feel terrible about it later. I also found from an early age that I battled mood swings a lot. Being a perfectionist even as a child though, I wanted to excel academically, so made sure I got good grades despite emotional and behavioural difficulties. I also think when you’ve been a bit sheltered, you’re intrigued by the things everyone tells you are bad. ‘What was so wrong with takingdrugs?’ I used to think, ‘and being up all night in dodgy places?’ The thought of it was interesting to me, not frightening. When I left home, especially as the oldest child with no sibling role model to warn me and no self awareness of my emotional instability issues, I went down a bad road. I felt immune to self-care, or I hadn’t heard of it. I didn’t look unhealthy, I was a normal weight and my hair and skin were alright. I didn’t get ill much. I was able to work a job at weekends at university on no sleep. So, I used to assume that I was fine. I got by, but never really thrived in any way. I never thought about how my poor mental health was in any way related to my lifestyle. But the reality was that, as early as 16, I was going too far and couldn’t handle what I was putting in my body. I was always sick after drinking and I always had terrible patches in my memory and feelings of shame and regret the next morning. At university, my emotional instability came to a head and I was unable to control my moods or behaviour. I would often go out and start crying for no reason at all. I had no respect for myself and I often put myself at risk. I sought approval from people who didn’t care about me and looked for love in the wrong places. My health was my last priority. I was deeply unhappy, was punching walls and kicking doors with anger and frustration and hurting myself. I took myself to hospital one evening because I feltsuicidal. I would always wake up in the morning hungover and humiliated pretending to my ‘friends’ that I was fine. They, of course, were at the end of their tether with my behaviour, because they didn’t realise I was mentally unwell (or they just didn’t want to deal with it). I didn’t have the strength or stamina to cope with the lifestyle I was imposing on myself. But I was ignoring that. I think the first step towards self-care is self-awareness. An awareness of how bad things may have got for you and that this must change. There is no weakness in this; it is commendable and it is positive. Being in denial about yourself and your problems is a dangerous game. Once you’ve identified a problem, you can start to change it. So, this is what I did. I also developed ananxiety disorderin my early 20s that suddenly made me worry about literally everything to do with my health. So, strangely, it was also my anxiety that got me into self-care. One of the first things I did to feel better was to get back intoexercise, aged 23. I started to run around the local park by my house in Leytonstone for about 15 to 20 minutes at a time. I didn’t have the gear or the idea at this stage. I was getting breathless quickly and I was running in old clothes and Converse trainers, but it was a start. Running then extended to free exercise classes at the Nike store in Oxford Circus (but I credit this entirely to my friend, Lauren, who introduced these classes to me). We then signed up to a few 10k runs together. I was feeling good about my new-found love of exercise. I had a natural athletic ability at school that had been lost over years of unhealthy living and was now rearing its head again. Eventually, I signed up to my first half marathon with my mum in 2015. We ran for Mind and raised over £500. It was great and very cathartic. Running such a long distance is so challenging and the feeling you get when you achieve something like that it is truly unique. It is said that, for some people, exercise is as good at treating theirdepressionasantidepressantsare. Everyone’s experience is different, of course, but research has shown that the endorphins released through exercise lift and regulate mood and energy, and that ahealthy mind is linked to a healthy body. Nowadays, I love going to the gym a couple of times a week. Weight classes to music are so therapeutic. I also enjoy playing tennis, especially the satisfaction I get from whacking a ball across a court. I’ve done a few ballet courses as well; I find the classes allow me to take my mind off things for an hour. Another step I took towards self-care was meditation. I was very lucky that there was a trainedmindfulnesscoach working in the team where I worked, who, together with a clinical psychologist friend, began a free 8-weekmindfulness coursein my office. I went along to this at a time when myanxietywas awful and I was havingpanic attacksa lot, even at work. I had sort of reached a desperate state where I wasn’t making any progress fighting off theanxiety. I will never forget the feeling of total relief after my first propermeditationsession. It was like ecstasy, without a drug. I was completely calm and at ease with myself and my mind just seemed to go completely quiet. I remember thinking I’d love to live the rest of my life like this. I cried because I was so happy that I’d finally found something that gave me peace. And from then on, I was committed to the course and to training my mind not to auto-switch into the fight or flight response. I still believe it wasmeditationthat enabled me to break free from thepanic attackcycle. Nowadays, I try andmeditateas often as I can. I thinkmindfulnessis one of the most caring things you can do for myself. It is clinically proven to reducedepressionandanxietysymptoms and rewire the brain, which I think is incredible and can reassure people who’ve lost hope with other treatments, as I had. It also brings you into the present moment, so your life doesn’t just pass you by. I decided to make some lifestyle changes in my mid 20s. I had started to get quite bad ‘health anxiety’ anyway. I would convince myself that I had a symptom of a terminal illness frequently. I started to think about whatsmokingwas doing to my lungs andalcoholto my liver. I was worried about the impact of a party lifestyle on my brain. A lot of my anxieties were over-exaggerated and irrational (if I had a headache, it must be a brain tumour - that kind of thing), because I had ananxiety disorder, but I also recognised that if I took care of myself, the anxiety may subside. I no longer felt able to cope with old vices the same way as I had at university. I gradually became a master of moderation. When my anxiety was terrible, I had to cut out caffeine andalcoholalmost completely, because I was overly affected by stimulants and depressants. Now that myanxiety disorderhas subsided, I can drink alcohol and caffeine, but I’m careful about how much I have. I still love going out and dancing. It is wrapped up in my love of music. But I know when to stop. I don’t get so drunk that I can’t remember anything anymore. I rarelysmokenow and if I do, I tell myself it’s something I do on occasion (because I enjoy it with a drink). Most of the time though I can weigh up the benefit of having a cigarette with the drawback and convince myself, even when drunk, that the cons outweigh the pros. I’ve tried to be less impulsive. I’ve realised the importance ofeating wellas I’ve got older. When I was younger, I never thought about nutrition and how important it was to give your body good food. I judged whether I was doing okay or not based on whether I’d put on weight or not. I became a vegetarian by the age of 24, and I was diagnosed withcoeliac diseaseat 27, which came as a shock, as I had quite ‘silent’ symptoms. There is no cure for coeliac disease, and I must strictly avoid gluten for the rest of my life. As I have restrictions on my diet, it has made me even more conscious of what I eat. Mental health is really linked to gut health, as much of our serotonin is produced in the gut. I have mildIrritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)as well and I am told that this is entirely created by myanxiety. When your brain is anxious, it sends chemicals firing around the body in a fight or flight response, which affects our gut. When our gut is unhealthy, we don’t get the nutrition we need to stay well, both physically and mentally. Studies have also shown that certain vitamin deficiencies can cause mental illness. I know someone who had never had problems with his mental health and suddenly started getting bad anxiety out of nowhere. When he went to the doctor, they found that he was dangerously low in Vitamin D. Other vitamins you need to keep on top of for mental health are B vitamins, iron and magnesium. I try and makenutritionally-varied mealsnow, take vitamins and avoid too much junk food. Sleepis something else that’s so crucial to wellbeing. When I used to do all-nighters quite regularly, the combination ofalcoholand nosleepused to bring on horribleanxiety symptomsfor me. I would feel totally disassociated from reality the next day. I would feel numb and hopeless, have terrifying heart palpitations that made me feel like I was having a heart attack and would sometimes hallucinate or have night terrors. This doesn’t happen very often now after a night out, because I take better care of myself. But, for me it highlights how linked your body and mind are. So manyanxiety symptomsarephysiological, so a lack ofsleepcauses anxiety because our brains can’t function as well when we are tired and our reasoning and memory suffer. In a busy modern world, many of us take sleep for granted. I used to do this a lot. I’m a night owl and it takes me about an hour to fall asleep usually. I don’t like mornings and feel like my brain is often active at night. So, mysleep self-carenowadays usually involves going to bed at a regular time, trying to ensure I have eight hours, wearing ear plugs and removing stimulants (caffeine and screens) before bed! After making lifestyle changes, I realised that I still had more work to do toimprove my self-esteem and be kinder to myself. I realised that I had collected a lot of friends that weren’t good for me over the years – from trying to fit into crowds that I was quite different from at school or at university in order to be liked. I realised some of my friends didn’t share my values or interests and that I didn’t have a lot in common with them. I also felt that some friends scared or intimidated me and that I couldn’t be myself around them. So, I decided to be brave and break loose from people that I didn’t really like and who I felt didn’t really like me either. This is quite a momentous thing to do, and when I did it with a large group of friends, I was terrified, initially thinking I’d made a mistake, had been rash and may never find more friends. But the long-term effects of this decision have all actually been positive. I am so much happier now that I spend time with people who are more like me, friends I’ve made in workplaces that I have lots more in common with and old school friends that know me inside out and bring out the best in me. It is really freeing and liberating to be with people who bring you up and not down. You really don’t need to put yourself intoxic social situations. It’s empowering to choose who your real friends are. Having less, more genuine friends is better than more, fake friends. When my life was all about socialising, being seen and being liked, I didn’t feel that liked at all, ironically. Now that I am more secure in myself and do more of what I like, I feel like I have the best friends I’ve ever had. The same is also true ofpartners. I’ve learnt quite late on in life that I’ve unknowingly been trapped in an anxious attachment style for years: never feeling good enough for partners, always seeking their approval and subconsciously chasing people with an avoidant attachment style, who by nature do not like commitment. I have had loving, caring partners too, but as I’ve been single again for the last couple of years, I’ve watched myself be treated badly by people who in hindsight didn’t deserve me. And I’m now aware of how much more secure I have become in myself and what I look for in a partner – to prevent myself being mistreated in future. I spend a lotmore time on my ownthese days, which as an introvert with a bit ofsocial anxiety, I think is important to do. I am a sensitive, emotional person and sometimes loud, crowded or busy spaces full of people send me into a negative state of mind. Rather than always opting to go out drinking in my spare time, I now engage in hobbies that I really love. I used to feel like I wasn’t very good at anything. I played the guitar at school but never fully committed to it. I was good at art, but I never thought I’d carry on doing it after A levels. I was good at sport too but sadly quit all the teams I was in at school, because I was going through a bad patch mentally and couldn’t handle the social aspect of it. When I reached my mid 20s, I decided that I wanted to get back into hobbies. I went snowboarding and wakeboarding for the first time and loved both. I decided to get back into the guitar and properly practice, and now I’ve reached an intermediate level which is really rewarding. I also sing when I play and that is one of the best feelings in the world. I decided to put my art skills to some use and experiment with abstract painting and drawing. I’ve been learning French for the past couple of years, for the first time since GCSEs. I’ve reached Improvers level at ballet after doing a few courses. I really enjoy writing, so alongside blogging for MHF, I’ve started writing a screenplay. All these things really improve my wellbeing, but I’m careful toset realistic targets with my hobbies, as if you try and do too much, it can lead to feelings of frustration and failure if you don’t achieve what you hoped to. It’s good to get the balance right and not become too engrossed in something that it hinders other areas of your life. I know I can get carried away with painting, so I only let myself do it at weekends, as I was finding when I did it on weeknights a whole evening would go by and I wouldn’t have eaten anything. Self-care comes in lots of different forms.The steps I’ve taken to self-care have made me a better person and given my life more meaning and happiness. Looking after myself is something I don’t ever neglect anymore and something I try and prioritise when I’m feelinganxiousordepressed. I’ll stay in and have a nice bath or watch a film if I’m down, rather than forcing myself to socialise. Self-care is probably one of the most important things you can do. Without it, we often don’t have the strength to become the best versions of ourselves, and, to me, not being the best version of yourself seems like life’s most wasted opportunity.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/connection-nature-can-benefit-our-well-being,A connection to nature can benefit our well-being,"This content mentions anxiety, which some people may find triggering. Will Baldwin-Cantello (Interim Practice Leader Forest, WWF), who conceived of the 'Thriving with Nature' guide, tells you how this idea came about. The feel of warm summer sunshine or cold water. The autumn rustle of leaves under foot. The taste of winter rain. The spring smell of wild garlic. These are some of the natural sensations we might look forward to during the four seasons. Did you know experiences like these can also support your mental health? Today, I am delighted to celebrate the launch of a collaboration between WWF and the Mental Health Foundation that has been long in the making. We have worked together to produce the 'Thriving with Nature' guidebook as organisations but also as a group of individuals. You’ll see in the guide some personal stories from a few of us involved in making it. The idea of the guide stems from a personal place, too. A few years ago, I found myself, like many others, chasing mycareerwhile living in London. I wastired,stressed,anxiousand rarely took time out to slow down. We were organising a wedding, commuting on busy trains for two hours each day, paying offdebtsand living in a flat surrounded on three sides by a railway line and two main roads. Although I had much to be grateful for, I did not have the headspace to really appreciate and relish it. And then, prompted bytalking therapy, I remembered a different way. I remembered something I had studied years before: the way a connection to nature can benefit your well-being. And I remembered the trips I used to take to the Lake District, to the Scottish Highlands, Snowdonia and elsewhere. Trips I didn’t have time or money for anymore – I thought – despite the fact that I worked in the environment sector. The more I explored this, the more I realised how much was out there to enable us to accessnature for our mental health. And I found an established and growing scientific evidence base showing how big and small ‘doses’ of nature could help reducestress,anxiety, negative feelings and encourage more positive feelings. So, I got involved and set out to experience this first hand. I took part in retreats organised byChange in NatureandNatural Change. Closer to home, I heard from family members how they found gardening, wild swimming, birdwatching and trail running to help with their own all round well-being. I volunteered for theWilderness Foundation, theWildlife TrustsandAction for Conservation, and saw how their experiences in nature were helping people of all ages and backgrounds develop themselves and improve their mental and physical health. For some, that was in a small city nature reserve, for others it was in the wilds of Scotland and Wales. I also started practicingmindfulnessat this time. At first as a seated meditation focused on breathing, but increasingly I realised that nature itself provides a perfect alternative focal point. As I took solo mindful walks, I realised there was far more to be seen and heard around me than I had ever noticed before. The fourth side of our block of flats actually backed onto a narrow nature reserve along a old docklands creek feeding into the Thames. I started exploring this more closely and enjoying the wetland birds, including a grey heron that frequented this tiny, graffitied spot. And a short train ride took me into bigger open spaces. This more mindful experience in nature led me to want to write, to describe and express what I had seen. This was therapeutic in itself. I wanted to share this with others, so I started a creative writing blog and began running lunchtime mindfulness walks in the woods for colleagues. And this in turn meant people shared with me their own experiences and how it had helped them – perhaps improving their well-being on a given day specifically, or their connection to nature as part of an ongoing long-term recovery. There are a tremendous set of organisations that offer more facilitated experiences, as one-offs or more likely an ongoing programme, as mentioned in the guide. But I felt there was something else that could help: something that might nudge those of us city living folks into finding a regular connection to nature ourselves, to maintain and support all of our mental health. So, here came the guide'Thriving with Nature'. It is freely available and has been produced, as we call it, as a ‘guide for everyone’. Anyone can pick it up and use it however suits them. It holds background information, practical ideas and, we hope, some inspiration to encourage its use. But the most important parts are the blank pages there for you to reflect on and express your experiences in nature in your own way. There is no rocket science in here. For some folks, there will be familiar ground, while for others it may all be new. Either way, we all need reminding and a nudge on difficult days to get outdoors. Unfortunately, for a surprising number of us, green spaces are not readily accessible, or we have become distanced from them. If this is you, I hope you are able to find a little sanctuary nearby that you may not have noticed before, or be inspired to venture further afield on a day when you feel able to. This guide comes at a transformational time for us all. Our country is opening up slowly after the ‘lockdown’ period. Many of us have struggled with our mental health while separated from family and friends and limited in our movements. At the same time, there has been much discussion of the return of wildlife and our enjoyment of it. We now have an opportunity to start, carefully, enjoying time with loved ones again and get into the great outdoors more. I hope this guide helps you on that journey. It is important for all of us to strive for a new normal in which we can thrive with nature. WWF and the Mental Health Foundation have come together to produce a guide for you. We want you to thrive and for nature to thrive around you. We think the two are mutually supportive. Learn more about the connection between nature and mental health.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/how-nature-lifts-my-spirit,How nature lifts my spirit,"Television presenter and passionate outdoor campaignerJulia Bradburytalks to us about how nature can lift her spirit and improve her well-being, as part of ourThriving with Naturework. I’ve learned how important being outdoors in nature can be, not only for lifting my spirits but also helping me to cope with thestressesof a busy life. It’s why I believe that ‘Thriving with Nature’ will play an important role in helping people to make the most of our natural spaces through the seasons. Packed with inspiration and information, this guide will help you connect with nature throughout the year. From forest bathing to sharing nature with others as a volunteer, it’s a unique resource that brings activities together in a way that truly resonates with me. Personally, I’ve relished the benefits of walking since I was a nipper and I know there’s something quite magical about being active outdoors – come rain or sunshine! Just an hour outside is good for you on so many levels – our moods, alertness andsleep patternsare all impacted by light. For those of you thinking “I don’t have time to get to the mountains or big rugged landscapes”, a stroll in a city park, by a canal or around your local woodland can be just as reviving. And if you work in a dense urban jungle it’s still worthwhile heading outside into the light; a single tree can inspire as much joy as a ‘Big View’. You can certainly use this guide to help you discover, season by season, what is happening outdoors. I feel strongly that everyone should be able to get outdoors. It’s why I’m proud to be part of this guide and to leadThe Outdoor GuideandAccessTOGin promoting awareness of walking for well-being and access for all. I’m delighted to see the Mental Health Foundation and WWF come together, as I believe it’s vital for all of us to spend time reconnecting with nature for our mental health and well-being. I really hope that ‘Thriving with Nature’ inspires you – and your friends and family – to get out and make the most of the amazing nature all around us. Photo credited toThe Outdoor Guide.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/toni-giugliano-talks-about-pride-and-mental-health,"Pride, being gay and the effects on my mental health","This content mentions suicide or suicidal thoughts, death, discrimination or discriminatory violence (such as homophobia, racism, sexism and ableism), substance abuse and addiction (which may include mentions of alcohol or drug use), loneliness, depression, anxiety and trauma, which some people may find triggering. A blog byTony Giugliano, from the Mental Health Foundation Scotland Policy team. Pride is both a celebration of what has been achieved and a rally for the fights yet to be won – both at home and abroad. But despite civil rights advances across the world, this Pride month has been one of the most confrontational of the past 20 years, with considerable pushback from those who wish to see our rights curtailed. In Italy, where I was born, the hard right has put the brakes on long-awaited laws to stamp out homophobic and transphobic hate crimes. Their concerns won the backing of the Vatican, which last week made an unprecedented intervention calling on parts of the law to be scrapped, despite LGBT+ hate crimes in Italy soaring. Research has shown that such traumatic events putLGBT+ people at greater risk of developing a mental health problem. In Hungary, Victor Orban’s equivalent of Section 28 prompted global condemnation – including from a majority of EU countries, human rights organisations and Euro 2020 football fans. The new law will ban the display and promotion of homosexuality among under-18s, in an ideological attempt to erase LGBT+ existence from children’s lives. The damage this could cause on young LGBT+ people’s mental health is incalculable. In Guatemala, two trans activists were murdered in two separate attacks. According to Transgender Europe, at least 350 transgender people were murdered worldwide last year – a rise of 6%. Meanwhile here at home, the debate over gender recognition reform has been hijacked by fundamentalists who have portrayed trans people as dangerous predators while trying to drive a wedge between the LGBT+ community that has fought side-by-side since the Stonewall uprising of 1969. In 2019, I was lucky to be seconded to New York University as part of the Foundation’s CRISP exchange, which coincided with the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots. Vigils and symposiums marked the occasion and New York Public Library organised an exhibition where original leaflets, banners and magazines of the time were displayed. I remember being struck by the realisation that the rights I enjoy today were fought by trans women of colour. Gender and sexuality are distinct issues and the debate on GRA reform is a complex one – but the prejudice and discrimination that trans and LGB people have faced and continue to face are one and the same. Our struggles for adequate physical and mental health support, homelessness, workplace rights, acceptance in our communities – these are battles that we have fought together. The recent attacks and disinformation campaigns on reputable LGBT+ organisations like Stonewall and TIE (Time for Inclusive Education) are also concerning. I wish an organisation like TIE – which combats homophobic bullying in Scotland’s schools – had existed when I was at school. I grew up in a Catholic family in the West of Scotland, with no obvious gay role models to look up to. For years, I struggled with my sexual identity. I knew I was different – my classmates did too – and the homophobic bullying only prolonged that process of self-discovery and acceptance. Those feelings of shame led to years ofdepressionthat could have been avoided. My GP prescribed meantidepressants, which of course never worked. What I needed was to know that my feelings were normal. That some of us are attracted to the same sex and that’s okay. That I had nothing to be ashamed of. It’s not until I embarked on my Erasmus year abroad and left my immediate circle of family and friends that I finally came out. That year – filled with self-discovery and self-acceptance – remains one of the best years of my life. Just last week, Childline recorded a 10% increase in Scottish children saying they are worried about coming out. We can’t afford to repeat the mistakes of the past – which is why Hungary’s new laws and the attacks on LGBT+ organisations are chilling. More than half (55%) of young LGBT+ people experience homophobic bullying in UK schools. Andyoung peoplewho have experienced bullying are more likely to develop ananxiety disorderor suffer fromdepression. Not to mention the increased link tosuicideattempts andsubstance use. Being LGBT+ does not cause mental health problems. But environmental factors and our childhood experiences do – such as difficult coming-out experiences; unsupportive families, rejection andloneliness; bullying; homophobia, biphobia and transphobia; andstigma and discrimination. The answer lies inprevention. We need to address the root causes of trauma and create supportive environments for LGBT+ people to thrive; by supporting parents in early years, inclusive education in our schools, removing barriers in the workplace and smashingstigmain our communities. If we can achieve this, we can change lives, as well as reduce the prevalence of mental ill-health,self-harmand suicide among the LGBT+ community. Here at the Foundation, we recognise that only when inequalities are eliminated can we all have an equal chance for good mental health. That why we’ll continue to walk side-by-side with the LGBT+ community. It’s remarkable that this year, for the first time, I can finally register with my local blood donor centre to give blood, following a change in the law. It’s a win for equality – one that I will relish when l roll up my sleeve – but the fact that in 2021 all gay men were prohibited from giving blood on the basis of their sexuality shows how much work is still to be done. Orban’s Hungary and Trump’s America show that progress towards equality is fragile. In the words of Martin Luther King: “Human progress is neither automatic nor inevitable... every step toward the goal of justice requires sacrifice, suffering, and struggle.” For as long as I have to worry about being harassed while walking hand in hand with my partner, I will continue to march. For as long as gay sex is punishable by death anywhere in the world, I will continue to march. And for as long as trans people are subject to trauma through outdated gender recognition laws, I will continue to march.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/mental-health-strains-affect-athletes-well-you-and-me,"Mental health strains that affect our top-flight athletes, as well as you and me","Dr David Crepaz‑Keay and Heather Lewis talk about the mental health stresses and strains that affect our top-flight athletes, as well as you and me. Dr David Crepaz‑Keay is Head of Applied Learning at the Mental Health Foundation.Heather Lewis is Project Manager at the Foundation and Independent Elite Athlete Lifestyle Coach. Over the last couple of months, most of us will have heard several high-profile, elite athletes speaking about their mental health and their need to take some time out to prioritise it. This is a timely reminder to us that top-flight tennis players, footballers and Olympians are, above all, human and that mental health is something we all need to be aware of. ""Faster, higher, stronger"" is the English translation of the Olympian motto. Athletes are trained to relentlessly strive to be faster, higher, stronger. Sport is powerful, it’s intense, it’s all consuming. From my experience as an elite athlete lifestyle advisor, walking with athletes through the ultimate highs and lows, I would argue that the emotional, relational and mental challenges can be faster, higher and stronger too. Take the example of the elite athlete, who in a split second is crowned the world’s greatest. Every unseen moment of sacrifice is worth it just for that moment. They are catapulted into the limelight, a success! The best! They’ve gained hero status, with sponsors plastering their face across social platforms - sometimes even buildings - with financial stability and a healthy and thriving body and mind. Then, take the athlete perhaps sharing the very same track, pool, court or field, who, within that same split second, has a career-ending injury. The same moment, yet a very different outcome. Not the highs of success, accolade and celebration, but the lows of perceived failure, rehab, loss of contracts, routine, the team they saw every single day, they are removed from the team WhatsApp group. Faster, higher, stronger emotions to deal with, all because of a split second moment in time. Empathy is a powerful tool. As I have read much of what’s been circulating across our global media platforms these past few weeks, what has encouraged me the most has been the athletes who live in those shoes too, who share the pitch, track, court or pool. Fellow athletes likeMax Whitlock who praised Simone Biles for prioritising her mental health. OrJoe Root who says, “I just want my friend to be OK”. For all the faster, higher, stronger and superhuman talk (and goodness me it’s true, we are all in awe of these athletes), the highs are why they do what they do. What we should all remember is that our mental health is not superhuman. And that humanity is the one thing we all have in common. To stop, think and show empathy is truly the most powerful thing. For the athlete in the next lane, to put their arm around their fellow teammate, to acknowledge their heartache and the ultimate low. We can’t fix it, not even their fellow athletes can fix it, sometimes there’s nothing that can be said. But empathy can go a long way to supporting an athlete whilst they battle whatever emotional, mental or physical challenge, which undoubtedly is coming at them faster, higher and stronger. But it’s not undefeatable, there’s always hope. For the rest of us mere mortals,physical activityis an important part of looking after our mental health. It’s certainly a bonus that we don’t have to attend a press conference after our gym session, swim, jog or country walk, to answer some sometimes very stupid or provocative questions! If you or someone else is struggling with their mental health, or if you simply want to look after your own or someone else's mental health, there are many things that will help. Connections with other people - in or outside work - help us all to cope with life and care for our mental health. So, try to make time for your colleagues, friends, family, partner, neighbours and others in your community. And remember thatkindnessis good for our mental health, whether we're giving or receiving it. Try to be kind and thoughtful on social media - your words are powerful and will affect other human beings in ways that you may not realise. Looking after your physical health is vitally important for mental health too and, as well as exercise,eating well,drinking sensiblyand getting enough good-qualitysleepcan really help. Remember that no-one is superhuman. We all get tired and can feel overwhelmed when things don't go to plan. Try to be especially kind to yourself at these times, rather than being harsh.

In response to the Scottish Government’s petition on ending conversion therapy, the Mental Health Foundation in Scotland submitted this response: “The Mental Health Foundation supports the action called for in petition PE1817 to ban the provision or promotion of LGBT+ conversion therapy in Scotland. That is a full and effective ban on practices that demonstrate an assumption that any sexual orientation or gender identity is inherently preferable to any other, and which attempts to bring about a change of sexual orientation or gender identity and/or seeks to suppress an individual’s expression of sexual orientation identity on that basis. “There is widespread evidence available which highlights the harmful long-term effects on mental well-being associated with undergoing conversion therapy practices. Mental health professionals should be committed to reducing discrimination and social inequality, not adding to it by engaging in practices that harm LGBT+ mental health. We, therefore, oppose unethical, flawed and unfounded attempts to “cure” sexuality or gender identity.”- Toni Guigliano, Senior Policy and Public Affairs Manager If you feel affected by the content you have read, please see ourget helppage for support.

Here at the Mental Health Foundation, we are passionate about giving children and young people, as well as those around them, the skills and knowledge to protect and maintain their own mental health. ""The pandemic came with many challenges, both physically and mentally. For me, feelings of guilt arose…I was just sitting around doing nothing. I tried to direct all the time I had into my work, learning new skills, starting new projects. Sounds great, right? But then I realised that my intense need to do something gave me no time to rest and recharge."" As schools reopen for the new academic year, we’re bringing the spotlight back on the mental health and well-being of pupils and those supporting them within education. ""Whether we are in a pandemic or not, self-care still remains of high importance. Learning from this, every day I try to step away from my desk to do an activity, like walking, dancing around my room, watching a TV episode. I need to give my mind a break from everything to finally think about what I need."" - Sade Adesida, Work Experience Student at the Mental Health Foundation. TheCOVID-19 pandemic, and its widespread disruption, has affected almost all areas of personal, educational and social life forchildren and young people– especially those experiencing major life transitions, like moving from primary to secondary school or onto university and work. Now is such an important time to help children and young people to understand and protect their own mental health, as well as that of their peers. Emerging research on the effect of the pandemic shows that children and young people have consistently shown reduced levels of good mental health and well-being, with: When harnessed in the right way, schools hold huge potential for preventing mental health problems. However, an understanding of the barriers that school pupils face to good mental health is needed. The impact of thepandemichas been disproportionately greater for those who experience greater social and health inequalities, including those in care and from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, those with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) andLGBTQIA+pupils.[4-6] The pandemic and the related lockdowns have improved mental health for some – including those with pre-existing health and education needs.[7-8] However, it has been a difficult time for many young people. Research by the Mental Health Foundation and Swansea University found that in late May and early June 2021, 52% of teenagers said they had felt ‘down,depressed, irritable or hopeless’ on at least several days of the previous fortnight, while 64% said they had felt they had no one to talk to ‘some of the time’ or ‘often’.[3]​ From our Make it Count campaign in 2018, we found that: A study of British teenagers (13 to 19 years old) bythe Mental Health Foundation and academic partnershas found that 46% of teenagers said contacting friends had helped them to cope with the stress of the pandemic.[3] These figures highlight the need to improve mental health literacy and build upon existingpeer supportsystems within schools. OurPeer Education Projectis one approach to addressing the barriers to good mental health. The project is a secondary-school-based programme that trains school staff to implement the project and trains older pupils to teach younger pupils a mental health curriculum. The programme supports pupils in developing coping strategies to safeguard their mental health and recognising when to ask for help, for themselves or their peers. It is important that all members of the school community work together to promote good mental health. School communities include pupils, senior leaders and all school staff, as well as parents, caregivers and the wider community. To support schools in taking steps towards becoming mentally healthy, we have published severaldownloadable school packson mental health-related topics, which are free for schools across the UK. These packs have been co-produced with Peer Education Project school pupils and staff and include: Topics include: Body Image, Kindness, Sleep and Connecting with Nature As part of this approach, it is important to prioritise and support the mental health and well-being of school staff. “I think the perception is that when we went into lockdown, schools just went into lockdown and teachers had been doing nothing for the last nine months. It’s just been non-stop actually"" - Emily Widnall* Together with supportingchildren and young people, there is the need to prioritise the mental health and well-being of school staff. Even before the pandemic, there were clear connections between workplace stress and poor mental health within the education sector, with around half of school leaders and teachers saying that their workplace had a negative impact on their mental health and well-being.[10] During thepandemic, the levels of mental distress amongst education professionals have increased – far higher when compared to other professions – and stress levels rose from 62% in July 2020 to 84% in October 2020.[11] “…I don’t know anyone I’m talking to who isn’t really tired. I think some of that is partly around not being able to do the things that relieve your stress or give variety or things you look forward to."" - Emily Widnall* Recognising the effect the pandemic has had on school staff, and putting support in place, is an integral part of supporting children and young people’s mental health. This is why we partnered withReflect and Refocusto develop theRethinking Rest Guidespecifically to support school staff with improving the frequency and quality of their rest. “Understanding rest is the best tool we have to avoid burnout. Rest is so much more than sitting down for a few moments or that annual holiday. It is about learning how to replenish the areas of ourselves that are depleted and exhausted. By expanding our understanding of what types of rest we need and how to create that time, we will begin to reclaim our resilience and keep our fuel tank topped up.” - Ruth Hughes, Founder ofReflect and Refocus Our shared experience of the pandemic, and its effects on mental health, seem to have increased awareness of the importance of good mental health and well-being and encouraged conversations onstigma, help-seeking and self-care. By understanding the effects of the pandemic on different groups of children and young people, as well as education staff, we can better understand how to support pupils to stride forward into a more positive future. * Emily Widnall is a Senior Research Associate in Public Health at the University of Bristol and is currently researching theimpacts of COVID-19 on adolescent mental health and well-being, social connections, and social media activity, as well as understanding school staff’s experiences of lockdown and returning to school after lockdown.

Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. 2020 has been a year like no other. It has been a watershed year in terms of public health. The pandemic has challenged us as individuals, and as a nation in ways we didn’t think possible. Most of us have found new ways to cope, but we’ve also seen the pandemic make clear a truth we already knew well – that unequal life chances drives poor health and risk. It is now a matter of public knowledge that some people are more at risk of getting COVID-19 or having a more severe course of illness than others. The same is true in mental health. Our research study,Mental Health in the Pandemic, started just before lockdown, has tracked the public’s mental health throughout this year. We have found that people facing uncertainty, disadvantage, discrimination and unemployment are experiencing the most impact on their mental health. Those with pre-existing mental andphysical health conditions,young people,people from diverse racial communitiesand those who haveexperienced lossandisolationhave been some of the worst affected. Many of us have struggled with tighter restrictions in midwinter and have found it harder to cope. More of us are now facing increased financial and employment worries because of the pandemic. With news of vaccines being rolled out comes hope, but that hope must be held in gentle hands, given the long tail of social and economic consequences that could increase disparities in health further. Certainly, the mental health impact of this crisis is likely to long outlast the physical one and we must go into 2021 with that in mind. With a greater understanding of public health and a huge need for mental health to be protected and improved, there has never been a more important time to focus onprevention in mental health. As a nation, we have an opportunity to put mental health at the heart of decisions over how we recover and move forward – whether they are personal decisions, decisions in our jobs and careers or policy decisions by local and national governments. To do that, we need to really understand how central our mental health is to our lives – a reboot, built on our experiences in the pandemic, would help us all. It’s still the case that when many people think of mental health, they think of mental illness, of acute conditions that need expert help. But we all have mental health, all of the time, and it fluctuates, just like our physical health. There’s a risk that we move to describe the pain and challenges of grief, change and isolation we’ve seen in terms of mental illness, when actually, for many,what we need is a recognition that distress is part of the human condition and something we all need to recognise and respond better to. We must challenge the idea that only the ‘weak’ struggle with their mental health and that our mental health is something fixed and unchanging, like the colour of our eyes. We need to move our thinking forward from framing mental health in binary terms – good or bad, ill or well. Whether we are thinking about ourselves or others, thelanguage of mental health matters– it’s too easy to shame, judge or imply failure or inferiority. Seeing the pain, hearing people’s stories and holding distress has not been something we’ve been traditionally good at. But it’s something we’ve all done in relation to the pandemic and there are signs that this might be helping change attitudes and behaviours around mental health. Perhaps this might help us to make the progress needed to reduce the number of people who die bysuicideeach year, as suicide remains the leading killer of men under 50. As a charity chief executive sitting on government bodies, I see the system struggling to respond to the level of demand for services and being unable to pivot to provide the resources and integrated action needed for coordinated community-based preventative support. While public health budgets are cut, libraries closed, youth clubs boarded up and children’s centres closed, we are spending more on crisis care, building more prisons and more hospitals, because we haven’t marshalled the political and public commitment to invest long-term in the community assets that keep us well and healthy. This is not sustainable. Preventionin mental health means renewed and new partnerships, based on local needs, between the NHS, local government, local people and the array of charities, social enterprises, faith groups, early years activities, social and sporting clubs and community workers whose activities safeguard our mental health. Prevention also means better lives for those living with ongoing mental health problems. It isn’t either/or. Revolutionising our approach to mental health requires setting bold national targets for improving our wellbeing and placing mental health at the heart of budget setting and policy-making. If we accept that our whole lives (including our housing, access to green spaces and the quality of our communities) affect our mental health, then it becomes clear that all parts of government have a responsibility to create the conditions in which people can thrive. But it’s not just government that needs to change. We all have a role to play, taking the steps we can support our mental health, reaching out withkindnessto ourselves and in our communities. As an organisation, we have teamed up with partners to invest £2 million into preventativecommunity programmesto reach those most affected by the pandemic, to protect and improve mental health going forward. We will focus on reaching three particular groups: single parents, those from diverse racial communities and those with existing mental and physical health conditions. As we come out of one of the most difficult of years and into 2021, we want to show thatprevention in mental healthis not just urgently needed but also represents the best investment we can make for our future health.

The festive season can be a time of joy and spending time with loved ones but it can also be astressfulandlonelyperiod. During this time it is important to try to remember to look after your mental health and wellbeing. It's hard to admit that at such an exciting time of year you don't actually feel that great. But talking about your feelings can improve your mood and make it easier to deal with the tough times. It's part of taking charge or 'self managing' your mental wellbeing and doing what you can to stay healthy. It's important to create space for these conversations and also worth identifying who you can speak to if you are concerned about your well-being. What do you love doing? What activities can you lose yourself in? Enjoying yourself helps beatstress. As busy as the holiday season gets, try and keep up the activities and hobbies you enjoy all year round. You could turn these into festive activities, like making gifts, cooking mince pies or playing your musical instruments to Christmas songs! Donning a Christmas jumper can make us feel pretty special, but none of us are superhuman. At times, we all get overwhelmed by how we feel, especially when things go wrong. If things are getting too much for you in the next few weeks and you feel like you can't cope, ask for help.Samaritansare available to speak to all year round - their free helpline number is116 123and calls to this number do not appear on phone bills. When putting the finishing touches on holiday plans, we can often become distracted from the support systems around us and lose our footing.

They can offer different views from whatever's going on inside your own head, keep you grounded and help you solve practical problems - enjoy this time to catch up. If alone or away from family, theCampaign to End Lonelinessprovide some helpful resources. Some of us make people laugh, others cook fantastic meals.

It's great to catch up with friends or colleagues in the pub - spending time on good relationships is essential for good mental health - but know your limits. It's important to maintain your personal well-being too. Christmas is typically a time of overindulgence, but what weeatcan sometimes impact on how we feel. For example, too much sugar can have a noticeable effect on your mental health and well-being in the short and long term. Christmas wouldn't be Christmas without a little overindulgence but a good tip is to balance this out over the festive period - everything in moderation. It's no surprise that cold weather and short days are not the greatest motivation to get you out of bed and on a 5k run! But research shows that doingexercisereleases chemicals in your body that can make you feel good. Regular exercise can boost your self-esteem and help you to concentrate,sleepand feel better. Exercise also keeps the brain and your other vital organs healthy. So use that Christmas spirit for physical health as well as mental health - you might even enjoy the crisp air!

Find out why supportingchildren and young peopleto explore self-expression is important for their mental health and well-being. COVID-19 and the measures to control it have brought many changes to children and young people’s lives, especially to those areas which we know to be important for their mental health and well-being. With many changes likely to continue for some time, it is important children and young people are encouraged to find new ways to look after their mental health and well-being. Expressing yourself is about finding creative ways to share feelings, thoughts or ideas. This may be through painting, journaling, dancing or maybe just having a chat with a friend. There may be many ways we choose to express ourselves. It may change depending on the situation we find ourselves in and will be different to others. The most important thing is finding what works for you, in that moment, so you feel comfortable sharing your thoughts and feelings. Mental health problems, such asanxietyordepression, can happen at any age. However, for many people, childhood and young adulthood represents a particularly important time for development, well-being and mental health. Before the pandemic, research suggested that around half of mental health problems develop by the mid-teens, with three quarters established by the mid-twenties.1Mental health problems among children had been slowly rising. From our own research, we found that more than one in 10 children indicated that they have no one to talk to at school if they are feeling worried or sad, and one in two children did not ask for help because they didn’t understand what they were going through.2 These figures highlight the importance of bothearly intervention and preventionfor young people’s mental health. With prevention at the heart of our work here at the Mental Health Foundation, we believe that there is a basic level of knowledge and skill that everyone needs around their own mental health. With the pandemic continuing to impact all of us in different ways, this is even more important. For children and young people, there have been lots of changes to many areas of their lives, such as their education. This means it is important we support them to find ways to positively express how they are feeling and seek support when needed. We understand that, for children and young people, the influence of peers (friends and other role models) is incredibly important. Peer relationships form support networks where young people can comfortably express themselves. Our programmes within schools have a strong focus on creating meaningful peer relationships within school. The Peer Education Project (PEP) is a secondary school-based, educational programme. It aims to give young people the skills and knowledge they need to protect and sustain their mental health and well-being. The interactive, mental health syllabus is delivered by Peer Educators (older students) – who are trained and supported by the school staff leading the project – to Peer Learners (Year 7/8 or S1 students). The project was born out of the idea that a key source of support to young people is their peer group within the school environment, with our research showing that six out ten young people would seek support from a peer first.2 The project provides an opportunity not only to focus on mental health education and the value of peer education, but also bridges the gap between younger and older students and builds upon a mentally healthy school ethos. We learnt how to discuss mental health in a concise yet honest way, as well as being able to bridge the age gap between sixth form and lower school, which has been extremely rewarding. - Peer Educator TheBecoming a Man (BAM)programme works with young men who have been identified as needing support with social and emotional well-being. They learn about healthy behaviours within their school. BAM provides young men a space to share their thoughts, feelings and experiences with each other. They support their own and each other’s development, aided by a BAM counsellor. By communicating with each other and exploring their options in given scenarios, the BAM participants are able to reflect and develop their decision-making skills. Decision-making requires knowing what you want and need best. Making a good decision is a form of self-expression, by choosing the next best actions for yourself. I like BAM because I am learning there are different ways to become a man. I have choices. - BAM participant (year 10) Find out more about BAM It is important during this time to ensure any activities we take part in are in line with current advice from the government. Here are a few simple ways you can support a child or young person to open up and express themselves: Make time to talk openly on a regular basis. Encourage them to share how they are feeling. It may take a while before the child feels able to open up, so it is important to keep providing opportunities and show understanding, even if they don’t share anything. Good opportunities to do this can be when taking part in an activity together. For example, at home, when cooking a meal or sitting down together at mealtimes. You could plan a specific activity together, maybe join in with their favourite hobbies. This will give you time together, one-on-one, and demonstrate an interest in the ways they choose to express themselves. Sharing how you’re feeling, how you like to express yourself and how you look after your mental health and well-being are ways of setting a good example. It is important to do so in an encouraging way that doesn’t place any burden on them to follow your preferred activities. It can be hard to have conversations about how we are feeling. Children may feel embarrassed or might not want to engage in a direct conversation about their emotions. Invite and encourage children to give their thoughts and opinions, such as planning an activity for the day or deciding on what to cook for dinner. This will help reinforce that their opinions are important, and you want to listen to them. Here are eight top tips for children and young people to look after their mental health and explore ways of expressing themselves. (Taken from ourPeer Education Project) Why not listen and follow along with a relaxation exercise ormindfulnesspractice to calm your body and mind beforesleep. Journaling can be a useful way to explore your thoughts and feelings. You could try free writing, drawing, creating a collage – it's about finding what works for you! Plan a games evening with your family or a virtual catch-up with your friends. It is also important to have space just for you – watch your favourite movie or read a book. Take time to get some fresh air and explore the outdoors. Sometimes, this can give us space to work through our thoughts and feelings. Why not offer to help cook and see if there are any new recipes you like? You can also use this time to connect with the other person. Doing something for someone else. For example, help a family member with the cleaning or volunteer in the local community. Volunteering not only helps them but can make you feel good about yourself too. It can also be a chance to pause on how you are feeling until you are ready to open up. You could try a new activity or revisit one you already know. Beingphysically activecan be a great way to release our stored-up energy and emotions. It is important to spend time with those who support us. Over time, the relationship can build trust and be someone we can turn when we need. Children’s Mental Health Awareness Week is organised by Place2Be.

Following the murder of George Floyd, people all around the world recognised afresh that fundamental change was still needed across society if we are to realise a future that was more equal and equitable. That is why it was so disappointing that theSewell Reportinto race in Britain last month cast doubt on the extent of racism, rather than taking the opportunity to affirm the need for bolder action, not least because of the huge toll racism takes on people’s mental health. This blog is our story of how we, like many organisations, met to discuss, learn, share and take a long, hard look at our responsibility to address racism. We wanted to look at how we change the way that we make decisions, shape priorities and share opportunities in recognition that discrimination damages our mental health and addressing inequalities is central torealising our vision and mission.

Prior to the murder of George Floyd, we had not openly discussed this or developed a plan of how we could prevent racial disadvantage in wider society being perpetuated in our decisions and culture. Following an independent six-month review with workshops and staff consultation, we worked together to shape the actions we were going to take. Last week, our board agreed to over 70 detailed recommendations across the organisation for action. We were clear that if an issue isn’t named and seen, it isn’t a priority for action. So, we want to keep normalising the conversation about race, discrimination and inclusion. That is a process that has just started and we recognise that positive intent is not a precursor to success; as such, this needs to be nurtured, protected and monitored. There are six big commitments we are making as an organisation: As Chair and CEO, we are also joining with other leaders in the sector to take the following steps specifically in relation to speaking at panels and events or participating in committees, boards and working groups to create space for diverse voices to be heard and influence change. We want to say again that we need to keep learning. Our commitments will not end systemic racism but, as a result of these commitments, we envisage an organisation that is more reflective, more representative and more relevant. Every step on that journey will equip us to better deliver our vision of good mental health for all. If you feel affected by the content you have read, please see ourget helppage for support.

Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. This blog was written by theFeeling Our Wayproject team. 26 October to 1 November is National Care Leavers’ Awareness Week 2020. We want to take this opportunity to raise awareness of the challenges for looked-afterchildren and young peoplewho are leaving care and to show what we are doing to support care leavers. Being a young person can be hard. Being a young person in care is even harder. In the UK, there are currently around 99,000 children and young people who are looked after by a local authority, with an estimated 40,000 children and young people entering the care system this year – that’s 109 young people every day![1-4] Children and young people in care often face a lack of security, reliability and stability in their lives (which they so desperately need) due to changing foster carers, home and school placements, and earlytraumaand complications around their birth family. For example, in 2019, it was reported 63% of children in care in England were there due to abuse or neglect.[1] Many situations that lead to a child being placed in care can have lasting impacts on their mental health and emotional well-being. The Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000 states that a Care Leaver is someone who has been in the care of the Local Authority for a period of 13 weeks or more spanning their 16th birthday. In 2012, the Department of Health reported that looked-after children and care leavers were between four and five times more likely toself-harmin adulthood.[5] The transition to adulthood can be a difficult and daunting time for many young people, and this is especially so for young people leaving care. At the age of 18, many looked-after young people move into independent living – often with little emotional, financial and personal support. It is reported that within the first two years of leaving care, one third of care leavers become homeless.[6] Additionally, care leavers often find it harder to engage in education, employment or training. In 2018 and 2019, 39% of 19- to 21-year-old care leavers in England were not accessing education, employment or training opportunities.[1] Care leavers need the same care and support that other young people might expect from a parent or other family members. They need support with getting into work or moving into their own home. Above all, looked-after children need the opportunities to build their skills, knowledge and resilience to leave the care system and flourish. The Mental Health Foundation is committed to theprevention of mental health problemsacross the general population throughout a person’s life. Care leavers are an especially vulnerable group of young people, who have an increased risk of experiencing mental health difficulties and substance abuse issues. We believe it is important to support care leavers to develop the skills and resilience they need to cope as they approach an important transition period in their life, as they leave care. In partnership with Nottingham City Council, the Mental Health Foundation is delivering a project called ‘Feeling Our Way’ for care leavers in Nottingham City, to support them during this time of uncertainty with COVID-19. The project aims to reduce isolation and increase social connectedness, and to support care leavers’ in developing adaptive coping strategies. Feeling Our Way has been developed out of our previous pilot project,MyLife, MyFuture. The Mental Health Foundation aims to continue developing programmes that support the mental health and life outcomes for children in care and care leavers, in partnership with Nottingham City Council.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/reform-public-health-england-what-next,Reform of Public Health England: what next for public mental health?,"Location:England This content mentions depression, which some people may find triggering. Here we take you through our thoughts on what the reform of Public Health England means for the future of public mental health. Public health is what we build together as a society when we shape our communities so that everyone can achieve optimal health. Public health is largely understood as a modern term, but its origins can be traced to over 2,000 years ago. The ancient Greeks were the first to debate the supernatural conceptions of health and illness that had until then dominated human societies. Led by Hippocrates, they developed a new school of thought, proposing that maintaining good health and tackling illness depends on the interaction between our internal physiology, our social environments and our behaviours. In recent decades, public health as a discipline was allowed to develop and flourish through concentrated efforts to stop infectious disease outbreaks by focusing on their causes and their distribution. And as it was shown that the distribution of various illnesses was consistent across lines of geographies, wealth and race, the notion of the social determinants of health was named and strengthened. We are now clear that the conditions in which we are born, grow, live, work and age are directly influencing how illness emerges. These conditions are in turn shaped by our social and physical contexts and health services, which are further affected by the distribution of money, power and resources at global, national and local levels. These principles have been readily applied to mental health so that today we can define public mental health as the art and science of improving mental health and well-being andpreventing mental health problemsthrough the organised efforts and informed choices of society, organisations, public and private, communities and individuals. Back in 2018,we wrote to the British Medical Journalto clearly say that the window of opportunity to improve public mental health was open and called for action through coordinated health leadership,tackling of inequalities, better measurement of impact, and sustainable funding. This window of opportunity in the past few years has brought about some impressive progress. We saw a consultative and comprehensive review of the Mental Health Act, a Long Term Plan for the NHS with a clear role for prevention, a Prevention Green Paper from the Government and a wider interest in having conversations about mental health at a societal level, including the influential Royal Family. We found that ourMental Health Awareness Weekshave been bigger in reach and impact each year and that more funding than ever before was flowing towards mental health, through the Research Councils, the Wellcome Trust, the National Lottery Community Fund and others. We also saw charities and organisations working on issues of physical health stepping forward and wanting to invest more efforts and resources into the interaction between physical and mental health. Businesses, workplaces, schools and universities found a new interest in protecting the mental health of their employees and their students and whole city approaches (likeThrive LDNand Thrive West Midlands) started influencing system-wide change and investment. Last but not least, the education landscape has been changing. In the course of just a few short years, curricula of mental health studies were updated to include training inpreventionand those of public health studies were updated to include streams dedicated to mental health. Many clinical psychology and psychiatry trainees looked for placements in public health and Local Authority settings and new undergraduate, postgraduate and online courses specialising on public mental health and well-being emerged. There is a whole new generation of professionals trained in public mental health ready to go out and work in our world. This interest in mental health did not go away since the emergence of the Coronavirus pandemic.This has been the first pandemicduring which the public, politicians, professionals and researchers have also been interested in mental health. Various programmes and research have focused on understanding and addressing the impact ofthe pandemicand associated measures on mental health. The announcement by the government of the abolition of Public Health England (PHE) last month and the uncertainty around the future of some of its functions, outside of the new National Institute for Health Protection, threatens to undermine some of the incredible progress we’ve seen in recent years. The replacement of PHE with a body which focuses on infectious disease control leaves us without a clear future for PHE’s public mental health functions. In the absence of any reassurance to the contrary, we are concerned that PHE’s valuable public mental health work may be deprioritised. The focus on infectious disease control also carries the risk that professionals and the public may be led to believe that public health is only about infectious diseases. In the developed world, noncommunicable diseases, including mental health problems, make up the majority of years lived with a disability. Not only do these diseases cost the economy billions of pounds, but they also intersect with infectious diseases, potentially worsening the impact of pandemics.Depressionremains the leading cause of disability in the world. It is already clear that COVID-19 is exacerbated by a range of pre-existing conditions, including obesity and respiratory conditions, as well as other factors such as race and poverty. The direct and indirect consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic also have repercussions for the nation’s mental health, which need to be addressed as part of a recovery plan. A fully integrated model of public health, which covers communicable and noncommunicable diseases (and the social and environmental factors that interact with them) is necessary to respond to these challenges and build a healthy, prosperous and productive society. The new National Institute for Health Protection is a part of that, but it is not enough on its own. The Mental Health Foundation is a charity dedicated to theprevention of mental health problemsand the promotion of good mental health for all. At the end of last year, while the new coronavirus was emerging in China, we publishedour new strategydeclaring that we want to be a sustainable and potent force for change, positioning us as the UK mental health charity focused on prevention and good mental health. The COVID-19 pandemic has made this mission even more urgent than before. Today, we have a clear statement:it is not acceptable to lose public mental health as a key national priority, especially at this time. Public health functions are best delivered directly and effectively through regional organisations (such as Local Authorities), who have a more nuanced understanding of the needs of the populations that they serve. However, local structures are not enough to improve the population health of whole societies. A national body providing thought leadership and oversight is essential, as is a related infrastructure for data, evaluation and human resource. Thus, it is not acceptable to lose the home of the national public mental health function without a clear replacement. It is important that public mental health remains a key part of discussions about the future of public health in this country. In many ways, we were facing a mental health crisis even before the COVID-19 pandemic, and we already knew that it is not possible to treat our way out of this crisis. However, public health funding in local authorities had already seen cuts year-on-year. Alongside the new National Institute for Health Protection, the country needs a national world-class organisation dedicated to issues of population health – with a particular focus on mental health. We expect to see parity in funding and focus between physical and mental health and a national plan well integrated with local action. As part of the transition from Public Health England to the new National Institute for Health Protection, we have written to the government asking that they provide: Investment inpreventionand in addressing the social circumstances that clearly lead to mental ill-health is one of the most important tasks of any modern government because so much of a country’s potential is dependent on its citizens’ collective well-being. We are expressing our concern and our strong motivation for retaining a national public mental health function for the sake of the well-being of the people of this country.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/removing-hierarchies-future-systematic-review,Removing hierarchies and working across professions – is this the future of the systematic review?,"How one partnership working model has made researchers think again. OurResearch teamhas been working on a rapid systematic review of the impact of the determinants of inequality on mental health during theCOVID-19 outbreakand other coronavirus outbreaks. This project, which looks to assess evidence from existing studies and draw conclusions in a short period of time, has been carried out using a novel partnership working approach. Chiara Lombardo (Senior Research Officer) and Lauren Weeks (Research Assistant) from the Mental Health Foundation formed the core team, along withNoortje Uphoff(Research Fellow, Cochrane Common Mental Disorders, University of York) and Gordon Johnston (Independent Peer Researcher). The four lead researchers brought a range of experiences and skills to the project. Cochrane systematic reviews look at published evidence in health care and health care policy. They are usually carried out by university and clinical researchers and follow a formal process. This always begins with writing and registering a detailed protocol: which databases will be searched, what criteria will be used to include or exclude individual studies, what outcomes will be considered? The protocol is then followed exactly, acting as a roadmap for the review. A protocol was developed and registered before the research work could begin. From the start, the core project team met weekly. This was vital in allocating and coordinating work, reviewing progress and meeting a tight timescale. The project was carried out under COVID-19 restrictions, meaning team members could not meet in person. All work was done remotely, and so these online meetings were vital. “I’d used Covidence (software to support systematic reviews) before this project completing a less rigorous review. However, this project really honed my Covidence skills and taught me how to conduct a systematic review from start to finish. You gain a real sense of achievement going through the motions of a review, which I found enjoyable.” - Lauren Weeks (Research Assistant) Team meetings were also a key forum for learning. Noortje was the only team member to have worked on a rapid systematic review before, so others initially relied on her expertise in the methodology and of the Covidence online system used for managing reviews. As progress was made, all researchers learned new skills and developed a strong sense of shared responsibility for the project. “We all contributed equally to the work, learning as we went. At each step, we divided tasks up based on skills and time available to make sure we stayed on track.” - Gordon Johnston (Independent Peer Researcher) Gordon and Chiara held regular feedback meetings, to revisit the workplan, address any training needs and discuss feasible way in which we could have improved our working together. The direction of the project was adjusted according to our abilities and knowledge. “Lauren and I had sketched together a job description for Gordon and training slides to support our journey. We were constantly reviewing our progress, and - given the different skill sets - making sure no one was feeling left behind or not involved. I have always felt safe to ask any questions, and I felt gently prompted to go beyond the pure research results to see the practical implications into everyday life” - Chiara Lombardo (Senior Research Officer) The process of selecting the included reviews involved several steps. Firstly, databases were searched by Sarah Dawson, a Cochrane information specialist, with over 700 records found. All were screened by team members, with 55 of these then read in full and 25 from around the world finally selected. This involved a lot of work and detailed discussion where there was disagreement or questions over inclusion. Team working was particularly important in this period, to ensure consistency of approach. “Everyone in the team contributed to all stages of the review process. The peer researcher brought a different perspective and his involvement in the design of the study and writing of the protocol has made me feel confident that the review asks questions which are important to the public. He also helped to make sure that findings were written up in a way that fairly and adequately reflects the evidence we found.” - Noortje Uphoff (Research Fellow, Cochrane Common Mental Disorders, University of York) The key data was then extracted from these 25 studies and detailed discussions took place among the team to synthesise the results and draw common conclusions. This was where differing experiences and a variety of viewpoints allowed a detailed analysis to take place. As many of the results related to those working in healthcare systems, a focus group of healthcare workers from a variety of roles and settings was assembled as an additional stage to enrich our understanding. This approach is more commonly used in the third sector and Chiara and Lauren’s experience of running similar sessions was very important. The key results were presented to the panel and their views sought on how the outcomes reflected their experiences. This gave a far greater understanding of, for example, whether findings from the Chinese experience of the pandemic were relevant to the UK. “Running the focus groups gave new meaning to the data. We could add a narrative and contextualise the research articles we read to the day-to-day life of those who had faced challenges in their jobs due to COVID-19.” - Chiara Lombardo (Senior Research Officer) A final academic paper has been published and a Foundation policy briefing is being prepared with points that we want others to take action on. All of the core members of the team found this a very interesting process, particularly given their different backgrounds and experiences. It is clear that, unsurprisingly, partnership working had great benefits and strengthened the final outcomes. “As a researcher working at a university, I usually conduct systematic reviews with other academics and clinicians. I believe working in collaboration with mental health charities, peer researchers and stakeholders, as we did in this project, greatly benefits the research.” - Noortje Uphoff (Research Fellow, Cochrane Common Mental Disorders, University of York) Lauren spoke of what she learnt from working in this partnership way: “I learned to do more rigorous elements of a review. But I think one of the main take home messages for me was the importance of including lived experience in research and including a variety of perspectives. I have always thought it important to have a lived experience voice present in research, yet seeing it first-hand really solidified this belief. It also makes you think of how important it is to include a variety of perspectives and to always try and get a diverse range of people working on a project. “For example, it was great that we had a peer researcher, academic research and third-sector, public mental health researchers, yet it would have been great to think next time of thinking more broadly, such as around race, sexuality, gender and socio-economic background, to strengthen the variety of perspectives thought about when completing the review.” - Lauren Weeks (Research Assistant) “I echoed Lauren saying that I have learnt a more rigorous approach, but I also like to quote Gordon who would often say we want to produce research that doesn’t conclude saying ‘that more research is needed to reach our conclusions’!” - Chiara Lombardo (Senior Research Officer) We have produced a piece of research with clear conclusions and clear policy implications, and I think that our approach has played an important role to reach that. This project has shown that research methods can be improved by partnership working, bringing different skills and experiences together. Academic, third sector and peer researchers worked well together here, forming a close team and finishing the project on time. Lauren concluded on what the highlights of the project were to her: “I really enjoyed working in this team. I think the fact that it was three different disciplines coming together is what made it so enjoyable. There was an abundance of different viewpoints, perspectives and expertise and this added not only richness to the project but also to each other as individuals. It felt more lively, flexible and dynamic than a usual review, as whilst we still followed the rigorous steps, there was more free-flowing conversation and discussion about what was important. “Due to the variety of different perspectives and expertise, ideas that one may not have thought of as important would be flagged and discussed and it would broaden not only the depth of the paper but also your own understanding as a researcher.” - Lauren Weeks (Research Assistant) Noortje concluded: “As a result of this collaboration between our organisations, our research findings are more relevant and meaningful to policy-makers and the public and are, therefore, more likely to lead to a positive impact on people's mental health and wellbeing.” - Noortje Uphoff (Research Fellow, Cochrane Common Mental Disorders, University of York) The partnership approach has resulted in a detailed research study that has academic rigour, plus additional benefits from input beyond a traditional academic view. Perhaps we should call this a 'Systematic Review Plus'. Our Rapid Systematic Review has now been published 12th Aug 2025

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/what-does-blue-monday-mean-our-mental-health,What does Blue Monday mean for our mental health?,"This content mentions depression and anxiety, which some people may find triggering. January’s third Monday, “Blue Monday”, is thought to be the most depressing day of the year. Spoiler: it isn’t. Let’s look after our mental health against commercial influences. Blue Monday is a PR stunt that was originally dreamed up to sell holidays. It is a myth, a false calculation based on things like the gloomy weather, post-Christmas debt, disappointment from not keepingNew Year’s resolutions, dissatisfaction about going back to work and general doom and gloom. Since then, it has become a rather tedious yearly PR event, often designed to promote things that are vaguely linked to improving our well-being, more often than not with a complete lack of evidence. No actual scientific studies have ever backed up any claims about Blue Monday. It is pointless to try and identify what the most depressing day of the year is because it would be different for each one of us. As different as each person’s circumstances are. And it is also important to distinguish between temporarily feeling down, which we all relate to from time to time, and experiencingdepressionor a mental health problem that can be quite disabling for our day-to-day lives. This year, perhaps more than any other year in recent memory, the need and importance for us all to look after our mental health and support each other at this time, is clear and urgent. Thecoronavirus pandemichas eroded many of the things that normally protect our mental health – from social connectedness to financial security and hope for the future. However, despite the fact that Blue Monday isn’t real, there can be seasonal variations in our mental health. Some people might be experiencingSeasonal Affective Disorderwith symptoms ofdepressionthat come and go in a seasonal pattern (and are usually more intense in the months with lower daylight). Bodily changes in the winter can affect our hormones and impact oursleepingandeating habits, as well as our mood. Things that are known to be good for our mental health, such asexercisingandspending time in green and blue spaces, are harder to do when the days are short and nights are long. December is also a time when some of us may tend to eat anddrink too much, run updebts, and then sometimes feel bad about these afterwards. Perhaps the true meaning of Blue Monday is that we all have mental health and that there are steps that we can take on every day of the year to try and protect it.We should not just be thinking about our mental health on 18th January this year, but on every day of the year.Depressionand other mental health problems last for more than a day. And mental health problems can affect people in different ways on any day of the year. Poor mental health is the greatest public health challenge facing our generation. Trivialising symptoms ofdepression,anxietyand other mental health problems, under the influence of commercial industries that wish to turn mental health into an on-trend topic for profit, is unacceptable.Our approach should be evidence-based, involve whole communities and prioritiseprevention.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/what-next-future-health-security-uk,What next for the future of health security in the UK?,"This content mentions death or bereavement, which some people may find triggering. The Mental Health Foundation responds to today’s proposals for the new UK Health Security Agency. Whatever the intent, the proposal announced today for the future of Health Security in England will result in a more fragmented system. We are losing a single national public health body (Public Health England) that currently provides a clear, integrated and cohesive focus on health improvement and, within this, public mental health. While the new UK Health Security Agency has a broad public health remit, its predominant focus is on infectious disease control, not creating the conditions and supporting the action needed in our communities to enable people to enjoy good overall health. It is, of course, vital that the UK is in a good position to respond to pandemic threats. However, in public health terms, health security is a holistic term: the protection from threats to our health. Considering that not all pandemics can be prevented, it is also vital, then, that the country is able to respond effectively to the threats that pandemics pose to the overall health of our country’s citizens and the fabric of our society, including their mental health. Health security is understood in both a collective way (reducing the vulnerability of communities to harmed health) and an individual way (access to safe and effective products, services and technologies). If this past year has taught us anything, it is that an effective response to pandemics also means holistically addressing the risks to people’s mental health, supporting those who are most vulnerable and tackling those persistent inequalities that cause many communities to have very different health experiences to others. The devastatingloss of life, months ofsocial isolationand widespread financial instability we have seen over the last year because ofCOVID-19has brought despair to individuals, families and communities. Before the crisis, many people in our society with mental health problems were already struggling to access the basic support needed to stay well. With hundreds of thousands more people likely to experience mental health problems as a result of the pandemic, continuing withbusiness as usual is now not an option. The creation of this new agency – the announcement of which contains no reference to the mental health effects of the infectious disease pandemics – is far from being the whole of the change we need to see. People’s experiences during this time do not have to lead to mental health problems in the future if we have a comprehensive plan to deal with the aftermath of the pandemic. In addition to the human cost of mental ill-health, there arecompelling economic reasonsto ensure that, as we return to living our lives as we used to, we are all able to thrive and play a full part in the national recovery. We are still awaiting the government's cross-government mental health recovery plan and would like to see this published as soon as possible.The government needs to be clear about what its ambitions are, how they will be measured and who will be held to account for their delivery. The government has today signalled that it will soon be publishing its proposals for the future of national health promotion and health improvement functions, and we will be scrutinising these carefully to see what they mean for public mental health. It is vital that all parts of the new system are fully accountable for working well together and that public mental health remains a strategic and cross-cutting priority, as it currently is for Public Health England.

If we have challenges aroundfood and eating, a change in the type or pattern of eating and shopping can jeopardise ourrecoveryor upset techniques we have learned to keep well. The public health messages and media commentary on the pandemic can be triggering for people who experience obsessions or intrusive thoughts relating to contamination or spreading disease. Simple, repeated slogans are needed to persuade people to follow lockdown rules, but phrases like ‘stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives’ can have a huge impact, if our distress has always made us believe we should take action to protect others from contagions we believe we might spread. If we have been detained in hospital or have isolated ourselves in our homes in the past, the need to stay home now can remind us of those times. The media focus on people supposedly breaking government guidance, and the actions of the police enforcing it, might make some us feel more watched or exposed. This may be exacerbated if we’ve had contact with the police or the Criminal Justice System, or if we’ve had similar experiences whilst detained in hospital.Hearing Voices Network developed an excellent resourceon surviving the pandemic, for people who have visons or hear voices. If we have experiencedtrauma, then our flashbacks may be stronger and more frequent and some of our coping strategies may no longer be available. Similarly, if we struggle withself-harmor substance misuse, it can be hard to resist urges. We may feel that A&E is no longer an option for emergency treatment – though it is. We may be worried about the risks of abrupt withdrawal fromdrugsoralcohol. We may not be able to access our usual support network, see friends or go to our peer support/self-help group. It may be that home is not a safe place. We may also be worried about accessingmedication. There are some people who prefer face-to-face and they might struggle more at the moment, because this is far less available. There have been confusing messages in the media about this, and about who ‘deserves’ care. We might understandably be worried that A&E and emergency services may not be available, if things reach crisis point. It’s also a confusing time, because some of us might be coping better than anticipated. We may feel comfortable in ‘crisis mode’ or be used to being isolated or getting limited support, so the pandemic doesn’t feel too different. If you are feeling like ending your life or feel unable to keep yourself safe, please call 999 or go to A&E and ask for the contact of the nearest crisis resolution team.

There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. Angeris a universal human emotion that can be seen in the facial expressions of infants as young as six months.[1] Despite this, anger is frequently misunderstood. While often perceived as an extremely negative emotion, anger has evolved as an emotion to be a natural response to challenges or threats. There is nothing wrong with experiencing anger; it is part of being human. It can, however, be managed in both healthy and unhealthy ways. The way we understand and manage anger is important to our mental health, which is in turn an important regulator for our feelings of anger. Anger is sometimes referred to as a secondary emotion – in other words, feelings of anger may mask other underlying emotions like fear or sadness.[2] Some research indicates that ‘acting out’ through anger and irritability may be how some men cope withdepression, especially when connected to emotions of stress or shame.[3-5] Though this may be challenging for their loved ones, expressions of anger are often neglected as a symptom associated with depression and may lead to some of these men being overlooked or misdiagnosed.[6] Understanding anger better is vital to provide a fuller picture ofmen’s mental health. The way men experience and express anger may be informed, in part, by societal expectations – that is, the ways in which men have been traditionally expected to behave. These traditional notions of masculinity tend to favour strength, stoicism, dominance and control. Though these are not inherently negative traits, rigidly adhering to them could result in a negative impact onmen’s mental healthand often means that men are more reluctant to express concerns about their mental health and access to services.[7-11] Men may also be more likely to deny that they have a mental health problem in a display of ‘stoicism’.[3] As a result, men may be less likely than women to seek help from mental health professionals.[12] As these traditional behaviours are very much linked to our culture, parents and teachers have an important role to play when supporting boys growing up. Identifying the causes behind behaviours among boys perceived as problematic may go a long way towards nurturing healthy adult men. Anger is a natural emotion and is an acceptable feeling and response to situations that threaten our survival or psychological integrity. It is healthy to express your angry feelings in an assertive, respectful way and, in certain situations, anger may be the most appropriate response.[13] Given that anger is a socially acceptable emotion for men, and there is a lot of social reinforcement for being angry, it is important not to be critical of anger but rather to try to understand the message that underlies it. It is also a good idea to find ways to channel this energy positively to ensure that it does not have a destructive impact on yourself or others, for instance, through increased aggression. Such productive ways of channelling anger could include taking part in high-intensity sports, such as swimming, martial arts or basketball, or engaging in the arts. We need to better understand and be more aware that anger may be a sign of an underlying mental health problem. There is a lot at stake. Population-level data demonstrate that men’s mental health should be a top priority, with men in the UK being three times more likely than women to completesuicideand 72% of male prisoners experiencing two or more mental health problems.[14-15] Men are also more likely to be a victim of violent crime than women (2.4% of males versus 1.3% of females), and may subsequently experience anger as an emotional reaction to their experience.[16] A report by the Men’s Mental Health Forum provided a wealth of advice on how to encourage men to engage in mental health services, including the importance of using ‘male-friendly’ language and providing a personal approach.[15] On a broader, societal level, the report indicated that the media have a responsibility to highlight positive stories about men with mental health problems that focus onrecoveryand hope. The setting of services is also important to consider, with safe, ‘male-friendly’ spaces, perhaps embedded in the community, having the potential toreduce mental health stigma and tackle discrimination.[17] Men’s mental health services also need to take into account the type of intervention, with activity or ‘action‐oriented’ approaches as preferred ways to engage and sustain men’s involvement.[15] Direct, solution-focused approaches may be better suited for men and prevent them from feeling as though they are surrendering their masculine identity. And we all have a responsibility to deal in a more holistic way with these issues of masculine identity and what it means in our cultures.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/psychologically-informed-support-homeless-people-what-it-means-and-why-its-crucial,Psychologically informed support for homeless people: what it means and why it’s crucial,"This content mentions anxiety and trauma, which some people may find triggering. Mental health problems affect large numbers of homeless people and those who were homeless and now live in supported housing. Neglect, abuse and the ongoing impact of traumatic experiences in childhood are all factors which lead to this higher risk of mental ill health. The complex traumas people have experienced, and how they may be expressed, often make accessing and staying engaged with services especially difficult. In spite of the complexity of the problems people face, services that adopt a psychologically informed approach can enable people to move on and thrive in life. Psychologically informed environments (PIEs) are services where the day-to-day running has been designed to take the psychological and emotional needs of people with these experiences into account. The approach has been developed in recognition of how crucial it is that services do all they can to create environments that aid and do not hinder in people's recovery, understanding what they may have experienced and how this could impact how they relate to services. There is no structure set in stone, or specific recommended policy that defines a psychologically informed environment. Rather, PIE is a mode of working that places people and their individual needs at the centre. This translates meaningfully into the day-to-day running of the service. The social environment created is one that enables and sustains recovery. A person comes into contact with a homelessness outreach service having experienced childhood trauma. In this uninformed environment, none of the staff or volunteers are aware of the consequences or effects that trauma could have had on this person. The trauma could be unintentionally reinforced and continued. The person is misread as reluctant to receive help or engage with the service because of their extreme social anxiety (a result of the trauma they have experienced). The signs of trauma go unnoticed and the person's experiences go unaddressed for too long, making the effects more difficult to treat in the future. There is no single formula to making a PIE work; different approaches can be applied to suit individuals. However, there are some core elements to consider, such as staff training, the design of a service and reflective practice. A good marker of whether a service operates in a psychologically informed way or not is how staff articulate how their service is run and why: ""For the moment, at least, the definitive marker of a PIE is simply that, if asked why the unit is run in such and such a way, the staff would give an answer in terms of the emotional and psychological needs of service users, rather than giving some more logistical or practical rationale."" (Johnson & Haigh, 2010) There’s a growing awareness of trauma and resulting mental health problems in the homelessness sector and, with it, a demand for better understanding of how services can improve the psychological well-being of the people they support. That’s why it’s essential that we build a movement based around the PIE concept. I’m delighted to be chairing Homeless Link’s event to advance understanding of the need for psychologically informed support for people experiencing homelessness and those living in supported housing. By marrying practice and research together at this conference, we can showcase practice that is backed up by evidence and develop the research agenda further, informed by practice. We can begin to build services that fully understand the challenges facing them and continue to develop and transform the way these services are delivered.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/screen-time-and-childrens-mental-health-what-does-evidence-say,Screen time and children's mental health: what does the evidence say?,"This content mentions anxiety and depression, which some people may find triggering. A row has erupted recently over the World Health Organization's recognition of 'gaming disorder' in the 11th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD11). Some have questioned the WHO’s decision to include the condition in the ICD11, saying there is little evidence that screen time affects children, but theWHOsays its inclusion is “based on reviews of available evidence”. While the debate around 'gaming disorder' concerns the effects of video game use in particular, there is also a debate about the wider effects of screen time on children and young people. So, what does the evidence say? The use of screens has become nearly inescapable in our daily lives. Screens are now the medium through which we access entertainment, communicate with others, socialise, and shop. This includes the use of screens by children and young people, with one recent study finding that 99.9% of a large sample of English 15-year olds use at least one kind of digital technology every day.1 As the presence of technology in the lives of children and young people has increased so, too, has an interest in how these screen-based technologies impact on their health and well-being, and how best to manage and moderate their use. Several professional bodies have released recommendations for the use of screens and digital media by children and young people. TheBritish Psychological Societyrecommends that parents and carers use technology alongside children and engage them in discussions about media use.2 The American Academy of Pediatrics recommend less than one to two hours of entertainment screen time per day for children and discourage the use of any screen media by children under two years of age.3 Many of the concerns around screen use relate to sedentary (or inactive) behaviour. The idea is that time spent in front of a screen is time that is not spent exercising or doing other forms of physical activity. Sedentary behaviour may be associated with poorer physical health, well-being, and mental health4and some research has connected screen use to increased sedentary behaviour in children.5 There are also concerns that the use of screens can impact children and young people's sleep, something that is important to both physical and mental health and well-being. Indeed, there is evidence to suggest that the use of screens at bedtime is linked to children having fewer hours of sleep, poorer sleep quality, and increased tiredness.6,7 In terms of the relationship between screen use and physical and mental health outcomes, there have been several studies that suggest higher levels of screen use in children and adolescents is associated with reduced physical activity, increased risk of depression, and lower well-being.5, 8-10 There are other studies that find no differences in well-being or mental health problems between children who meet recommended screen use guidelines, and those that exceed them.1,11-12Some studies suggest there may actually be small, positive impacts of screen use on children and young people.1,11,13 This shifting relationship has been suggested by some researchers to be a result of screen use having a 'U-shaped' relationship to health and well-being, where using screens for low to moderate amounts of time can have neutral to positive effects but using screens for an excessive amount of time may begin to have negative effects.1,8,11,14 Some of the confusion around the effects of screen use in children may also be due to how quickly technology has developed. There are now many different types of screens (televisions, computers, tablets, mobile phones) which can be used in many different ways (watching films, playing games, reading books, using social media). This means when we talk about 'screen use' in children and young people, we can be talking about a huge range of activities, each of which may have a unique impact. Using screens for communicating and connecting with friends and loved ones may be beneficial for some children and young people. There is research to suggest that, while social media has risks in the form of enabling unhealthy comparisons to others, bullying, or exposure to negative content, it can also have positive influences. Children have reported feeling that it helps them to keep in touch with others, strengthen relationships with friends, and allows them to explore new information and perspectives.13,15 A review of the research around Facebook use found that 'passive use' (scrolling through posts without interacting with the content) was associated with lower well-being and life satisfaction, but 'active use', where Facebook was used to directly communicate with others, or create content, was not associated with these negative effects, and may actually have a slight positive impact on well-being and perceptions of social support over time.16 This suggests that how children interact with media, as well as the type of media they use, and how long they use it for, may all influence mental health and well-being in slightly different ways. Screens can also be used to actively promote mental health in the form of computerised therapies. For example, computerisedcognitive behavioural therapy(cCBT), has been found to be effective for children and young people aged 12 to 25 who are at risk of, or are experiencing,anxietyanddepression.17 It is important to note that a great many of the studies that look at screen use in children and young people are cross-sectional, meaning they look at the characteristics of a group at a single point in time. This can make it difficult to draw firm conclusions about whether screen use causes certain outcomes, or if children who are more likely to use screens frequently, are also more likely to experience various physical and psychological outcomes because of another common factor. Ultimately, there is still much more to learn about how the use of screens and technology impact on the mental health and well-being of children, and as our technology develops, so too will our understanding of the many ways, both good and bad, that it can impact on our lives.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/social-media-and-young-peoples-mental-health,Social media and young people's mental health,"This content mentions depression, which some people may find triggering. In this blog, Brayan Herrera, a year 12 student who has been on placement with Mental Health Foundations Policy and Research team from Haggerston School, East London, as part of the Inspire Initiative, discusses the positive and negative impacts of social media on young people's mental health. Social media has dramatically changed the way we communicate. We no longer need to wait for newspaper updates, but rather learn from those on our social media feeds about the issues that are most important or appealing to us. Even more importantly, social media has proven its power in motivating people to action as well as a strong resource to influence social, political and economic policies. Social media is a powerful tool for young people; it provides a platform for our voices to be heard and enables us to become active citizens and to voice our opinions on the matters that affect or interest us. It also has the power to bring together voices of concern about particular issues – for example when Rachel Beckwith’s birthday wish came true and she was able to raise $1,265,823 to help young children in Africa to have clean water:she was able to raise awareness and convince people to donate to the charity. This shows the real benefits of social media as it allowed the distribution of an idea that was then recognised by new audiences that might otherwise have missed out. Social media, as well as the internet more broadly, has helped young people to explore new ideas as well as to build resilience as they learn to recognise and manage risks. While social media can offer many benefits to society, and to young people more specifically, it can be argued that it has also transformed our culture into one of over-sharing. We should ask the question, what impact does this have on our mental health? Nowadays, we only look at how many pictures we can post or what is the next thing we should post but we don’t look at the effect of social media on our mental health. Taking Facebook and Instagram as examples, they allow us to present our own filtered sense of reality, showing only what we want to show. This can lead to a person critically comparing their life with other people's and using others' posts as measures for successes and failures in their own life. The impact of this could be catastrophic feelings of low self-esteem, resulting in negative 'I am' statements, such as 'I will never be able to be like that person', or 'I could never do that'. Low self-esteem is not the only result of the high level of social media use. There has also been a study conducted by psychologist Dr Paula Durlofsky, which was done with the aim of digging into how to establish a healthy balance between real-time relationships and virtual connections. This study demonstrated a correlation between social media use anddepression. Body dysmorphia is another area, which has been affected by social media. A study conducted by Dr Bryony Bamford indicated that high amounts of time spent on Facebook may lead to body image insecurity, which can also lead todepression. So are you being adversely affected by social media? Here are some signs to look out for: If you think your mental health is being affected by social media, below are three examples of the available support. Ditch the Labelis one of the largest and most ambitious anti-bullying charities, which provides innovative support (emotional, psychological and physical) to those who have been affected by bullying through digital and non-digital environment. In addition to this, the website offers world-class pioneering research to keep up to date with the landscape of bullying and tackles wider societal issues that stem from discrimination and prejudice. Aye Mindis a leading UK mental health charity that campaigns for local and national improvements to mental health.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/new-strategy-new-opportunity-protect-scotlands-mental-health,"A new strategy, a new opportunity to protect Scotland’s mental health","Location:Scotland This content mentions depression and anxiety, which some people may find triggering. In the context of a once in a generation cost-of-living crisis alongside the lingering effects of the COVID pandemic, Scotland’s mental health has perhaps never been as at risk as it is today. Already in May of this year, in a UK representative poll carried out by the Money and Mental Health Institute, six in ten (59%) UK adults said that the cost-of-living crisis has had a negative impact on their mental health, such as feelinganxious,depressedor hopeless. Mental health problems cost the Scottish economy £8.8 billion in 2019, even before the pandemic hit. Much of these costs are preventable by investing in policies and programmes that address the root causes of poor mental health, particularly poverty. We cannot afford to sit on the side lines and watch the impending mental health crisis develop. As the Scottish Government prepares a new Mental Health and Wellbeing Strategy, we have a fresh opportunity to protect our nation’s mental health and well-being in the context of these national challenges and to draft a truly whole-of-government Strategy. Our mental health is shaped by our environments and experiences. This includes things that we may have little control over such as job security, housing, how much money we have, and the facilities and services available to us in our communities. We need our governments and local authorities to take action to give people the best opportunity to thrive and live mentally healthy lives. For too long the approach to mental health in Scotland has been focused on mental health services and treatments. Of course, if people are experiencing poor mental health, they must have quick access to the right treatment. However, we cannot treat our way out of the mental health crisis. We are already seeing waiting lists of months and years for services that cannot meet the demand. We must do more toprevent mental health problemsarising in the first place, support people to live well, and reduce the need for specialist mental health support and crisis care. Recently I attended a meeting with theDiverse Experiences Advisory Panel, a newly established mental health advisory group to the Scottish Government that is hosted by the Mental Health Foundation. Its members, drawn from a range of communities and groups experiencing mental health inequity, discrimination and/or social exclusion, shared their views on what would most help their mental health. What they said was that many of the things most important to their mental health are outside of health service provision. Things like being able to make choices for one’s life, having liberty and feeling safe, having enough money and not having to worry about it, and having clean, well-lit living space. That’s why, inour response to the public consultation on the new Mental Health and Wellbeing Strategy, we’re urging Scottish Government to focus on prevention of poor mental health, empowering people to live well with additional support for people who are at increased risk. We have included recommendations across all policy areas from education and employment to justice and transport. The Scottish Government has already outlined its vision for an economy which prioritises the well-being of current and future generations. If the government is serious about achieving this vision, they need to demonstrate that commitment in visible action by establishing a Mental Health in All Policies Forum with representation and accountability for every government department, to share best practice and track progress towards the vision. We all know that the coming weeks, months, and years are going to hit people’s finances hard, leading to increased mental distress. The entire Scottish Government must do all it can to alleviate the harmful mental health impact of soaring inflation and prevent a catastrophic mental health crisis.

There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. As thousands of 18 year olds in the UK have begun, or are about to begin, their university experience, starting with the infamous ‘freshers’ week, now is an opportune moment to discuss the mental health crisis in universities. Why are university students of particular concern? Given that the majority of mental health problems develop by the age of 241, university students are a group at high risk of having mental health problems. Starting university is amajor life transition2, and can be both exciting and overwhelming. Not only must students manage multiple academic and social pressures, they must also navigate developmental challenges as they transition to adulthood.3 Students today are faced with unique concerns compared to students in the past. This includes thestressof unprecedentedfinancial burdenfrom student loans and increased tuition fees, and the potentially negative consequences on wellbeing of the use of digital technologies andsocial media.4,5 Recent statistics reveal the extent of the student mental health crisis in the UK. In 2015 and 2016, over 15,000 first-year students in UK universities reported that they had a mental health problem, compared to approximately 3,000 in 2006.6 This increase in disclosure is mirrored by a 94% of higher education institutions reporting an increase in demand for theircounselling services.6Despite the surge in help-seeking behaviour, there is evidence to suggest that there are many more students who do not seek treatment for mental health problems.3 There are a range of implications of worsening mental health among students. Poor mental health has been associated with poorer academic outcomes7, as students tend to be less able to effectively manage stress and pressure and, thus, their ability to perform given tasks productively is diminished.8 They may also be more likely to drop out of university: statistics highlight a 210% increase in university dropouts among students with mental health problems from 2009 and 2010 to 2014 and 2015.6Of even greater concern is that studentsuicideshave increased by 79% from 2007 (75) to 2015 (134).6 Indeed, student mental health is being pushed higher up the government’s agenda. In June of this year, universities minister Sam Gyimah announced a new package of measures, including a University Mental Health Charter and a working group to support students transitioning from school into university.9 While this package is promising and reflects a wider commitment to improve student mental health, a more proactive approach needs to be taken at government and NHS level, and at the university and higher education level.6 This includes universities adopting a whole-university approach to student mental health, which should be informed by best practice. Universities and higher education institutions should seek to implement currently available programmes to strengthen the current evidence base and identify what refinements are required. Through improving and strengthening this research base, evidence-based investment decisions regarding mental health provision in universities can be made.3,10 Addressing mental health in students can have a positive effect on mental health in later life. By ensuring student mental health is treated as a societal concern, we can encourageearly interventionand action. By intervening early, at a critical transition point in young people’s lives, we can avoid the long-term risks associated with poor mental health, which can have far-reaching consequences for the next generation.7 If you are feeling like ending your life or feel unable to keep yourself safe, please call 999 or go to A&E and ask for the contact of the nearest crisis resolution team.

As we celebrate our 70th anniversary in 2019, it is important to reflect on how much the Mental Health Foundation has achieved in 70 years. We have seen a momentous shift in public opinion of mental health andpolicysurrounding it, as well as treatment and care of people with mental health problems. We have focused on the social issues surrounding mental health, taken multidisciplinary approaches, empowered people through co-production,peer supportandrecoveryin the community and allowed our research to inform our work on prevention of mental ill-health. Over 70 years, we have not lost sight ofour values, which have become firmly embedded in our way of working. We place an emphasis onprevention, including understanding causation and development of mental ill-health. Moving from a disease-focused model towards a holistic model. The holistic model considers social circumstances and inequalities in public mental health thinking.  Our inception in 1949 as the Mental Health Research Fund (MHRF), after the Second World War and the foundation of the NHS, was born out of theurgent need to get research funding for mental health. The Fund was set up by Derek Richter, a neuro-chemist frustrated at the lack of attention mental health research was getting and the disparities between physical and mental health funding. He said at the time: I am getting tired of this perpetual fight to get small sums of research, when our colleagues working in cancer and TB are almost embarrassed by the money being thrust at them. Derek was a keen advocate for researching the social causes of mental ill-health, setting up a wartime research laboratory for treating shellshock after the Second World War and writing several humanitarian books. Concentrating on thesocial determinantsof mental health remains our strategic focus today. In the 1950s, ignorance about mental health meant that there was extremestigmaand fear surrounding it.People with mental health problems were considered‘lunatics’ and ‘defective’and were sent off to asylums. ‘Insanity’ was thought to be incurable and there was no incentive to treat it. Amid this prejudice, stockbroker Ian Henderson partnered with Richter as Chairman of MHRF. Sir Geoffrey Vickers – distinguished lawyer and scientist – later became Chairman of the Fund’s Research Committee. The first major, multi-disciplinary psychiatric research conference hosted by MHRF took place in Oxford in 1952. It brought together a range of experts from different fields, enabling cross fertilisation of ideas in way that hadn’t previously happened. As Henderson explained: [MHRF's] outlook is … not wedded to any particular approach to this many-sided subject. MHRF began to radicalise the system by awarding research grants for mental health for the first time in 1955. MHRF awarded student psychiatry fellowships and university posts in 1960. This was ground-breaking. For the first time, between the 1950s and 1970s, academic careers in psychiatry were kickstarted where previously it had not been considered a science. Treatment was transferred from asylums in to hospitals, and public visibility of mental health problems increased in a taboo ridden society. In the 1960s,MHRF also began toinfluence policyto turn research into practice.Henderson described the motive behind their policy involvement as: not only to add to the total sum of research, but also to serve as an advisory body concerned with developing the field on a much wider scale. 1972 saw the merging of the Mental Health Research Fund with the Mental Health Trust and, in 1973, a renaming of the newly formed organisation to the Mental Health Foundation. In the 1970s, we paved the way for modern mental health research by focusing on the day-to-day experience of people living with mental health problemsat a time when research was solely laboratory focused. Putting people with mental illness at the centre of our work and learning from them is something that we still do today, by implementingpeer-to-peerandself-managementstrategies that help people to help themselves and others. In 1974, we opened ourGlasgow office, which today has developed a unique and influential role against the backdrop of a country containing some of the world’s most advanced mental health policy. We have helped develop the Scottish government’s progressive approach to mental health improvement and have been tenacious ininfluencing Scottish policyand leading innovative initiatives. We also run severalinnovative projects in Scotland, with vulnerable groups likerefugeesandyoung mothers. In the 1980s, we developed mental health research into a viable academic career.There were 49 psychiatry professorships in universities and medical schools compared with two when we started. We had allocated £1.5 million in research grants by the end of the decade to make landmark discoveries; for example, on the connection betweenphysical and mental health, thecost of mental health problemsand the relationship between mental health and brain chemistry. We were instrumental in developing support for community care and rehabilitation schemes at a time where newly established community services couldn’t cope with demand. We took steps to increase the influence of people with lived experience in mental health decision making, starting with funding the first service user consultative events in 1985. Following these events, we published a series of important publications and set up some user-led mental health networks, starting with ""Survivors Speak Out"" (1986) and then in the decades that followed ""Knowing our own minds"" (1997), ""Strategies for Living"" (2000) and the ""National Survivors User Network"" (2003). These publications and networks helped people manage their own mental health and take control of their own lives. Our main achievement at our forty-year anniversary mark in 1989 was thatwe had grown public awareness of mental health, through giving a voice to normal people and their lived experience. It was also no longer acceptable for mentally ill people to be confined for long periods of time in institutions. We had contributed to a revolution in the care of people with mental health problems, helped to enable the training and practice of professionals in psychiatry and alleviated a lot of outdated fear and misconception surrounding mental illness. Sir David Plaistow, Chairman and Chief Executive of Vickers plc commented at the time: The measure of the Foundation's achievement is that for millions of ordinary people the fear, stigma and suffering associated with mental illness is now a thing of the past. But there was still a lot more to do.Mental illness remained the most neglected area of public health in the 1980s, despite being the most widely suffered of the disease groups. Incidents of mental ill-health were still high. There had been no decline, despite the progress that had been in helping people to better cope with their mental health. We went into the 1990s with a mission to be the ‘‘authoritative centre of knowledge and expertise that sets out to influence and bring about change.’’ We identified areas for development and spent more money onsocial researchfor the first time, to work on the ground with people experiencing mental health problems. We made our first inquiries into community care and mental health experiences ofyoung people and children, which was an area that had not been thoroughly explored before. We recognised that,""intervening effectively yields huge benefits in reducing a number of problems that are of concern to government, school, parents and children."" The extent of the UK’s mental health problem was revealed in the 1990s. One in four people had experienced mental ill-health and shockingly the proportion of NHS expenditure had fallen from 15% in 1958 to just 11% in 1993.1£72 was spent on a mentally ill person’s care in hospital per day, but only 29p was spent on their care in the community.[1] Stigmawas still prevalent, with people with mental illness being portrayed as ‘dangerous’ in the media. In the face of these challenges, we started to publish key social research publications about everyday mental health experiences. By asking people their opinions about services and treatments, we were able to bring togetherstatisticsand facts on mental health in an accessible way for the first time. The 2000s saw us pioneering our role in promoting good mental health for all - not just those with mental health problems. Mental health rose up the public agenda. There was concern over the effectiveness and safety ofdrug treatmentsand a rising interest in non-medical and self-help approaches following a trend in user-led initiatives. We were embracing medical and non-medical approaches to work most effectively in a holistic way. We launched a new website in the 2000s described as ‘‘the most comprehensive European resource on mental health’’ which received millions of views. We set up Mental Health Action Week, now calledMental Health Awareness Weekin 2001, which took mental health campaigning to scale for the first time. The theme for the first campaign wasfriendship and mental health. Mental Health Awareness Week is now in its eighteenth year and annually the campaign gets bigger and the reach gets wider. This year we focused onbody image, receiving four times as much media presence as last year. Mental Health Awareness Week is now the UK’s biggest health awareness week. We released ambitious campaigns in the 2000s that were user-led and reached out to people who were ‘at risk’ but hadn’t yet experienced mental health problems. By encouraging everyone to be concerned about their mental health, we helped to tackle thestigmaaround ‘otherness’ and paved the way for our successfulpreventionfocus today. In 2007, we launchedThe Scottish Mental Health Arts Festival, which is the largest of its kind in the world and is replicated internationally. The Festival engages with artists and communities to celebrate the artistic achievements of people with experience of mental health issues and the link betweencreativityand the mind. In the 2010s, we explicitly shifted our strategic focus to mental health prevention at primary (everyone), secondary (those at risk) and tertiary (relapse for those with diagnosed mental health problems) levels. We recognised that ‘‘a world with good mental health for all is a vision that will take a global movement to achieve. It can only be achieved by a fundamental reassessment of the power of prevention to support mental health’’.Our programmes reach covers England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. We set up an office in Cardiff in 2014 which advocates for mental health policy and runs several projects including with older people, school children and single parents. We carry out important research and we offer training to prevent mental distress. Our reason for continuing to focus onprevention todayis that mental health problems are an ever-growing public health concern. A recent index of 301 diseases found mental health problems to be one of the main causes of the overall disease disability worldwide2anddepressionas the leading cause of disability in the world. The economic cost of mental ill-health in the UK is grave, at £5.4 billion in 2015, with over 91% of this amount being due to those leaving the labour force entirely.[3]One in six (17%) people over the age of 16 had a common mental health problem in the UK in 2014.[4] The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that between 35% and 50% of people with severe mental health problems in developed countries - and 76% to 85% in developing countries - receive no treatment.[5] The inequality between mental and physical health treatment is also a big concern. Current NHS waiting times for mental health services in the UK are often too long, compared with waiting times for physical illnesses. Sometimes, people can be waiting a year or more fortherapy, and during this time, their situation can rapidly decline. A report by Young Minds found that three-quarters of young people referred to NHS mental health services waited so long to be seen that their condition had deteriorated by the time they got to a doctor.[6] Crisis response for mental health emergencies is often not there. Some hospitals may see people going through mental health crises at A&E, but some won’t. Apart from charity helplines, not a lot of support exists for people who feelsuicidaland need immediate help. Life expectancy is also affected. People with severe mental illness also do not live as long as people without. For example, people withschizophreniaandbipolar disorderdie on average 10 to 20 years earlier.[7]Suicideis the most common cause of death formenaged 20 to 49 years in England and Wales.[8] Stigma, while not as extreme as when we started, is still widespread. People - especiallymenwho feel pressure to be ‘masculine’ and not talk about feelings - are still afraid to talk openly about their experiences or reach out to get the support they need. 48% of people said they would feel uncomfortabletalking to their employerabout a mental health problem. 40% of people still believe people with mental ill-health are prone toviolencewhen mentally ill people are far more likely to be the victims of crime rather than the perpetrators.[9] A survey in 2017 by Rethink Mental Illness found that of 500 hiring decision-makers or influencers, 83% would worry that someone with a severe mental illness would not be able to cope with the demands of their job.[10] According to NHS statistics in 2017, only 43% of all people with mental health problems are in employment, compared to 74% of the general population.[10] There is alsostigmain public services. People with mental health problems were more likely to report that the police had been unfairly compared to the general population.[11-12] The recent evidence shows that we still have work to do. MHRF was set up in 1949 to fill a much-needed void in mental health research. Now, in 2019, the Mental Health Foundation is celebrating its 70th anniversary. In 70 years, we have transformed knowledge of mental health, how it’s caused, treated andprevented. We have helped move services towards the community and away from hospitals and asylums. We have opened the public’s eyes to the need to protect their mental health and prevent problems from occurring and we have set upprogrammesto help people at all stages of life. Positive steps have been taken towards researching and understanding mental health and there has been vast improvement in mental health services. However, the numbers of people experiencing mental health problems is rising, waiting times are too long, theeconomic and social costis still too high andstigmais still prevalent. In the coming years, our goal is to drive change towards a mentally healthy society and support communities, families and individuals to live mentally healthier lives, with a focus on inequalities and those at greatest risk. We will keep making the case forpreventionand ensure that there is even greater public understanding of mental health and its causes, so that more people practice effectiveself-managementtechniques to stop their mental health deteriorating. We will generate and share what works, through ourco-produced and evidence-based programmes, and provide more breakthrough information on prevention of mental ill-health, so that there is a significant reduction in diagnosable levels of mental ill-health andsuicide rates. We will make sure prevention is considered in all newpolicydecisions. We will inform and empower people throughpublic engagement and campaignsto enable mentally healthier lives. We hope that as a result of our tireless mission to deliver good mental health for all, more people at risk of mental ill-health will receive necessary interventions and protection, and people will be better able to look after their mental health in a stigma-free environment that allows them to thrive.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/tattoos-inspired-your-mental-health-experience,Tattoos inspired by your mental health experience,"This content mentions depression, anxiety and panic attacks, which some people may find triggering. We recently posted aMHF Question Time poston Instagram asking people: ‘Do you have a tattoo that was inspired by your mental health experiences?’ The author of this blog, Rachel was so intrigued to see people’s responses to such a personal question that she decided to write a blog about it. The posts covered lots of topics. They were inspiring. They reinforced my belief that openness about mental health is so important and that tattoos are a wonderful way expressing our feelings and experiences. Some people had tattoos to remind them that they will get through it: Some people had tattoos that reference surviving an attempt to take their own life: I have my own mental health inspired tattoo on my inner left arm that reads ‘Comfortably Numb’. As a moody and confused teenager, overwhelmed with emotions and trying to navigate myself through school, exams, heartache and social life, I found refuge mostly in music. I used to steal my Dad’s CD collection and listen to it as much as I could, either on the school bus, at break time or at home in my room. One band that my fourteen-year-old self really connected with was Pink Floyd. I had never heard anything like them before. They were both euphoric and melancholic at the same time. The music took me to a place where all the worries I had, all the feelings of low self-esteem, anger and sadness just disappeared. It was like my escape. It was healing. The one song in particular that allowed me to feel free and let me forget the world was ‘Comfortably Numb’. The lyrics are beautiful. Songwriter Roger Waters explains that the lyrics are about what he felt like as a child when he was sick with a fever. As an adult, he got that feeling again sometimes, entering a state of delirium, where he felt detached from reality. The lyrics are reminiscent to me of how it feels to be in a heightened state of anxiety or a bad episode ofdepression. During those periods, it is common to feel delirious and detached from reality, as Waters did during his fever. The imagery for me is relatable to that terrifying feeling of uncontrollable panic, the irrational feelings and behaviour that the closest people around me when I had bad anxiety struggled to understand – my ex-boyfriend, my housemates, my colleagues. When people can’t relate to you, it makes you feel like you’re alone, a burden on people and sort of drowning, but I felt like the song understood me at my worst, so there was comfort in that. Ten years after I discovered that song, I decided to dedicate a tattoo to it aged 24, because it had already helped me so much with my mental health. I wanted to have it permanently attached to me, at a time where myanxietywas particularly bad, so that I could remember when I felt low and desperate how I was making slow and steady progress. I didn’t understand my mental health at school, and I didn’t have the tools to deal with it, so despite being an anxious young adult in London at 24, I was much more self-aware, had an improved sense of identity and was better at caring for myself. My tattoo now reminds me at 28 how far I’ve come in managing my mental health and my life in general. Mypanic attackshave stopped. I’m a lot stronger and more confident. What’s so great about tattoos is that they are a unique art form, personal to the individual. For an individual who feels a creative urge to express, or even just for someone who wants to make a statement to themselves or to others, tattoos allow you to do that. For me, my tattoo feels like an act of solidarity with myself – a reminder to carry on against adversity, a reminder about how feelings will and do pass. Comfortably Numb itself is an oxymoron, a contradiction, which I think also illustrates the complexity of mental health. How is it that I can feel numb, soulless, desperate, pained and bleak on the one hand, as though there’s not much point in carrying on with things, and also feel comfortable, protected, calm, ambitious, determined and strong on the other? I myself battle with mood swings fairly regularly, even if they are slight, which can make me feel like I am not really strongly defined as a positive or a negative, a happy or a sad, a comfortable or a numb type of person – but can interchange between all of these things in the same day, week or month. This is another reason why I love my tattoo: it reminds me of the strengths and weaknesses in my personality, the areas I am proud of and the areas I need to work on. I can’t be put in one box because there are many elements to me, some good, some bad. As someone who has been misunderstood before, this gives me strength. I am much more accepting of myself these days and the fact that I sometimes just need to allow myself to be alone, to wallow in the person I don’t like being for a bit, and that is ok. In adepressiveoranxiousmoment, I can take comfort in numbness, because I know I’ve been there before and can overcome it, and that the feeling is temporary. I feel the happiest I’ve ever felt now and that is partly because I know how dark it feels to be on the other side – remembering the younger versions of me where the negative swamped the positive most of the time. I believe that having experienced mental health problems has made me a better person today. It has given me the power of hindsight and wisdom, it has allowed me to feel grateful for my life now and be proud for how much better I am at coping. It has allowed me to feel a strong connection and empathy with others who are struggling, and to help them. The tattoo I have is wrapped up in all of that – it is part of me and the journey I have had. It is part of my identity, my image, my love of music, my love of deep and meaningful conversations and my relationships with others. It strikes me that tattoos are a perfect conversation starter about mental health. People often ask me what mine means and I don’t always go into detail but sometimes I do. Getting the elephant out of the room is something we still need to do in a world where mental health stigma still exists. It isn’t always easy to weave mental health into conversation, but tattoos can do this for us. They spark curiosity and interest from others. If a tattoo can help others feel empowered, if it can symbolize overcoming an illness that has plagued them for years, a celebration that they’ve come out of the other side fighting and well, then that is fantastic. People don’t always understand tattoos and are quick to dismiss them as spoiling or damaging yourself. But I don’t see it that way. Some of the posts we received on Instagram talked about covering up self-harm scars with tattoos – turning the horror of depression into something beautiful. Taking the focus away from a dark past and instead to a positive future. My comfortably numb tattoo might seem at a first glance to be a negative tattoo. But to me, it is positive. It is my emblem of continual self-improvement and better mental health. It is an emblem of strength and recovery.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/harsh-reality-reality-tv-and-mental-health,The harsh reality of Reality TV and mental health,"This content mentions body image or generally discusses weight, which some people may find triggering. Over the past few weeks, watchingMPs publicly questionsome of the most powerful people in UK broadcasting about programmes like Love Island, Big Brother and The Jeremy Kyle Show has been a bit like a reality TV show about reality TV. The Chief Executives of ITV and Channel 4 have been put in some highly uncomfortable positions about a style of television that specialises in filming people who are under pressure. Butthe House of Commons inquiry into such programmesis also providing some welcome scrutiny of what reality TV means for the human beings involved. So far, attention has focused overwhelmingly on themen and womenwho appear on reality TV shows – how are they selected, treated during filming and looked after (or not) once production has finished. But inChannel 4’s written evidence to MPs, published this week, there are some fascinating clues about how reality TV might affect the millions of people on the other side of the screen: the viewers. This has been a question the Foundation has raised since MPs announced their inquiry into reality TV. I have always believed that a social problem on the scale of mental illness can only be addressed if it becomes everyone’s business. In a tantalising glimpse of what TV companies know about this (and essentially what their programmes mean for audiences), Channel 4 has dared to suggest that reality TV has “the potential” to do good. In support of this, it cites its own research findings about how some of its reality shows have, for instance, led some viewers to use social media more carefully (The Circle), to feel greater understanding for people who are not neurotypical (The Undateables) and to reflect on their prejudices (Bride and Prejudice). Channel 4 also mentions its programmeNaked Beach, which featured participants of different shapes and sizes naked on a beach, suggesting that viewers will have benefited from seeing people who looked like them and not only those with idealised and unattainable bodies. By contrast, ITV seems to have gone out of its way to avoid mentioning how millions of TV viewers are influenced by its shows. In 150 pages of evidence to Parliament’s reality TV inquiry and in several hours of questioning by MPs, the company has not mentioned audience impacts. It’s easy to speculate about why ITV has avoided this topic (despite good broadcasting work duringMental Health Awareness Week), but the important point here is that the millions of people who watch reality TV shows are often affected by what they see. Research has pointed to the existence of “media contagion”, ranging from spreading panic (which leads to further unhealthy choices) to having a negative impact on adolescent values, and from fuelling exploitative advertising to triggering increasing trends insuicides. Only this week, it was reported that Love Island appears to be affecting the behaviour of someprimary school children. At the Mental Health Foundation, we have been especially concerned with how viewers may compare themselves with the people they see on screen – for instance, onITV’s Love Island. Academic research suggests that people do compare themselves, and that feeling they don’t measure up can contribute towards them feeling more shame and distress about their ownbodies. This, in turn, can contribute towards some people having more serious emotional difficulties. Survey evidence commissioned by the Mental Health Foundationpoints in a similar direction. Almost one-quarter (24%) of 18-to-24-year-olds told YouGov that reality TV makes them worry about their body image. Our poll also suggested that the sameyoung peopleare already more vulnerable than older adults to body-related distress, with nearly one-quarter of them (23%) also saying they had hadsuicidal feelingsbecause of concerns about their bodies. These are some of the reasons why we were deeply disappointed when we saw the people selected to take part in the current season of Love Island, all of whom are young and conform to stereotypical ideals of whatmen and womenshould look like. Several are actually professional models. My point here is not that Love Island and other reality TV shows should be taken off air. Millions of people choose to watch them and enjoy them – and as Channel 4 has hinted, they can do good. Rather,I’m suggesting that it’s time everyone taking a critical look at reality TV, as well as those making it, should consider how it affects viewers, as well as their participants.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/instagram-i-both-love-and-loathe-it-my-mental-health,Instagram: I both love and loathe it for my mental health,"This content mentions body image (or generally discusses weight), loneliness or isolation and depression, which some people may find triggering. A guest blogger, Rachel talks us through why Instagram can be both good and bad for your mental health, and how to strike the balance to find healthy social media use that works for you. We recently posted a question on #MHFQuestionTime: which Instagram accounts help you with your mental health? People posted about accounts that help them feel connected to a social or cultural group, that are aligned to their hobbies and interests or that promote self-care, health and wellbeing. Some people said that Instagram does not help their mental health at all, and actually does the opposite. For me personally, Instagram is probably the only thing in my life that I love and hate in equal measure. Part of me wishes it had never existed and the other part of me is really glad that it does. I think it’s important to consider the pros and cons to the app, because it is not helpful or accurate to condemn it as always damaging and detrimental. It’s really not that simple. What’s important to recognise with social media, as with anything that can be considered a vice or an addiction, is that it is all about striking a healthy balance and making sure that our relationship is a positive one. Self-esteem, identity and self-worth are usually going to be linked in some way to our online presence. When Instagram first started out it in 2010, it was a simple photography app. People didn’t really use it in the UK until about 2013. It was nice to have but by no means significant, and it didn’t take up much thought in people’s minds. You used it to share your edgy photo of a window, your unoriginal holiday sunset or your avocado and not much else. You had followers, but these were just your close mates. You didn’t always get likes on your photos, but it didn’t matter because only 20 people saw it, including your tech savvy Nan and that creepy person at school you hadn’t seen in years but who always fancied you a bit. And that was it. You could post the occasional selfie without worrying if it crashed and burned. Facebook still reigned supreme. In 2019, Instagram is like your cool CV Fast forward nine years to 2019 and your Instagram account is like your cool CV. You’d think twice about posting your sunset or your avocado now, because not only does tech savvy Nan see it (and she always sees it) but so does everyone else. There’s a pressure to impress. Instagram’s reach is a lot wider; the celebrities, influencers and teenagers have taken over, and it is now a platform where everyone can try and turn themselves into a brand. There are people who literally make a living out of being cool on Instagram. These are the people who dedicate their days to posting photos of themselves wearing, doing, eating the latest thing. Aspiring models, bloggers, fashionistas, yogis, musicians, entrepreneurs, wellbeing gurus, foodies and general trendsetters. Instagram is their business. They get paid to promote things and the amount of followers and likes they have does actually matter. So much so that it is now possible to buy Instagram followers and likes.It’s become more and more about you and your image. Are influencers and celebrities setting a dangerous precedent on Instagram by placing so much emphasis on how attractive we look and how cool we are? Does the everyday person look at Kim Kardashian’s or Drake’s Instagram and feel inadequate about themselves as a result? We know that people’s mental wellbeing is linked closely to theirbody imageand how they feel about their bodies, for one thing. We are often presented with idealistic, unrealistic, airbrushed images on the platform that may make us feel inadequate about ourselves. Is Instagram just another thing that piles the social pressure onto people, especiallyyoung people, that affects their confidence and self-worth, and is therefore unhealthy and to be avoided at all costs? Some might argue yes. But the facts are actually not pointing to an overall negative result. The report'Social Media, Social Life: Teens Reveal Their Experiences by Common Sense Media'in 2018 found that among 11- to 17-year olds, only a few said using social media had a negative effect on how they feel about themselves: Vulnerable teens were the group most likely to say they’ve had negative responses to social media, such as feeling bad about themselves when nobody comments or likes their posts. But they were also the group that reported that Instagram had the most positive effect on them. So why was this? For me, the positive side of Instagram is about feeling connected. We want to feel connected. It makes us feel good about ourselves and our relationships. People want to share their experiences with others online, they want to feel part of a community. They want to keep up-to-date with their friends, especially in a busy world where we may not see someone in person for ages, or they may live far away. We also want to feel distracted from the mundane and stressful realities of life. For the more vulnerable types, people who are lonely, shy, don’t feel they fit in, the online community can provide a lot of comfort and connect you with new groups of likeminded people. Having the ability to speak online is sometimes liberating for people who struggle to communicate face-to-face. But are we losing the ability to communicate properly in real life? We need to be careful to make sure we are being mindful of current experiences and conversations with others. I try and put my phone away when I’m hanging out with a friend, at a gig, having a meal, to make sure I am experiencing being in that moment as much as possible. I think that whether our experience of social media is positive has a lot to do with how healthy our relationship to it is.I have deleted Instagram off my phone on countless occasions because I have felt myself getting into a negative spiral on there – looking at things that make me feel bad about myself, spending too much time on it, checking likes. I’ve wanted to take back control of my life and spend time doing things that are meaningful and positive. But even though I loathe Instagram when I find myself mindlessly scrolling, there is a side to Instagram that I love. I am someone who enjoys sharing content with others. I love taking photos and capturing events. I like the way my profile is a visual trip down memory lane. I like looking back on what I was doing five years ago. I also have a desire to share mycreative side. I struggle with stage-fright and self-doubt, so I would never have the confidence to perform in front of an audience singing and playing the guitar. I actually froze when I had to do just that in a guitar show at school aged 14. But I can record myself and post it on Instagram from the comfort of my living room. The first time I did it I was scared, but I got a positive reaction and it encouraged me. Now I do it without giving it much thought. I have found that using the platform for creative outlets is almost exclusively positive. People are supportive and enthusiastic. They inspire and empower each other. I now have a separate page just for my paintings. Instagram allows me to do this. It gives you direct access, via hashtags, to the exact audience you want to target, which is amazing. It is something that I’m sure other introverted creatives, who may also be struggling with their mental health and need an outlet, would really value. I think that if our relationship with ourselves is negative then Instagram can unfortunately exacerbate this. If we don’t have a strong sense of self, we can concentrate too much on how popular, attractive or successful we come across on social media. We have not learnt to be happy with ourselves the way we are, without seeking validation from a platform that is not real life, but superficial. People can easily feel rejected, unhappy or jealous on Instagram. We can use it in a toxic way if we’re not careful – unhealthily stalking others (exes, ghosters, arch nemeses) comparing yourself to others (better looking, funnier, cooler friends) and generally not living life in the moment. Instagram can be empowering and inspiring if you let it be. Some influencers have accounts that are aimed at inspiring people and promoting positivity and wellbeing. Not everyone is a narcissist. I only follow people and things that are positive and helpful in my life. I follow my favourite bands, organisations, influential people I admire, people who inspire me to be better and my best friends. So, I would urge others to do the same and fill their newsfeed with things that boost them up and don’t drag them down.If you have a problem with yourbody image, then do not follow models who have unrealistic bodies, who are posting heavily edited photos of themselves. Remember this isn’t real life, it’s an idealised life. Also remember that people never post their bad moments on Instagram (crying in the bath with a glass of wine) – only their happy, attractive sides (got a new haircut, look how great it is). I don’t think it’s helpful to just condemn Instagram as completely bad, and I won’t be getting rid of it anytime soon (well I might for a day but then I’ll probably download it again). However, I think we all need to exercise caution on the app. Only follow people that you care about and who care about you. For Instagram to work for you, you need to feel empowered by it, not overwhelmed by it. Be selective in who and what you interact with on there, and as a result your experience will be positive.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/mental-health-policy-landscape-2017-2018,The mental health policy landscape: 2017 into 2018,"2017 was a year that reframed the UK's political landscape. The triggering of Article 50 set the wheels in motion to exit the European Union, and the Conservatives lost their majority in the general election in May. While these events dominated the headlines, 2017 was also a year that shifted the landscape of mental health policy. The 2017 Queen's Speech established the Conservative minority government's commitment to reform mental health legislation, confirmed it would publish a Green Paper on Children and Young People's Mental Health and reiterated it would make mental health a priority in the NHS. These are all indicators that mental health continues to have prominence in the policy and legislative agenda, but question marks remain around the government’s commitment to adoptingpreventionmeasures to appropriately safeguard the nation’s mental health. Last year was bookended by steps towards achieving the ambitions of the Mental Health Taskforce's Five Year Forward View for Mental Health - the government's response being announced in January and the research strategy in December. In response to the public's input to the Taskforce work, high priority was given to a call for increased help to prevent people developing mental ill-health and for muchearlier interventionand this resulted in the publication of the Prevention Concordat for Better Mental Health in August. The Concordat represents a welcome move to look upstream, focusing attention on the social causes of mental ill-health, demonstrating a keen understanding that policies cannot continue to focus on crisis care. An increased focus on prevention and early intervention does not, of course, negate the need to address and treat diagnosed mental health conditions effectively and at the time the need arises. This remains vital. However, a rebalancing towards prevention is crucial for helping to ensure that unprecedented demands on the health service, as well as interrelated demands on other public services, are effectively addressed. While progress was made to shape a new policy framework through which to tackle the mental health crisis, a number of reports were published which demonstratethe stark inequalities experienced across the UKand reinforce the urgent need to incorporate mental health into all policies. The fifth annual 'State of the Nation' report from theSocial Mobility Commissionis just one example illustrating the extent to which inequalities experienced across the UK have become so deeply entrenched. TheCare Quality Commission’sreport on the state of care in mental health services 2014 to 2017 shone a light on the severe shortcomings existing in the current system. The report highlights core challenges around access to mental health crisis care, which represents a “major issue”, with 26% of people who try to contact support services not getting the help they need. Similar issues of individuals not receiving the help they need can be identified inThriving at Work, an independent review of mental health and employers by Lord Dennis Stevenson and Paul Farmer. The report found that around 300,000 people with a long-term mental health problem lose their jobs each year. Underpinning the success of the prevention agenda is the urgent need to address inequalities, and it is clear from the reports published last year that there is still a long way to go. Given that vulnerable groups are exposed to preventable risks to mental health, greater attention needs to be paid to mental health problems related to marginalisation. Mental health is a cross-cutting and mediating factor inpublic policy, as highlighted by each of these reports and the Prevention Concordat. Wider public services must urgently assume a more integrated approach to ensure that the protection and improvement of mental health becomes a collective effort across those parts of the system that have a key role in influencing it. As we look to 2018, the government must ensure its policies are underpinned by a drive to help people thrive mentally, not just survive. It is critical to address the inequities that exist in the system. Opportunities for this to be achieved can be seen in the Children and Young People’s Green Paper and the independent review of the Mental Health Act. The consultation on the government’s Children and Young People’s Green Paper opens a new chapter inchildren and young people’s mental healthprotection and improvement that is so desperately needed. While further clarity is required on what exactly the government’s commitment to prevention means in policy terms, this formal recognition of the prevention agenda presents new opportunities to shape appropriate measures to safeguard children and young people’s mental health and, importantly, reduce the pain of mental distress and improve the quality of the lives of children and young people. While the Green Paper focuses on schools, it’s important to be aware that in working to reduce the prevalence of mental health problems, and to make the biggest difference, we need to start at the earliest point, focusing a good deal on child development from conception onwards. The Conservatives’ commitment to review the Mental Health Act 1983 will be another key feature of the 2018 landscape. The review will examine the causes of the rise in detentions under the Act, the continued disproportionate use of the Act in relation toBAME (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic)people, and concerns around safeguards. The scope of the review will be clearer in April, when it publishes its Interim Report. However, it represents the government’s awareness that mental health legislation needs to provide those with mental health problems with choice and, importantly, dignity. This said, the review of the Act cannot be seen in isolation; without addressing the factors that result in people ending up in crisis, there will continue to be a system failure. Today's policy landscape provides some reason for optimism, with the wheels in motion to reform parts of the system. This said, real and lasting change can only be achieved through a holistic approach. Mental health policies cannot be seen in isolation: the causes, impacts and solutions around mental health issues also need to be explored outside the health sector, reframing the current narrative. We must look to our schools, workplaces and communities not just to support people who are struggling and support them earlier, but to promote their emotional well-being. There is political appetite for change, and the New Year offers a number of opportunities to turn this into action. 2017 was a year that saw mental health continue to be high on the political agenda; we must use 2018 as the year to ensure that the rhetoric is further translated into a holistic strategy that also champions early intervention and prevention. Our policy and advocacy work calls on national and local government to reduce the factors known to pose a risk to people’s mental health, enhance those known to protect it and create the conditions needed for people to thrive. To learn how we can prevent mental health problems, we need to search for answers to this fundamental question: what causes mental health problems? 7th May 2025

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/political-change-and-mental-health,Political change and mental health,"This content discusses anxiety and discrimination or discriminatory violence (such as homophobia, racism, sexism and ableism), which some people may find triggering. Political uncertainty can be challenging, regardless of our beliefs or where we might fall on the political spectrum. Political change can affect us in different ways and, for many of us, transition of political powers and uncertainty may causestressandanxietyabout the future of our country. Major political and economic fluctuations, such asBrexit, may also have unexpected consequences on the health of an entire population, even before they directly affect someone’s employment, business or immigration status.[1] In public health, some similarities have been identified between the 2016 US presidential vote and the referendum on Britain’s place in the European Union, with predicted effects on global public health. Increased xenophobia andracismwill harm public health, indicatively through reduced openness torefugeesand increased use ofmilitary forces.[2] For example, soon after the referendum, the UK saw a spike in hate crimes.[3] We need to be mindful that vulnerable and marginalised groups in our society feel at risk of losing many individual human rights gained under EU law: the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights will not be part of domestic UK legislation after the country leaves the EU. This means that the mental health ofBlack, Asian, and Minority Ethniccommunities might seriously be undermined.[4] Major political transitions often lead to a time of limited economic growth, in which there are concerns that funds for healthcare and thesocial determinantsof health will decrease. It’s been over two years since 52% of voters in the UK EU Exit Referendum chose to leave the European Union, releasing a wave of uncertainty on whether the UK will negotiate a deal or leave the EU without one. This uncertainty can affect our mental health. Initial studies (up to autumn 2017) have shown a degree of decrease of subjective well-being following post-Brexit elections for those with very negative attitudes towards the EU. A short-term increase in subjective well-being was followed by significant decreases, which may be linked to distress or unmet expectations of a “hard(er)” Brexit’.[5] In addition, a recent study in the UK highlighted that uncertainty induced by the Brexit referendum may have influenced the increasing rate ofantidepressant prescribing(in contrast to physical health medication), however the researchers concluded that results may also be impacted by other external factors.[6] Looking at society more widely, most importantly, the messages that we can take from such studies, are how we can work on appropriate policy change. First, policies and availability of services supporting mental health should be intensified in periods of uncertainty. Secondly, the Brexit vote might have consequences beyond the political and financial changes in trade, immigration or the economy, influencing the psychological well-being of individuals. However, discussion of the impact on the population health and well-being has been limited so far. We need to remember that we are not immune to political change and social uncertainty. Evidence from the big Stress in America™ survey (ran by the American Psychological Association in 2016) revealed that 66% of people saw the future of their nation as a significant source ofstress, while 57% felt stressed by the current political climate following the presidential elections.[7] The survey we ran at the Mental Health Foundation in 2018 of over 1800 parents revealed that almost 4 in 10 parents (39%) were concerned that their children are becoming moreanxiousaboutworld and national events.[8] For example, almost a quarter of parents (23%) indicated their children were anxious about the threat of nuclear war and a third of parents (33%) thought their children were anxious about Donald Trump’s presidency. Of those whose children were anxious, 6 in 10 (61%) had noticed their children starting to ask a lot more questions and a quarter (24%) had noticed their children seeking reassurance. Surveys like these support the fact that situations like Brexit often place us in collectively stressful circumstances. Symptoms of stress can vary from person to person, but often include a combination of emotional (powerlessness,anger, worry, tension, irritability) and physical (headaches,insomnia, stomach problems) reactions. People experience stress in very different ways, and deal with it each in a unique manner. Keen to support people to take control of their mental health in challenging times like this, we are publishing some recommendations today onhow to maintain healthy levels of stress in circumstances of political change. We are also announcing today that we are working with Public Health Wales to develop a framework that will support themental health and well-being of farmers in the face of the uncertainties around Brexit.

Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. This New Year’s Day, we woke to an anniversary at the Mental Health Foundation. 2019 marks 70 years since the organisation was founded, then known as the Mental Health Research Fund. We are proud to represent 70 years of innovation in mental health. And it seems that the times have never been more welcoming to positive change. To achieve this change, we need to all join the mission that makes most sense:preventing mental health problems. Our original focus in 1949was to turn research into action and to look into the different conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age and how this may impact their mental health. We took an approach that crossed the traditional boundaries of psychiatry and invited conversations and research across disciplines. Later on, we were among the pioneers who gave people living with mental health problems a voice in their care and the decisions affecting their lives. More recently, we have looked into evidence-based public mental health activities. This means we have started developing solutions that work to change systems and structures and offer resources to help protect our mental health and started campaigning to createpoliticaland societal change. Taking a holistic view of mental health, includingprevention, has been at theheart of our work throughout all of these 70 years. Based on the best data that we have,depressionis the leading cause of disability worldwide and 1 in 6 of us is facing a common mental health problem every week. This is more than 10 million people in the UK. Can our overstretched NHS cope with more than 10 million people asking for clinical help because they are experiencing distress every week? The answer is simply: no. Hence, we need to do more to prevent such problems in the first instance by taking responsibility for mental health in ourworkplaces, schools, homes and those of our communities that have the least power to influence change.Mental health problems can be prevented. 70 years ago, our founder Derek Richter talked about the impact of issues liketraumaandpovertyon our mental health. We now know that we are not just victims of genes, but there is a big range of social, economic, family and emotional factors that interact with our genes. These factors can make us more or less likely to develop a mental health problem. So, beyond our genes, our mental health is fundamentally shaped by two sets of circumstances: Firstly, the deeply personal experiences that define us (like our relationships and how we see ourselves), and secondly, the social circumstances we find ourselves in (like poverty, violence and unemployment). If we can tackle the risk factors, we can achieve this critical mission of reducing the numbers and severity of mental health problems. We can also improve resilience to those bumps in the road that aren’t readily preventable.The determinants of mental health problems can be controlled. Of course, we shouldn’t underestimate the distress mental health problems can cause for people and families. Every day, hundreds of thousands of us are feeling limited and disabled by symptoms. Every day, thousands of us are experiencingsuicidal thoughts. And 16 of our fellow citizens – every single day – will reach their lowest point and take their own lives, seeking relief from what they perceived as permanent problems. But perhaps, in reality, these problems could have been managed with professional help. We have learned so much about preventing these crisis points in the last 70 years. We have learned how a combination of clinical help, social support and personal intervention can make the biggest difference in people’s lives, which has recently led to a reduction inthe numbers of suicidesin England. Yet, we haven’t achieved the necessarypolicy changeor implemented the rightprogrammesto support this.Mental health crisis andsuicidecan be prevented. Even much earlier than these crisis points, distress tends to reach us at times when we are most vulnerable. Distress often bites during ourtransitions: bigger (leaving our family home for the first time) or smaller (changing a job); negative (being made redundant) or positive (becoming aparent). Or like when our physical health is challenged: by something serious (a cancer diagnosis) or something more common (not getting enoughsleep). It is at times like these when we turn to our fundamental protective factors: our education and emotional literacy, our families and friends, our hobbies and talents. There are several evidence-based ways – simple or more complicated – that serve the same purpose of protecting our mental health. Yet, many of us have never received this information in an accessible way (or young enough) and, as a result, were never given the chance to thrive. While we keep working across the sector and government to correct this inequality, we can all start from our homes and communities when things get too much: be kind to yourself and compassionate to your friends and this could go a long way.Mental distress can be prevented. In the past 70 years, we’ve learned to ask to be vaccinated to prevent infectious diseases, we’ve got used to talking about family planning and contraception to protect our personal health, we’ve grown to consistently follow laws to wear seatbelts and not smoke indoors to prevent injuries and cancer. We’ve made incredible progress to prevent simple or severe problems facing our physical health, andreduced the numbers of childhood deaths for children under 5 years old from over 20% to less than 5%. Our next milestone is to make the same progress for our mental health. At a deep, fundamental level, our mental health is a mediator of our overall good health. And nothing helps our health more than structures that fully and freely allow and empower us to develop ourselves as social beings with a sense of purpose, value and belonging.Our mental health can be protected. Preventionis possible. But it’s a difficult personal goal. Because often our everydaystressesconsume us, and we tend to understand its value only when we notice a crisis. And it’s a hard political sell. Because it is achieved through concentrated, cross-government, long-term commitments that go beyond the average political cycles. And it’s a high social aim. Because several of the determinants allowing prevention can only be shifted through addressing issues of social justice. And it represents a big community shift. Because we’ve mystified mental ill-health diagnoses for centuries and we’re still catching up on thestigmawe’ve allowed to penetrate our way of thinking. The challenges are many. But not disheartening. So let us look forward to the next 70 years and embrace this challenge of prevention. And when we achieve the promised progress, we will look back and see that this was our time’s greatest contribution to human flourishing. Join us in a future where we can all thrive with good mental health.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/holocaust-memorial-day-remembering-psychiatric-patients-who-were-victims-nazi-persecution,Holocaust Memorial Day: remembering the psychiatric patients who were victims of Nazi persecution,"This content mentions death or bereavement and discusses discrimination or discriminatory violence (such as antisemitism, homophobia, racism, sexism and ableism), which some people may find triggering. We’re all familiar with the horror of the Nazi attempts to annihilate the Jewish population in the 1940s – the Holocaust. One of the less well-known aspects of Nazi policy was the genocide that included the slaughter of up to 275,0001psychiatric patients. The majority of them, like me, had a diagnosis ofschizophrenia. A further 400,000 people were sterilised on medical grounds. Between 1941 and 1945, the Nazis attempted to kill all Jewish people in Europe. This is known as the Holocaust (The Shoah in Hebrew). In addition, the Nazis targeted Gypsies,Black people, Slavic people,LGBTQIA+ people, people with disabilities, political opponents and those whose religious beliefs conflicted with Nazi ideology. (Information taken from theHolocaust Memorial Day Trust website) This year’s theme for Holocaust Memorial Day is “how can life go on?” It includes remembering past events, encouraging us to consider how we are facing hate today and how we can help people from persecuted groups to ensure that life goes on in the face of hate and persecution. With these themes in mind, consider some of the arguments used to promote the murderous policy adopted toward psychiatric patients and why we must be aware of the impact this thinking could have now and in the future. In the 1930s, the eugenics movement was well established in the US and UK. The work of Ernst Rüdin and Franz Kallmann reinforced this - they believed that schizophrenia was simply an inherited disease. It became part of the quest for rassenhygiene (racial hygiene), which drove the Holocaust with mass murder at its core. But this interpretation of the science was by no means the only driver. One early motivation was cutting the cost of care for psychiatric patients. Funding for care decreased as demand increased.2 In 1920, Karl Binding and Alfred Hoche published Permission for the Destruction of Life Unworthy of Life. In it, they asked the question “Is there human life [whose] prolongation represents a perpetual loss of value, both for its bearer and for society as a whole?” They answered this by describing patients as “mentally dead”. This argument was repeated in, among others, The Eradication of the Less Valuable from Society.2 Hitler adopted these arguments. The result was a memorandum on ""the destruction of life unworthy of life"" and a draft law that included the following provision: ""The life of a person who, because of incurable mental illness, requires permanent institutionalisation and is not able to sustain an independent existence, may be prematurely terminated by medical measures in a painless and covert manner. Selected professors of psychiatry and asylum directors, known to be sympathetic to the plan, were asked to comment on the draft. All agreed that such a programme was necessary.""1,2,3 On 1 September 1939, Hitler wrote a letter authorising the programme to kill psychiatric patients and, from October that year, a committee of psychiatrists assessed all patients. The committee identified the first 70,000 patients who were to die as part of the policy. By August 1941, records showed that 70,273 patients had been killed. The killing continued throughout the war. The exact figures are unknown but the best estimates give us 200,000 to 275,000, with a further 400,000 subjected to forced sterilisation. In short, the murder of about a quarter of a million, just like many of our fellow citizens who today thrive in their families and workplaces, was based on poor science, cost-cutting, economic prejudice, propaganda and media portrayals which presented us as worthless substandard human beings. In Nazi Germany, a diagnosis of schizophrenia was a death sentence. Today it merely reduces life expectancy by 10-25 years (Laursen, Munk-Olsen, & Vestergaard, 2012). Thankfully, in large part attitudes towards people living with mental health problems have improved dramatically. However, this isn’t to say that discrimination doesn’t exist. We must remain ever vigilant. There is no better time to remember the importance of behaving as a whole community. We must never forget what happens when hatred, discrimination, poor science and blaming community problems on the most disadvantaged in communities goes unchallenged.

Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. Everyone can make a difference to others who have reached the point of wanting to end their lives. The need forsuicide preventionis at least as great as ever. In the UK, the suicide rates continued to rise, according to thelatest figuresfrom the Office of National Statistics.The 2019 rates for men were at their highest level since 2000. Men aged 45 to 49 years had the highest age-specific suicide rate; for females, the age group with the highest rate was 50 to 54 years. Rise in suicides likely to be linked to austerity - but the story behind each suicide is complex The Mental Health Foundation is concerned but not surprised by the latest UK suicide figures. They are in line with other evidence of the distress people are feeling, such as rates of self-harm and self-reported feelings of shame. Some of the rise in the number of suicides may be due to a change in the rules in England and Wales about how coroners should record suicides. However, it is currently too soon to know what difference the change has made. Whenever a person takes their own life, there is a complex story behind it. There is alsonot a single simple explanationfor the increase in the number of people taking their own lives, but it is likely to be linked with economic austerity. We know that suicide rates are linked with people's uncertainty about their financial futures, unemployment, persistent inequality, loneliness, discrimination and ill-health. Our own researchshows significant numbers of people expressing suicidal thoughts as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. This has been particularly high amongst a number of disadvantaged groups including young adults, people with pre-existing mental health concerns, single parents and unemployed people or those in insecure employment. Any effective response to the pandemic and how we, as a society recover, needs to both tackle this disadvantage and prevent suicidal thoughts becoming deeds. In 2019three-quarters of suicides were men. It is not good enough to say that men don’t seek help; we need to ask why our support mechanisms are ineffective for, or inaccessible to, the group that needs them most. In the case of suicide prevention, this means men, andin particular menin their mid-late forties. Investing more in NHS mental health services will help some people - but is not nearly enough in itself to reduce the number of people ending their own lives. Suicide prevention should start long before people end up in crisis, to minimise the distress that people experience before they get effective help, which for many will never be there. Prevention must happen in schools, in workplaces, in support for families, in local community organisations and in GPs' surgeries.

Every studentsuicideis a tragedy and actions should be taken topreventthis from happening. However, it is important to note that although student suicide is incredibly concerning, therate of suicideamong university students is actually significantly lower when compared with the general population ofyoung people, which includes students and non-students.1This suggests that we need to work together across different sectors to reduce the number of suicides among young people. Looking at data over an 18-year period (2000 to 2017), two thirds of student suicides in England and Wales were amongyoung men.[1] Why might this be the case? Though suicide is not a mental health problem itself, it is linked with acute mental distress, so taking a closer look at gender differences in mental health could help us better understand this disparity. Sticking too rigidly to traditional ideas of masculinity, which tend to favour strength, stoicism, dominance and control, may have a negative impact onmen’s mental health. This may also stop them from expressing concerns about their mental health and seeking help. Men may also be more likely toexhibit symptoms of depression through angeror irritation, which means they may be overlooked or misdiagnosed by services. Given that mental health issues increase the risk of suicide, it is of great importance that we reach out proactively to male students who may be struggling with their mental health. Papyrus and Universities UK have recently publishedguidance around suicide prevention in universitieswhich includes a checklist of practical steps to take.3Among other things, the guidance calls for suicide awareness training for all student-facing staff. This training aims to help staff spot and respond to signs of student distress. Although helpful, suicide awareness training should consider the potential emotional issues, not just for students, but for academic and teaching staff, who are increasingly expected to adopt welfare responsibilities for students in addition to their core role. Despite an increased focus on student mental health, there is still much more to learn about suicide in the student population. This means that accurate data and more in-depth research about students who die by suicide are needed to enhance our understanding of this complex issue. The whole-university approach to suicide prevention: whereby university leaders take an organisational approach to the mental health of their students and staff and make suicide prevention an institutional priority. This needs to be informed by best practice. Students commonly experience competing demands from their personal and academic lives. When it comes toprevention, equipping students with the skills to manage these pressures as well as look after their mental health and well-being may help stop mental health problems from developing in the first place. It is a good idea to explore what your university offers, whether these are societies, sports or volunteering groups, to see whether you can find like-minded people. However, finding like-minded people doesn’t have to take place on campus. There is a world beyond university, and you may find groups that you would like to join or activities that appeal to you in your local community. Understanding what services are available in your university is important and many students aren’t aware of this. You could act as an informal champion of student mental health and spread this information to some of your peers. Notice and reach out to fellow students when you can see they may be struggling.Signs of difficulty with mental healthmight include, among other things, acting withdrawn or talking about feeling hopeless, ashamed or trapped. It’s OK to ask your fellow students how they are feeling and to offer to listen supportively. This can help create a culture of openness and help everyone to feel more connected. If you are a student and you need urgent support, you can talk to someone from the Samaritans for free, 24/7 on 116 123.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/how-can-we-stop-social-media-undermining-our-mental-health,How can we stop social media undermining our mental health?,"This content mentions anxiety, which some people may find triggering. Rather than asking if social media is THE problem, let’s for a moment ask what the screen reflects. Our desire to capture and communicate a positive identity has always existed. Keeping diaries was all the rage for millions of our Victorian-era predecessors. Social media is the latest manifestation. Social media is something we brought into existence, not something that happened to us. Its skeleton is a vast network of algorithms, built to reflect and take advantage of our desires and behaviours. One of these behaviours - social comparison - was captured perfectly in 1913, when a US comic strip coined the phrase 'keeping up with the Joneses'. The comic resonated with millions of Americans, capturing theanxietyand misery of looking over the fence to our neighbours for comparison and benchmarks for success. Today, we can see far beyond that fence. The average Facebook user can see into the lives of 338 friends. Naturally, we're starting to wonder if our expanded line of sight could be having a negative impact on our mental health. What we do know is thatself-acceptance and self-esteem are crucial for good mental health. Comparing ourselves to others, be it online or offline, can undermine these things, giving rise to feelings of inadequacy. One study suggests that whether or not comparing ourselves to others online can harm us depends on a number of factors, namely: Based on this, then, online comparison could be particularly harmful if we spend a lot of time comparing our lives to the highlights of our friends lives. To try to reduce the impact of these three factors in our own lives, there are a couple of things we could try. The first challenge will be catching those unconscious moments when we slip into comparison mode. We could try to be more intentional with the time we spend on social media. Deleting mobile apps and logging into desktop versions while getting into this habit could help. Often, we can unconsciously open our phones and start scrolling through our feeds, regaining consciousness ten minutes into comparing ourselves to our feeds! We could also seek out more life-affirming content that reflects the behind-the-scenes of our realities. This could help to minimise the alienating impact of seeing nothing but highlights. There are tons of social media groups based on a range of things we will recognise from our own lives, including mental health peer support groups and communities. For the final similarity factor, it might be worth thinking about who, from our social feeds, we feel most in competition with. Are there any particular names that come to mind that maybe trigger feelings of insecurity? Consider un-following them for a while on apps where this is possible. It's not the same as unfriending so they won't know, it just means you won't see them in your feed for a while. By moving beyond asking if social media is the problem, and starting to dissect the root problems it could be reflecting on us, maybe we can minimise the opportunity social media has to undermine our mental health.

      / Challenging mental health inequalities This piece explores some of the historical factors that affect mental health within the Black community, explains how this history shapes Black mental health today, why ‘resilience’ can be a double-edged term, and what should change to address these inequalities. 2nd Jul 2025
      / Challenging mental health inequalities The government has released the latest data about mental illness and treatment across the population in England. It confirms that more people than ever are struggling with their mental health - and they are not making it up. This content is tagged with: Home of Mental Health Awareness Week"
https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/mental-health-advice-my-younger-self,Mental health advice to my younger self,"This content mentions suicide or suicidal thoughts, substance abuse and addiction (which may include mentions of alcohol or drug use) and anxiety. Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. One of the best questions we can ask ourselves is 'What advice would you give your younger self?' Often. we are experts in our own mental health without realising. So, with taking time to reflect on this question, we can reveal our own pearls of mental health wisdom. Rachel talks to you in this blog about what she has learnt throughout her life, about her own mental health and how to live a life true to her. We asked our followers on Instagram what mental health advice they’d give their younger selves. Here are some of the themes that came up: I’m 29 now and in my short life, my mental health has been hard to deal with. It has been unstable at times but is a lot better than it used to be. This is undoubtedly because of my improved awareness about what’s going on in my head, the causes of mental ill-health, support from professionals, friends and colleagues andself-managementtechniques. It’s mostly come from becoming a watcher of my thinking, through things likemeditation, and from a better intelligence of my triggers, my thinking errors and my repeated behaviours and the feelings that sit behind them. At 29 I’m not perfect and I still struggle with emotional instability, low self-esteem,anxiety,wishing I didn’t existat times and negative thinking. I realise now more than ever I am not my thoughts or the negative voice in my head. I feel empowered by the understanding I have of mental health and the hope that I’ve found in knowing that old behaviours and feelings aren’t damningly permanent, but optimistically changeable and I can overcome patterns and get out of dark holes. I have watched myself improve, mellow and reject old behaviours, and be more decisive in how I choose to react. I am also more conscious of the present and more aware of the positive in the every day. I think less catastrophically when things go wrong, I am better at reassuring myself that everything will be ok. It is not the end of the world. I know that nothing is permanent and can rely on that in tough times. I was born sensitive. It was apparent when I was a baby how loud noise and other sensory overloads affected me. I barely cried, but my face would wince with a sound and I didn’t like chaos or being left in new situations with new people. I was a deep thinker even as a baby. I would often lie awake at night taking in all my surroundings and muttering to myself. From a young age, I remembered words of books my mum read me by heart and would say them out loud or sing songs to send myself off to sleep. I was inquisitive, always questioning the norm and asking why. So much so that my mum would sometimes get annoyed and tell me ‘that’s why’. I had a vivid imagination and I wascreative, writing stories from a young age and playing imaginary games – I genuinely believed that my bed was a spaceship travelling through time, like in Bedknobs and Broomsticks. I was easily embarrassed and affected by what I perceived to be people watching me or teasing me. I sought people’s approval and felt devastated if I didn’t get it. I was sometimes crippled by my shyness. As a result of not being confident in situations I wanted to be, I had quite intense mood swings – was chatty, inquisitive and showing off one minute and then shy, sulky and withdrawn the next. I could get overwhelmed easily by my emotions. I felt everything deeply. I misbehaved at school sometimes because I felt uncomfortable in certain social situations and reacted badly when I wanted people to see or un-see me. As a teenager, I was melancholic, very interested in alternative music, dress and humour. I could be rude,angryand irritable – usually when triggered by an emotion or environment I couldn’t cope well with or by people I felt were devoid of empathy and who I couldn’t connect with. Feeling things deeply meant I probably cared too much about people and things and was very thoughtful and analytical. Things affected me more than other people, I saw everything intensely. I obsessed with achieving. I took things very seriously. I didn’t want to fail at anything. I struggled with my identity and fitting in and my thinking was very black and white. I’d get very annoyed when people disagreed with me and I took things very personally. I had low self-esteem, but I also had a lot of ideas and things I wanted to say and give to the world. I was too shy to reach any sort of potential. I left sports teams because I couldn’t handle being with people I felt uncomfortable around and who didn’t understand me. I froze at a school guitar concert because I was crippled with the fear of everyone watching me. Because I found it hard to cope emotionally at school, I was either trying to please people, or spending time isolated and withdrawn hiding in the toilets or the library. Being sensitive, I was a target for bullying and could also get into conflict situations when I misread people’s thoughts towards me. As a young person in my 20s, life still felt intense and things affected me. My emotional instability damaged my relationships. My lifestyle at university was not conducive to the best, happiest version of me. I wasself-destructiveand excessive. My social status mattered too much. Later in my 20s, I finally started to make changes. I started to realise I didn’t need to hate myself. That there were lots of positives and strengths to me that I should be proud of. That I was intelligent and had so much potential for good things and good relationships. I realised I could be loved andwatched my relationships improve, reduced myanxiety, and watched myself get stronger. Now, at 29, I feel I have emotional scars that I am aware of, but I am distancing myself from them. I am realising more and more how I only have one life and that I cannot waste it being so affected by other people and how they see me. I cannot live in fear of what people think, of what might happen or not happen. I must believe in myself and love myself otherwise no one else will. This is difficult for me. When self-loathing feels so natural and pessimism has been your reality for so long, breaking free of unhelpful thought patterns is not easy. For me, it feels like I got to a point a few years ago where something had to change in my mind, or I would cease to have a reason to get up in the morning. I realised that even though my tendency is to dwell on the negative, I had to make a conscious, active decision to change. As someone who reacts easily, this is a constant battle. If you don’t know what you are yet, find out. I spent years being a social chameleon. Adapting my clothes, interests, accent, behaviours depending on the social group I was with – to feel less empty and feel more included. It was exhausting and not authentic. I think I had an identity deep down, but I would often mask it in case it didn’t suit the people I was with. I would never feel good after a social event with a bunch of people that, if I was honest with myself, were not my kind of people. I was trying to fit in at the cost of being myself. Ironically, I would have been happier had I cared less. Today, I am always conscious of staying true to myself and accepting that not everyone will like me and that’s fine. As Kurt Cobain once said ‘‘I’d rather be hated for who I am than loved for someone I am not.’’ I have observed that the people who seem most content in life are those who say and act as they want to (within reason) without worrying about how they will be perceived. People respect people who are genuine. People want to be around people who are confident in who they are. It is inspiring and liberating. I am trying to be my authentic self in all social situations now. This is difficult. But if you tell yourself it doesn’t matter and that it’s better to be yourself, then this will become your default. I also tell myself it’s ok if people disagree with me, it doesn’t mean they don’t like me or that I look stupid. Happiness comes from within and I’ve really learned that if I am unhappy with myself, I am unhappy in general. Fundamentally, I have had to learn to like myself in order to be happy. Loving myself still takes work, but self-awareness about the negative voice in your head and how you beat yourself up with it is a good start to noticing how irrational our inner critic can be and how it clouds our experience of reality. Liking yourself andself-carego hand-in-hand. Younger,self-destructiveme hated myself and as a result, did not take care of myself. I put most people before myself and based my happiness on being accepted and liked by others. Ironically, I was the least likeable version of myself because I lacked positivity, confidence and happiness. I have had to learn how to look after myself, moderatedrinking,eating, andsmoking, startexercising, take time for myself and learn and develop skills. I have learnt to be okay with my own thoughts and company and realised I am loveable and worthy. Only now with self-care embedded in my life and learning to accept myself am I able to be stable, secure, positive and happy. My younger self was a person who felt like the world was ending if something I tried to control ended in disaster, or something I tried to prevent happened, or some material thing I placed too much value in was ruined or lost. I would play a victim role, thinking that I had terrible luck, that I didn’t deserve the bad thing that had happened, that life was so unfair. But this wasn’t the case, I just wasn’t accepting that uncertainty and misfortune are natural parts of life and that how we choose to react to these bad things is the only thing we can control and the only thing that matters. Younger me had irrational fears about something terrible happening to me - a plane crash, a false accusation, a terminal illness, a social humiliation. A greater sense of calm for me has come with accepting that any of these things might happen and I can’t live in fear of them happening. When you stop seeing yourself and your life as overly important, driven by your ego and societal expectations, you are a lot more present and grateful for life as it happens now and you come to realise that nothing is permanent and life events or material possessions or relationships do not define you. You become less disappointed with bad outcomes, you place less emphasis on them, you are more receptive to letting life be and are humbled by your awareness of your insignificance in the vast universe we are a tiny part of. Life takes on more meaning when you live less in your worrying mind and focus on being here now before it’s over. Our brains remember the things we tell ourselves repeatedly, internally or externally. I’ve had to make a conscious decision to be more positive as I’ve got older, something that doesn’t come naturally to me, and more self-aware of when I’m negative. Opting for the positive option challenges your default mindset if this is negative. It can feel unnatural and strange but over time you can rewire your thinking. I’m someone who, when I’m overwhelmed by other people’s actions or behaviour, can impulsively react and make a situation more negative. I’m trying to stop myself from reacting quickly and giving myself time to think and be more mindful in situations where I feelanxious, irritated orstressed. I have learned that choosing to react differently is empowering and brings calm and quiet to a bad situation. I’ve also learned not to take things so personally because I tend to assume people are thinking badly of me or don’t like me without having actual evidence to back it up. Reacting positively to people who intimidate you or who you think don’t like you can turn a situation around. Talking negatively about people when you don’t know what’s going on with them or what their perspective is, creates negative energy and unnecessary drama. If you choose to be positive and accept you don’t have the answers or really know people, then you are cultivatingbetter relationshipsand making your experience of life more positive. Younger me was trying to please everyone and sometimes that meant allowing people to make decisions for me about my career, my house, my degree, my relationships. I now realise it is completely integral to my happiness and mental well-being to make my own decisions, even if they turn out to be wrong, because I must be true to who I am in life and what I believe in. If you allow yourself to make decisions based on what the best outcome for you would be (not the best outcome for others), then in my experience, you feel happier because you don’t harbour any resentment from feeling forced into a situation you don’t want to be in. If you don’t want to go to a social event because it would make you uncomfortable, don’t feel obligated to go. Self-care means not putting yourself in stressful situations to please others. This isn’t selfish, this is protective. Obviously spend time with friends and make the effort because friendships and relationships are important, but your reason for doing something should always be that you want to, not that you feel pressured to. Self-worth and self-esteem tie in very much with a sense of purpose and achievement in life. My life is a lot richer and more interesting now and doing things I enjoy and that I’m good at makes me happy. When I was young and lacking in confidence and direction, I would give up easily and become frustrated when I couldn’t do something. Now I am more patient with myself, and more mindful when I’m doing something. This allows me to get pleasure from it and not put pressure on myself to be the best. I am more aware of the fact that developing a skill or talent is a long process that requires practice and dedication, it doesn’t happen immediately. I have watched myself flourish over time, cultivating a skill little and often. The main thing is to remember to try to live your life authentically, true to your real self, without worrying about what others think and taking all the opportunities you can. This is how I try to live my life now I’m older.

Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. For the first time in 13 years, new statistics about the mental health of children and young people in England have been released byNHS Digital. These new figures shed light on the current level of mental health problems among children and young people, and the factors associated with mental health. I have reviewed the data and here I will highlight some of the most noteworthy trends and findings The last survey, conducted in 2004, found that 1 in 10 children aged 5 to 15 had a mental health disorder (either emotional, behavioural, hyperactive, or other). In the newly released 2017 figures, this has risen to 1 in 9. When we include older children and look at all children and young people aged 5 to 19, we find that 1 in 8 (12.8%) have at least one mental disorder. This change was largely driven by an increase in emotional disorders (includinganxietyanddepression), which for 5- to 15-year-olds rose from 3.9% in 2004 to 5.8% in 2017. Across the whole group of 5- to 19-year olds, around 1 in 12 (8.1%) reported an emotional disorder. The type and frequency of mental health disorders are different across ages and genders and, overall, rates of mental disorders rose with age. Boys were more likely to have a disorder among younger age groups, and girls were more likely to have a disorder among older age groups. For the 17 to 19 age group, nearly 1 in 4young womenhad a disorder, with emotional disorders (particularlyanxiety) being the most commonly reported. It is concerning that, of young women in this age group with a disorder, over half (52.7%) reported that they hadself-harmedorattempted suicide. The proportion of children with emotional and behavioural disorders, broken down by age, gender, and disorder type. Despite so many children needing support, only 1 in 4 young people with a mental disorder reported accessing specialist mental health services in the previous year. Children and young people were much more likely to have accessed informal support sources (such as online support, or from their friends and family), or other forms of professional support (e.g. teachers or primary care professionals). The survey also asked questions about a range of other factors and looked at their relationship to mental health. The figures show what many have been saying for some time: some groups in society are more likely to be affected by mental health disorders. Disorders were more common among children living in lower-income households and children whose parents were in receipt of low-income benefits. Disorders were also more likely among children who had experienced challenging life situations, such as their parents separating or having financial difficulties. Children who had a mental disorder were twice as likely to have been bullied or cyberbullied in the previous year. They were also more likely to report that they had bullied or cyberbullied others, suggesting that both those being bullied, and the bullies themselves, may be in need of targeted support. Young people 14 to 19 years old whoidentified as LGBTQIA+were more likely to have a mental disorder (34.9%) than those who identified as heterosexual (13.2%) Family and social support also had an association with mental health disorders. Rates of disorder were higher for children whose parents had a mental health problem, or who received disability-related income, and for children whose families had the lowest levels of functioning. This was particularly pronounced for very young children (aged 2 to 4). 14.9% of children whose parents had poor mental health had a disorder themselves by the age of 4. Children with a disorder were less likely to participate in school-based or other external clubs (e.g. afterschool clubs, sports, arts, music or drama clubs) and were more likely to report low levels of social support, and smaller social networks. Certain behaviours were also associated with mental health. 11- to 16-year-olds with a disorder were more likely to have tried a cigarette, an e-cigarette, or usedillicit drugs. Social media use was extremely common among young people (95.1% of 11- to 19-year-olds reported using it, and 79.1% reported using it daily), and the overall use of social media was not associated with a mental disorder. However,howsocial media was used did show a relationship. Those with a mental disorder were more likely to use social media every day, use social media for longer periods of time, and were more likely to report that the use of social media had an impact on their mood and/or made them compare themselves to others (particularly the case for young women). These figures illustrate how mental health disorders can occur from early childhood, and that their prevalence increases with age, particularly for young women. This highlights the importance of intervening early to prevent the development of mental health problems. The factors associated with mental health disorders in these statistics point toward environmental and social influences that can act as important risk and protective factors for young people’s mental health. Capitalising on opportunities to provide children with supportive environments early may be key for ensuring good mental health for all children and young people.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/experts-experience-are-invaluable-mental-health-how-exactly,Experts by experience are invaluable in mental health: but how exactly?,"This content discusses eating disorders, personality disorders, anxiety and depression, which some people may find triggering. It seems irrefutable that the perspectives of those who have experienced mental health problems should be indispensable to those making decisions that affect their lives. Experts and professionals have essential skills and knowledge, but most decision-makers would recognise (in theory, at least) that those who have personal experience of living withanxiety,depression,eating disorders,bipolar disorder,psychosis,schizophreniaor other mental health challenges can bring something special and different. But what, exactly, do they bring? As someone with a bipolar diagnosis and a decent CV of 'lived experience' myself, I’m personally very concerned with how to maximise the value that I can bring to my work in the mental health sector. How can I ensure that difficult experiences I’ve had in my life bring benefits to others in the future? How can I turn a negative into a positive? On one level, I’m proud to adopt the current jargon and call myself an 'expert by experience' or 'person with lived experience'. It reinforces my efforts to take control of my story and use it constructively. On another level, however, I find these labels quite othering. Putting my hand up as an 'expert by experience' sets me up as a different category of person (that is, in contrast with people who are not experts by experience). It can obscure the other kinds of expertise I have. It feels very different to be a person with lived experience than to be a person who can put on a lived experience hat: I can take my lived experience hat on and off, and I can put it on without other people knowing I’m doing it. Reflecting on all this, I have been thinking about the different ways that I, or others with lived experience, can contribute our expertise within the mental health sector. Some examples include: I have mapped these in a grid with two axes: gifted versus owned, and disclosed versus anonymous: A 'gifted' experience- the meaning of a 'gifted' experience is largely interpreted by colleagues, experts and others – the person offers it as an example which typically fits a broader narrative which is already carved out by others. The experience often becomes embedded within intellectual property owned by an organisation or expert (such as reports, papers, films and social media feeds). An 'owned' experience- when an experience is 'owned' by the person, the person with lived experience takes a more active part in interpreting what their experience means; for example, by disclosing themselves in a workshop in order to make their point more strongly. Their experience is separated from the intellectual property of others. Full disclosure- the second axis represents the extent to which the person gives 'full disclosure' or maintains 'full anonymity'. Appearing in a film, photo or being a member of a Board of Trustees fully identifies the person as someone with lived experience. Full anonymity- an anonymous reviewer on a paper or piece of content, however, can bring their experience to bear on evaluating work, without disclosing it as their personal experience. From an organisation's point of view, the value that people with lived experience can bring takes on different dimensions depending on whether their contributions are owned or gifted, disclosed or anonymised. Gifted contributions play an essential role, especially as case studies forfundraisingor report writing, and disclosure can be central to ensuring these examples are perceived as authentic and genuine. But owned contributions can also be very valuable, playing a particular role in critical reflection, quality control, challenging assumptions and holding power-holders (including the organisation) to account. Disclosure is not always essential here – it may be that those with lived experience can offer a range of analytic contributions while staying anonymous (or only partially disclosing). Personally, I have found that the majority of the opportunities I have to contribute my lived experience in the mental health sector have fallen in the 'disclosed' quadrant of the matrix, and I have been asked to 'gift' more frequently than I have been asked to 'own' my contributions. The power dynamics here are complex, but the pattern of these opportunities raises a question in my mind around whether lived experience is being valued intrinsically (because of the substance of these contributions) or extrinsically (because of the it's simply just seen as 'good' to include these voices). Asking the question of what added value, exactly, we are seeking from a lived experience perspective is crucial for deciding whether we need to request contributions that are owned or gifted, disclosed or anonymous. Lived experience can add different kinds of value in different circumstances – and we should be open and reflective about times when it doesn’t appear to add much value at all. I suspect we would gain deeper, more meaningful value from lived experience contributions by doing this. And by providing a carefully thought out reason why we were asking people to make contributions a particular way, we might also find more people stepping forward to share their insights. Wearing my own lived experience hat, I would say that the best way to honour the hard-won expertise of those who have lived with mental health challenges might be to honestly reflect on what, exactly, we value about it. Both for experts by experience themselves and for the organisations whose work they contribute to, this would be the most invaluable thing of all.

Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. We are delighted to be launching‘How to look after your mental health in prison, a guide for male prisoners’,a new addition to our‘How to Look after your Mental Health’series. Currently in the prison system there is a crisis of unmet mental health needs. The Institute of Psychiatry estimated that: At the Mental Health Foundation, we specialise in public mental healthpolicyandresearch, and co-produce (work with you) initiatives across the life course (from your early to later years) to support people to understand, protect and sustain their mental health. Over the past decade, the Foundation has been a key innovator in the UK on developing and implementingprogrammesfocused onself-management(looking after your own mental health) inpeer support(helping each other) settings. These programmes have used the best available evidence base in their development and have tested and adapted similar approaches in different settings and populations includingschool children,young mums, prisoners andpeople in later life. The booklet was co-produced with prisoners from Parc Prison, Wales. They took part in aself-management programme, run by the Foundation in partnership with G4S, which deliveredpeer supportcourses to vulnerable prisoners at HMP &YOI Parc Bridgend, between October 2013 and December 2016. The expressive, charcoal drawings which illustrate the booklet were made at a creative evaluation workshop for the self-management work. They provide a glimpse into the experience of being in prison and the positive impact the self-management courses had on their mental health. Being in prison, is by intention, a very difficult experience. The environment, the rules and regulations and lack of personal control can all have an impact on prisoner’s mental health. Older prisoners, those with a physical orlearning disabilities, and other vulnerable groups are especially at risk of experiencing poor mental health whilst in prison. The booklet encourages prisoners through ten tips to good mental health in prison to prioritise looking after their mental health. In order to be able to cope better with life in the prison environment, improve wellbeing and build better support networks with family, other inmates and professionals who can help. The booklet is also available in a summary version for people with poor literacy skills. We are hoping to co-produce additional booklets in the future to be part of addressing all prisoners’ mental health needs, includingwomenprisoners, people withlearning difficultiesandpeople in later life, to better manage their mental health in prison.

The events in the USA around the death of George Floyd have shocked people to the core. Many are feeling and experiencing a sense of profound pain. I wanted to share my own experience andwhy racism and discrimination are so closely interconnected to mental health. For me personally, the events around George Floyd’s death has resulted in tears that continue to flow. I am not the only one feeling this, I know. This weariness is affecting very many people and it's affecting my own ability to work and relate normally with people at the moment. I am of mixed heritage myself: South Asian, half Hindu half Muslim. I know prejudice in 'my own' community and I know racism. My children are of Nigerian mixed heritage. I have two teenagers, a boy and a girl who are already, unfortunately, aware of racism. The distress of these events will be affecting us in many, different ways. People of all backgrounds will be struggling withtraumaand grief. It’s vital we get all the guidance we can and support each other. It took me until the next day to get to the point where I could bring my family together and discuss the events and enquire as to the impact on my children’s mental health. It was dispiriting to hear my son say, ""yeah I'm alright, but nothing is going to change though is it?"". This is the challenge. For me, events in the United States feel acutely personal I know how racism has affected my mental health in so many ways, on so many days. It is also bringing up feelings of fear for my own children's safety and wellbeing. At the moment, I am grateful for lockdown and the restriction on going out. These events have awakened afresh in me to the fact that racism exists in the UK. I want to actively participate in the conversations and actions for change.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/i-feel-frightened-angry-world-outside-my-door-impact-brexit-anxiety,“I feel frightened of the angry world outside my door”: the impact of Brexit anxiety,"This content mentions anxiety, which some people may find triggering. Brexit: a topic that has overwhelmed, fascinated and exhausted people living in the UK more than anything else in recent memory. I’m not sure if I agree with those calling it a Marmite issue. While Brexit can certainly be divisive, it has much more important and far reaching social and economic implications than whether you love or hate a yeast extract spread. Regardless of where we stand on the issue, we know one thing for certain: it’s stressing us out. The survey we ran in March 2019 (close to the first Brexit deadline) revealed that: Our survey also showed that we share these feelingswhether we voted Leave or Remain. We are either exhausted by a mission to overturn the outcome, or demoralised by the delay in fulfilling the promise of the referendum. We have argued with our family, friends and colleagues. We have lost sleep over it. We have engaged in endless political conversations and changed two Prime Ministers over it. We also know that our children are more anxious. They are actively avoiding social activities or having nightmares because ofscary world news. Examples worldwide show us that an unstable political environment can increaseanxietylevels. Research also shows that experiences of conflict in relationships, problems with sleeping and feelings of powerlessness are all associated withhigher levels of distress and poor well-being. We asked our supporters and followers on social media how they felt about Brexit and mental health. Some told us that they are too overwhelmed by their own issues to deal with Brexit. Others have questioned why we want to talk about it when there are so many other important topics. But then others have criticised us for not talking enough about Brexit when it’s consuming the nation’s media and exhausting the nation’s patience. Both views are valid. Now, almost six months on from our last survey, we are again at a crossroads with a new Brexit deadline fast approaching in October. Many of you said you are afraid of what Brexit means for you and your circumstances and that you are struggling to cope as a result. Others were anxious of the rise in levels of polarisation, intolerance and negativity. Someone told me: “I feel frightened of the angry world outside my door”. Regardless of where we stand on Brexit, it shouldn’t be acceptable for any of us to feel like that. As with everything in mental health, we shouldn’t expect Brexit anxiety to affect everyone equally. People who are disproportionately affected include: Some solutions have emerged. We know thatBrexit is likely to impact heavily on farmersand their families. To propose what would work best for them in this time of uncertainty, we are working on research in collaboration with Public Health Wales. A lot of organisations like us are out there - working hard to help reduce the mental health impacts of Brexit. It seems like everyone has been developing their own ways to deal with the 24-hour news cycle. Some of you told me that these varied from ignoring the topic to signing petitions. And from talking to friends togetting better sleep. On the back of this, we have released newtop tips on dealing with Brexit anxiety. We are extremely grateful to our supporters for providing quotes for this guide. Staying informed may be important, but we should also try to notice our limits. Being able to engage with our communities (live or online) in a meaningful way will also be important in the coming months, as will being able to have honestconversations with our children about UK and world news. Brexit talk and anxiety are here to stay. At the Foundation, we will continue to work towards good mental health for all. But for many of us, empowering our voice through community involvement and staying close to friends may be our only possible contribution. And we shouldn’t underestimate just how important this contribution is. If you feel affected by the content you have read, please see ourget helppage for support. Political uncertainty can negatively affect to our mental health. These tips can help to minimise the impact that events have on how we feel. Millions of people in the UK have felt powerless, angry or worried over the last year because of Brexit, according to calculations from our new poll. News is everywhere. In the digital age, it is no longer possible to control the news that we are exposed to, or to shield children from upsetting information. Anxiety is a feeling of unease, worry or fear. We all feel anxious sometimes, but anxiety may be a mental health problem if your feelings are very strong or last long. 7th May 2025

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/reflecting-my-mental-health-work,Reflecting on my mental health at work,"This content mentions anxiety and panic attacks, which some people may find triggering. Last year, we asked our Instagram followershow they look after their mental health at work. Rachel reflects on what this question means to her own life. She offers advice based on her own lived experience. What was most interesting for me to see was that responses were torn between whether to disclose a mental health problem at work or not. Some people felt that whilst this was initially a scary thing to do, it was worthwhile in the long term because reasonable adjustments were made, people were more understanding and they felt more secure at work knowing that there was support for them if they needed. Sadly, other people had had the opposite experience, whereby disclosing had meant that people treated them differently, they felt labelled anddiscriminatedagainst and they felt that their jobs were less secure because of their disclosure. I have worked since I was about 17, before, during and after university. As a teenager, I worked in hotels, restaurants and pubs. At university, I worked at John Lewis and when I graduated, I went back to pub work while I tried to get a graduate job. After a few unpaid internships in the third sector, I got my first paid job in 2013 at NSPCC. Since then, I’ve worked in three other charities. My mental health has varied during my time in work, there have been times where I’ve really struggled and times where I’ve really thrived. For me, so much of how I have felt at work and how well I’ve performed as a result, has been down to the working culture and environment and my relationships with colleagues. In addition,having a supportive manageris essential. One thing that has always mattered to me, regardless of how I’m feeling, is that I am a high achiever and well organised. This is the perfectionism in me and the fact that I have always, since school, been ambitious and wanted to do well. I have noticed over time that this perfectionism can be unhealthy and linked to me having unrealistic standards or giving myself too much of a hard time if I make a mistake. I have had to try to be better at not internalising shame, guilt and self-judgment in situations where I have made a human error or not performed as well as I would have liked. I have noticed that the mood I have previously got into after something has gone wrong has been negative and unhelpful and what I should have felt towards myself instead was compassion and understanding. Sitting at my desk feeling terrible about myself is not conducive to my best performance at work, so learning to forgive our mistakes and realise we’re just humans trying to do our best is essential. Something that I’ve always found challenging as someone who is quite introverted is public speaking. What has been the hardest for me is marrying up my perfectionism with myfearof public speaking, because even though I find public speaking scary, I am passionate and care a lot about my work so feel compelled to speak about things I want to influence or change. This makes it impossible for me to just sit back and listen because I want to have a positive input and offer my opinion. Even though I don’t have to go to serious meetings very often in my role, when it does happen it really affects me and I get verystressedin the lead up to them. As a Grants Manager for the Mental Health Foundation, I am responsible for funder meetings and stewarding funders at events. The best way for me to manage my anxiety in these situations is be well prepared. I’ve always overprepared for meetings so that I can mitigate the impact of something going wrong as much as possible, and so I can feel as confident as possible (with an easily triggered amygdala that is always sparking my fight or flight response prematurely). Being well prepared and not being too hard on yourself is important when managing your mental health in meetings. I don’t put too much pressure on myself to speak in a big meeting if I don’t need to, and I let myself leave a meeting (if I am able to) if myanxietyreaches a certain level. This hasn’t happened yet, but knowing that I can do this if I need to makes my brain relax. I think it’s always worth telling your colleagues if you’re afraid of public speaking, so that they know that at some point you may need to take a break or leave a situation if something gets too much. This isn’t possible in every meeting, but in situations where it is possible, then knowing you have that option to politely leave if you need to is a comfort and something most reasonable people will understand. Public speaking gets easier over time and if you know the material you are speaking about, then this should be enough to reassure you and help you try to relax beforehand. Having worked in a few different work environments now, something that I find essential to good mental health at work is an empowering culture. Atoxic work culture, to me, is a culture that is hierarchical, siloed and fear inspired – where people blame and shame each other and staff (especially junior staff) are afraid to put a foot wrong. It is a culture wheremanagers criticise and micromanage, rather than praise, support and trust those they line manage. It encourages division, cliques and bullying, and is sometimes very subtle and hard to prove (especially if it is coming from someone who is well-established and senior in the organisation). Unfortunately, I experienced a toxic working environment in a previous job where I was bullied. Because the person bullying me was my manager and fairly influential in their role, it was very difficult to prove that the way they managed was damaging and inappropriate. They were also good at manipulating situations and opinions in their favour. They would behave totally differently around others in the organisation, so it was not obvious how my teammates and I were being unhealthily assessed and micromanaged. But for all those who were managed by them, it got to a point where we didn’t want to come into work, and instead of thriving in our roles we were making mistakes simply because we were terrified and constantly attacked or criticised. With toxic cultures and management, it is important that you take action to address them, to help protect your mental health. This sometimes takes courage and decisiveness - and will depend on what is right for each individual. For me in my old job, it meant making a complaint to HR about my manager and officially challenging my appraisal decision. At first, I felt like I had no one on side, but eventually others also complained, and HR could see that there was a pattern emerging that they could not ignore. Eventually, my manager had all managerial responsibilities taken off them and was assigned a new role. This happened after I had already left the organisation unfortunately, but at least it happened. If action is not being taken quickly enough or you feel powerless because people don’t see what you see, then you may want to proactively find a new job. Try not place blame on yourself and notice if it is starting to impact affect your self-esteem. You could try to seek out something healthier and ask about workplace culture when you go for interviews to try and mitigate finding yourself in another toxic one! If possible, surround yourself as much as possible with supportive colleagues at work, people who understand you and you can confide in. Taking a break from your computer and work generally is essential for wellbeing, physical and mental health. Sitting down for eight hours a day is apparently taking years off our life and giving us a slower metabolism and dry eye syndrome, amongst other things. But in addition to the physical effects, our brains are working in overdrive and never getting peace. So, I try to take little breaks as much as I can, to walk around, do stretches and make hot drinks, and I try to get outside over lunch. There is a danger that we make ourselves ill if we don’t take breaks and there is so much more to life than just working. We need to have awork-life balance. I really value my life outside of work and I am fortunate that I can leave on time most days. I try to keep work life and home life separate as much as possible, as it’s integral to my wellbeing that I have other interests and projects to concentrate on outside of my job. I think it’s important that we all have hobbies and things that we like to do outside out of work, even if that is just reading or relaxing. I will avoid taking work home with me as much as possible. Something that inevitably happens at work is that we get stressed and sometimes thisstresscan be overwhelming. Sometimes, when we are stressed we can overact or lash out and upset others without meaning to. This is something I have been guilty of at times and then I feel terrible afterwards. The best thing to try to do to avoid getting to an unbearable level of stress is to take preventative measures in the form ofself-careas much as possible, to avoid reacting in a way you later regret. For me, this means being organised with my workload, being prepared and managing my time effectively. It means taking regular breaks, it means avoiding toxicity where possible and it means appropriately speaking up for myself and saying how I feel. Internalising feelings and avoiding situations instead of confronting them can make things worse and lead to underlying tension and stress that hangs over you. In order to feel calm at work, I never minimise something that has affected me or avoid saying something I need to say or doing something I need to do. I give these things the attention they need. It also helps to manage stress outside of work time. For me, this meansexercising,eating well, moderatingdrinkingandsleepingwell. Keeping a healthy body helps keep a healthy mind. I’m unable to function properly at work if my body feels unwell and I’m rundown or hungover or sleep deprived. We need to be kind to ourselves as much as possible and give ourselves the best chance to be well and thriving at work. If stress andanxietyget too much at work and you can’t cope, speak to someone you trust about it and take some time off. This isn’t a weakness this is healing. I’ve hadpanic attacksin the office before and what has been so helpful for me has been non-judgemental, supportive colleagues sitting with me, listening and letting me have space. I also found that regularmeditationhelped control the anxiety and stopped the attacks altogether. To conclude, give yourself the best chance of mental wellness and success at work by being organised and prepared, not being too hard on yourself if something goes wrong, removing yourself from toxic environments, reporting bullying or harassment, taking breaks and managing stress and anxiety with prevention in mind.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/stress-are-we-coping,Stress - are we coping?,"This content mentions anxiety, depression and trauma, which some people may find triggering. Mental Health Awareness Weekis a time to ask big questions. Here is a BIG question that keeps me awake at night: what is the single greatest thing we could do toprevent mental health problems? Many of you reading this will have gone through periods of mental ill-health or walked through it with the person you love most. I know I have. And that's why there is an urgency to find answers. I think this generation has a window of opportunity to call for change and to discover a new way forward. As a species, we've been around for 200,000 years. For most of that time, mental health has not been on our radar. Too busy surviving. But we are starting to understand that mental health is essential to make life worth surviving. We will find out just how many of us are living with high levels ofstressand what the triggers are. If we are anything like our friends in the USA, the findings could be troubling -Many Americans Stressed about Future of Our Nation, New APA Stress in America™ Survey Reveals. Our message? We can't afford to under-estimate stress or avoid making the changes needed for a less toxic approach to living. In this blog, I want to explain why. Stress is not a mental health problem itself. The stress response is a survival strategy to keep us safe. It was a vital adaption when looking to survive being eaten on the savannah. Humans won the evolutionary game of thrones because when we sensed threat or danger, our amygdala (the part of our brain controlling emotions like fear andanxiety) switched on like a light. When that happens, the brain shuts down any unnecessary functions and hormones, like cortisol, and floods the blood with glucose, giving a power surge to the body’s muscles to respond in two ways: flight or fight. The social scientist Michael Marmot describes stress as what happens when we can't control what is happening to us. And today, our brain cannot distinguish between a lion’s menacing presence and the affront of a rude person who pushes past you in the queue. The physiological response is the same. Many of us are triggering our stress response repeatedly every day – day in, day out. It leads to what the experts call theallostatic overload. Instead of out-witting the lion and then retreating to a nearby cave, repeated stressful events is like being chased all day by a lion on repeat. Sound like one of your days? It turns out that this is very bad for us. It makes us sick. Researchers at theYale Stress Centerfound that when stress becomes a way of life - rushing from pillar to post (reading emails as you fly past) - the prefrontal cortex part of our brain begins to shut down and even reduces in size. The prefrontal cortex is the most recently evolved part of our brains – it regulates our amygdala, blood pressure and heart beat but also enables us to learn, plan, concentrate and make judgements. Chronic stress increases our risk of addictive and destructive behaviour, of developinganxiety,depressionand other mental health problems. It can also increase risks of physical health problems including heart disease,insomnia, muscle pain and damages our immune system...the list goes on. Stress has also been linked to cancer, both through increasing inflammation in the body whichcan aid in the spread of cancer, andthrough greater risk of central obesity. Interestingly, it is our perception of stress in our lives added to actual stressful event that predicts its impact on us. We also know that exposure to trauma will produce long-term effects.A summary of the available evidenceby Professor Mark Edwards in Mental Elf recently found that the stress of emotional neglect is a causal factor behind the development of a condition called functional neurological disorder. In other words,if you can prevent the stressful event, you can prevent the onset of ill-health. In one of life's bitter ironies, our stress response - which has done so much to keep us alive - now threatens to drastically reduce the quality of our lives. The type of society we live in affects our mental health. The less frenetic, the kinder, fairer and more creative, the better for human flourishing. I was staggered to read Brigid Schulte's assertion in her excellent bookOverwhelmedthat, every second, the world's email users are writing the equivalent of 16,000 copies of the complete works of Shakespeare. Never before in the course of human history has so much information been spewed in our direction. When the demand for our attention outstrips the supply of time, stress is the result. What is equally alarming is that stress does not fall equally among us. Marmot's famous study of the health of the UK civil service found that health outcomes improved at every level as you went up the hierarchy.Status Syndromedebunks the myth that it is tough at the top. Marmot demonstrates that power and resources protect you from stress and its impact. The lower your place on the social hierarchy, the more vulnerable you are to the impact of stress. In fact, you can plot a person’s life expectancy by using the postcode of where somewhere lives. Talk about a postcode lottery. 21st-century life holds many opportunities for us. Life will always have its challenges and no-one wants to go back to living in caves. But unless we step back and find alternative approaches to a life of repeated stressful events, we can’t expect the tide of poor mental health to turn.

Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. We are calling on the government, councils and the NHS to use our newsuicide prevention resource mapto support mentally healthier communities. Our researchers joined forces with the Zero Suicide Alliance to mapsuiciderisks across England’s regions and local authority areas. We created the map by comparing rates ofpoverty, bullying and nine other risks associated withsuicidal thoughts, attempts and completions. People can see how their region and local authority area compares as part of an effort to drive awareness and actions to reduce risks. The map links to an accompanying document setting out evidence-based and informed actions to reduce all 11 of the risks we have identified. Primarily using thePublic Health England Fingertips Suicide Prevention Profileswe then collated scores for these 11 indicators and then used the composite numbers to compare risk between England’s nine regions and then between local authorities within each region. These 11 indicators have one factor common to all:povertyis the most important risk and drives worse outcomes in all categories including overall suicide rates.If you as an individual, organisation or tier of government take only one action from the many suggested below do everything you can to ‘level up’ the most deprived. Actions suggested include supporting the creation of more genuinely Living Wage jobs, using public sector budgets to buy more local goods and services and providing better welfare advice. TheCOVID-19 crisis is causing significant economic harm, increased alcohol use, trauma and domestic abuse – problems reflected in the risks we have mapped and therefore, if anything, their relevance has been heightened. Suggested actions, based on a literature review of evidence-based and informed interventions, are principally aimed at local and central government and NHS bodies, but everyone can have a role to play in making them happen.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/why-now-not-time-stop-raising-awareness-about-mental-health,Why now is not the time to stop raising awareness about mental health,"Raising awareness of any health issue is the crucial first step towards ensuring that people take action to improve their health and reduce the risk of becoming ill. This is the case with cancer,smoking, heart disease, HIV and diabetes. These conditions require focused attention topreventthem, in which we can all play a part once we are well-informed. They also need early detection so that treatment has the best chance of success. It should not be any different for mental health. Official figures show that61% of mental health problems go untreated. Many people do not even seek treatment for problems – withmen significantly less likely than womento ask for help. The involvement of public figures and members of the Royal family in combatting thestigmaof mental ill-health and encouraging people to realise that there are steps they can take when their mental health is deteriorating has been a great help in overcoming this. Others only get treatment when they reach crisis point. This reduces the chance of a fully successfulrecovery, causes substantial costs to people's lives and sometimes costs people's lives themselves. The demand on services is a failure to respond to need and act early, and is a failure to provide prevention and timely help in primary care. It’s not a result of too much awareness as Simon Wessely has suggested. Every time we have a Mental Health Awareness Week, my spirits sink. We don’t need people to be more aware. We can’t deal with the ones who already are aware. - Sir Simon Wessely, President of the Royal Society of Medicine, in the British Medical Journal Mental health problems are the great public health challenge of our time:two in three of us have experienced a mental health problem in our lifetime. Now is the time to give people the information they need and to equip all those public services, families and communities, who can do so much to protect mental health and prevent problems escalating into crisis. The answers cannot be about doing more of the same. We can’t deal with mental health problems through a massive increase in highly specialised services – that is neither cost effective nor what people need. We need to focus on awareness and information for everyone onhow to look after our mental healthandpreventative and early interventionsupport in our communities, particularly where we know more people are likely to experience mental ill-health. Mental health problems are not inevitable. We have a moral duty to act much earlier and this can only be achieved if people themselves recognise that things can be different. This will not happen by us all keeping quiet to spare the services from demand. It can only be achieved if people themselves recognise that things can and should be different. We will gain nothing by putting mental health back in a box marked ‘too much’, ‘too difficult’ or ‘undeserving’. This is where mental health languished for years, with the result that people of all ages suffered in silence, often experiencing shame,stigma and discrimination. We wouldn’t discourage a man who found a lump on his testicle or a woman who discovered a lump on her breast from seeing the doctor, purely because our health services are under pressure. We shouldn’t do so for mental health problems either. Awareness has an important role in turning this around, but action must always follow, and is just as important. When we do experience poor mental health, we need the attitudes we hold as a society, and the actions we have taken, to enable us to feel we can seek help. We need to be confident this will be accepted, and that we, or our sister, brother, mother, father or friend, will be listened to and receive a caring, appropriate response. We need answers, and earlier. Silence is not one of them. We won't stop raising awareness about mental health. Only with awareness can we get the UK thriving with good mental health.

Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. It would be odd to think that you could go through life without ever becoming physically unwell. Be that a nasty cold at one end of the spectrum through to life-limiting conditions at the other. However, when werevealedduringMental Health Awareness Weekthat a majority of people (nearly 2 in 3) reported that they had experienced a mental health problem in their lifetime, there was a backlash from some. Documented by Paul Gallagher iniNews, professional contrarians Piers Morgan and Brendon O’Neill called for the return of the ""stiff upper lip"" and the Head of Lifestyle Economics at the Institute of Economic Affairs claimed there was ""an epidemic of over-diagnosis"". The statistic was secured via credible methodology through an authoritative survey conducted byNatCen Social Research, who also produce the British Social Attitudes Survey and official mental health statistics for government. Nevertheless, one swallow does not make a summer. In research terms, it is the collation of evidence from different sources that breeds confidence in a conclusion. Which is why a recent blog in Scientific American entitled ""mental illness is far more common than we know"" is so important. Citing new research, it sets out ""that almost everyone will develop at least one diagnosable mental disorder at some point in their lives"" and that ""most of these people will never receive treatment, and their relationships, job performance and life satisfaction will likely suffer"". Understandably, this makes some people feel uncomfortable. To date, the statistic of choice in mental health (in England) has been that1 in 4 peopleare likely to experience a common mental health problem in any given year. In time, I am confident that the fact that nearly two thirds of people will be directly affected by mental health problems across a lifetime will be cited more often than the 1 in 4 statistic. Subconsciously, the 1 in 4 statistic creates a kind of ‘offering’ – we can feel compassion for those affected but are able to draw a sigh of relief by imagining that this applies to other people and not us. Scary enough to prod action in some, but not scary enough to reinforce the need for widespread change. That most of us are likely to experience a mental health problem shouldn’t be such a shock to the system. Like physical health, we all have mental health, and mental health problems range in severity. From common problems likeanxiety disorders, which many people can self-manage with support, to severe problems like psychosis, which require dedicated help and treatment. However, increasing awareness of the widespread impact of mental health problems will have implications. Regardless of whether it is one person or a million, those experiencing severe mental health problems are entitled to and deserve access to care and treatment at the point of need. Beyond this, however, there will need to be a growing focus onpreventionand equipping people with the skills and knowledge to understand, protect and sustain good mental health. Where possible,prevention is better than cure. The blog in Scientific American flags the need for greater health screening for mental health problems. This was one of our five asks to government duringMental Health Awareness Week. For example, we routinely screen men in their early 40s for high blood pressure, but we don’t ask them about their mental and emotional health. This is despite men in this age range being atgreater risk of death by suicidethan by heart disease. Another key conclusion is that we need to get better at identifying and addressing the causes of mental ill-health. One of the key reasons we are living longer, physically healthier lives is because public health pioneers located and eradicated the drivers of ill-health. On which, the authors of the Scientific American blog, Aaron Reuben and Jonathan Schaefer, raise another important implication: that there is much we can learn from the much smaller percentage of people who go through life never experiencing a mental health problem. What is different about them, their environment and experiences, which enable them to escape the impact of mental ill-health? In research terms, this is known as positive deviance ""the observation that in any community there are people whose uncommon but successful behaviours or strategies enable them to find better solutions to a problem than their peers"". If we stop assuming that good mental health throughout a lifetime is the norm we can get a much sharper idea of why those who are fortunate with their mental health are able to stay well. Recognising the scale of the mental health crisis might be the very thing that brings about its solution.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/happy-birthday-nhs,"Happy Birthday, NHS","This content mentions depression and self-harm. Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. In an article for the British Journal of Psychiatry on the 50th anniversary of the NHS, the then-President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, Robert Kendell, suggested that it was ""easy to forget, in the face of our present difficulties and discontents, that psychiatric services have improved out of all recognition in the past 50 years."" On its 65th anniversary, this sentiment still rings true. The regimented tyranny of the old asylums is a thing of the past – what we have to offer people with mental health problems today is often (though sadly not always) world-class. In 1948, mental healthcare for those with serious disorders was largely provided in more than 100 asylums dotted around the countryside or suburbs. These had 145,000 residents. Out of sight was out of mind. There was minimal independent supervision of standards of care, while treatments were limited and - to our modern sensibilities - pretty barbaric. The 1950 Ministry of Health report set out the various treatments available in hospital. It highlighted therapeutic convulsion treatment (""a potent weapon for cutting short depressive illness""), insulin shock treatment (""particularly valuable"" in the treatment ofschizophrenia) and prefrontal leucotomy – cutting out part of the brain (believed to have a ""usefulness"" in ""properly selected cases""). Outpatient clinics or other forms of community support were few and far between. Those with less serious problems generally made do as best they could in family settings. Yet mental health services nearly did not make it into the NHS. The Chief Medical Officer's report of 1946, which looked forward to its creation, made no mention of mental health, and some politicians argued that it should be the preserve of local authorities rather than the NHS. The eventual decision to include mental health services was hugely important in bringing psychiatry into the broader family of medical disciplines, legitimising its professional aspirations and establishing mental hospitals and staff within the same operational framework as other health services. The most evident change in the provision of specialist mental health services over the past 60 years has been the move from treatment in hospital to treatment in the community. The mental hospital population has fallen from 145,779 in 1948 in England and Wales to some 33,000 today. The number of patients resident as certified or formally detained in hospital under the Mental Health Act has plummeted from 123,464 in 1948 to 17,500 in England in 2012. A range of factors has been cited for this change. Newmedicationthat better controlled symptoms of mental illness allowed many patients to be discharged. The increasing cost of inpatient care turned politicians' thoughts towards cheaper community care. The Percy Commission of 1957 highlighted concerns about hospital conditions and occasional hospital scandals hit the headlines through the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Socialpolicydeveloped a more libertarian view of mental illness and new welfare benefits enabled people to survive in the community, even if they were not capable of work. However, there were no overnight changes. For many years after 1948, life in mental hospitals continued much as before, with bed numbers peaking at over 150,000 in the mid-1950s. Asylums only started to close in any numbers in the late 1970s and early 1980s, although many had by then transferred some patients to general hospital psychiatric wards or to the community. Alternative community services were prompted by new legislation setting out local authority responsibilities of care. The Mental Health Act 1959 gave impetus to local authorities to develop a range of community support such as group homes and day centres for those who did not need hospital care. In 1961, at a conference of the National Organisation for Mental Health (later Mind), the then Health Minister Enoch Powell spoke passionately against the grim isolated asylums ""brooded over by the gigantic water-tower and chimney combined"". This speech cemented the shift in focus from asylum to general hospital and community care, and the 1975 white paper 'Better Services for the Mentally Ill' led to more day hospitals, day centres, residential homes, hostels and community nursing provision. Sadly, the rhetoric of community care was not backed up by adequate NHS or local authority resources. Progress was slow and public perceptions of its failings were formed by occasional high-profile incidents involving care in the community patients, which continue to this day. But community services were boosted by the NHS and Community Care Act 1990, which provided a backdrop for multidisciplinary community mental health teams and the care programme approach, which gave some patients an assessment, a care plan and a key worker. Despite this, implementation was inconsistent. An attempt to address these inconsistencies was behind the Labour Government’s generally admirable programme for modernising mental health services between 2000 and 2010. This involved a national service framework for mental health and specific service provision targets overseen by a National Institute for Mental Health, all driven from the centre by a national director. Importantly, all this was backed by significant new money. Those days may be over, now that we have had a recession that we are still struggling to get out of. It is hard to see much, if any, new money being put into mental health services for some time to come. There have been radical improvements since 1948. There are clear mental health strategies in place across all four parts of the UK. Much is now accepted that would have seemed very strange to our predecessors in 1948 – personalisation, patient-centred care, therecoverymodel,talking therapies,peer support, best practice on effective interventions set out in national guidance from NICE. In addition the mental health workforce has expanded and achieved greater professional recognition. The patient voice is growing stronger, and is often properly represented and effective in influencing national and local levels of service. Treatments are more humane and care standards are better monitored. We know the various factors that can lead to mental illness but diagnosis, and offering the right intervention, can be an inexact science. Prevalence rates remain obstinately high. Not enough resource is spent on improving public mental health and preventing mental disorders from arising. Too many people still wait too long for appropriate support, or fall between gaps in uncoordinated services. Many people with mental disorders also experience very poor mental health, which can be addressed, but often isn’t. Services are cash-strapped, many with limited access for patients. Reports of overcrowding, poor environment and staff shortages in hospitals are common to both 1948 and 2013. Legislation remains focused on compulsion rather than rights. New Community Treatment Orders have increased the overall number of people under compulsory powers of the mental Health Act, at least in England. Thestigmaattached to mental illness remains and public attitudes and behaviour are often negative. And we are faced today and in the future with new challenges, such as the increasing numbers of patients withsubstance misuse problems, high levels of diagnosed disorders among someBlack and minority ethnic communitiesandrefugee and asylum seekercommunities, an increase in the numbers of young people recorded asself-harming, and an ageing population with significant levels ofdepressionand, due to longevity, creating adementia""time bomb"". A 65th birthday should be a time of celebration. We should rightly applaud the advances made in mental health services the past 65 years and recognise the contribution of the thousands of NHS, local authority and voluntary sector staff who have been - and remain - committed to caring for people with mental health needs. But we still experience many of the ""difficulties and discontents"" that Robert Kendell spoke of 15 years ago. To progress, we must take public mental health more seriously; develop more effective interventions and new ways of integrated working across a range health, social care and other services; and, perhaps most importantly, listen harder to people who experience mental health difficulties to learn what they want in the way of support.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/coping-anger,Coping with anger,"Rachel talks through her personal experiences of coping with anger and shares her tips with you. Last year we asked our Instagram followers, ‘what do you do to cope when you feel angry?’. Some followers dealt with their anger in unhealthy ways such as binge eating, acting out, internalising bad feelings and breaking things. Others had more healthy responses like exercising in moderation or going outside for fresh air, listening to music, writing or drawing to express themselves. As someone who is both highly sensitive and who struggles with regulating my emotions,anger is one of the feelings I find hardest to contain. It is something that I have not coped well with in the past and something I must constantly work on in everyday life. Being highly sensitive is a physical trait that Dr Elaine Aron in her book ‘The Highly Sensitive Person’ says affects about 15% to 20% of the population. It means you have a higher-than-average sensitivity to the sights, sounds, emotional cues, and other stimuli around you. This can include external stimuli, like your surroundings and the people you’re with, or internal stimuli, like your own thoughts, emotions and realisations. In everyday life this means you tend to feel things more deeply than others seem to, are easily overwhelmed by loud, crowded spaces and hectic environments, and sometimes need to just withdraw and be alone. There are positives to being highly sensitive, such as intuition, empathy, creativity and awareness of others’ needs, but the negatives are overwhelm, exhaustion and burnout. In my case, this overload can turn to irritation andimpulsive angry outbursts, especially when I feel like I am a ‘victim’ of inconsiderate behaviour in public or my home environment. This has got me in unpleasant situations with neighbours, people on public transport, people at concerts, bars and in other crowded spaces. Coupled with my high sensitivity, and perhaps caused in part by it, is my emotion dysregulation, or emotional instability. Emotion dysregulation is a lack of ability to manage the intensity and duration of negative emotions, like fear, sadness and anger, in a way that is considered acceptable. i.e. you struggle to moderate your emotions, and this can lead to impulsive outbursts and aggression towards yourself or others. For me, as a child and teenager, it often meant social withdrawal or avoidance, crying, sulking and lack of flexibility around change. It could also manifest as bad or antisocial behaviour - screaming and shouting in an explosive rage at parents, defying teachers and others in authority, answering back, impulsive rudeness and school detentions. Nowadays, I am a lot more self-aware than I was as a child and young person, more mellow and better at managing my emotional instability and my high sensitivity, but there are still situations where I am negatively triggered, and the emotion that comes out in the most ‘socially unacceptable’ way for me, is anger. Coping with anger as a sensitive person who struggles with emotional instability is a constant challenge. There are things that I have learnt over the years that have helped me, but I know that this is still my area of weakness. Emotion dysregulation can feel like having an exposed nerve ending or being in the eye of an emotional storm. Often it feels hopeless trying to manage anger when you seem naturally predisposed to outbursts. Self-awareness and a greater understanding of what is going on in my brain and how my life experiences and sensitivity have impacted me has led me to feel more compassion towards myself than I did when I was younger. Therapyhas also helped me validate my feelings and thoughts, when perhaps they were dismissed (and not always intentionally) in my younger years by parents, teachers or peers. When thoughts and feelings are ignored, dismissed or even ridiculed this can result in feelings of injustice, shame and self-loathing, and this is what may trigger dysregulated emotions like anger. Having someone validate the way you feel or think in a situation and not make you feel strange or odd about that, can be a positive step in being able to think or act differently in the future. Not having our feelings validated may even lead us to resist changing our behaviour. When people show empathy, you can be much more likely to be receptive to their suggestions. For me having a therapist say to me, ‘‘I can understand why you would have reacted like that in that situation, that must have been really frustrating for you’’ is the validation I have needed to try to improve my behaviour. It is also realising that every human being is flawed and makes mistakes, and you are not a terrible person. One thing that may lead to feelings of invalidation is feeling like you are unable to express your feelings or opinions because you are afraid of how others will react. This may be because there’s been a history of them not validating your views before. I was often afraid of stating my view as a child and young person so I’d let a feeling boil up inside me, which would then come out in a dysregulated way later e.g. in an anger or crying outburst. To avoid feeling anger and resentment for not being able to express myself when I want to, I see if I can express myself in that moment in a non-angry way. I can be assertive without letting this turn into an argument. I know that if I am tired, frustrated, stressed, hungry or upset, I am more like to be easily triggered by an anger-provoking situation. I’ve found it helpful to try to prevent angry outbursts by ensuring I get enough sleep, nutritious food and regular exercise to regulate my emotions. As someone who likes to be in control to the extent that I sometimes get involved in things I needn’t be involved in, I can find my capacity is nearly full most of the time – which is why it’s so easy for me to react in outbursts. I’ve learnt the importance of making time to relax and enjoy things. You cannot be on the go all the time and stay emotionally regulated – not just in your 9-5 job but also working on side projects, as I often am. Your body needs space to do nothing and be calm. To play as well as work. You could also take the time to think and reflect on what situations may make you more vulnerable to anger and protect yourself from them in the future. For instance, for me, I have taken the time to realise that I am triggered by crowded, loud, chaotic places and people who are acting in a way that I find selfish or inconsiderate. I need time alone to recharge and recover after overstimulating situations. I also prefer individual or small group interactions where I feel more secure and validated, so I limit the amount of time I spend in large group situations. As a child or young person, being overwhelmed in large group situations could lead me to sulk or withdraw. This behaviour on the outside may appear to others to be childish or passive-aggressive, but inside I was feeling extremely uncomfortable, upset and sometimes desperate to get out of that situation. I used to feel hopeless about my anger and easy irritation with things. Thinking that was just the way I was, and I couldn’t ever change it. I used to feel immense amounts of shame after an episode of emotion dysregulation, almost feeling horrified by the person I had momentarily become. Mindfulness (meditation)was my saviour in 2014 when I took an eight-week course after work and experienced for the first time, without drugs, a state of complete and utter peace, still and calm.Mindfulness is available to all of us. There are apps for it, there are YouTube videos for it and there are courses for it. I can’t recommend it enough. People who feel hopelessly trapped in an anger cycle need to feel they can change, and mindfulness can provide that hope for some. Something else that helps take the edge off my emotional dysregulation, sensitivity and tendency towards anger, is medication. I take the smallest possible dose of myantidepressant. This allows me to absorb more serotonin, the brain’s happy chemical and allows me to tend less towards irritation and negative feelings. When it comes to medication for your mental health it is important to seek advice from a professional, whether it beyour GP, psychiatrist, or community pharmacy before you go onto it, change it, or reduce it. I have also been seeing a psychotherapist for many months now, and she has been invaluable to me. She has helped me to understand why I am dysregulated, what steps I can take to become less so, and for the first time has allowed me to feel properly validated, self-confident and understood. This has enabled me to remove a lot of the shame, low self-esteem and self-loathing from my life which all contribute to my anger outbursts. Having someone to talk to who understands you, either a trained therapist, or just an empathetic, non-judgemental friend may help to mitigate the emotional turmoil going on inside if you are someone that tends towards dysregulated angry outbursts. Therapists can help to mentalise what is going on in your life and why you behave a certain way, offer insight and perspective and recommend coping strategies and long-term behavioural change. I’ve realised as I’ve got older that when I’ve got into heated arguments with family members or others close to me, it’s sometimes been because I’ve been too personally involved in the debate and unable to step back and see it from the other person’s perspective. I struggled growing up with assimilating my identity with the thing I was defending, whether a rock band, famous person or political view. I felt offended if people didn’t agree with me about something because I felt my fragile identity was attacked. To avoid heated situations with someone with opposing views, I’ve learnt the hard way that taking a breath and pausing before reacting and not taking on the role of trying to overprotect the thing you are defending, is key. Rows with people can fracture relationships. If you are unable to calmly state your view, then it may be best to try to ignore what is being said or leave the situation politely until you feel calmer. Debates that start off being about a political view or opinion can soon turn into a personal argument if people feel attacked. This is unpleasant for all involved. I’ve had to swallow my pride and learn some humility. Anger management courses can often teach people to stop before they speak. This is of course easier said than done for people who are easily triggered but practising mindfulness (bringing yourself into the present and not running away with your thoughts or feelings) may help. Sometimes people can feel hurt or offended by how we’ve behaved towards them, and we should also be willing to listen to them and try to understand how they feel, not get defensive and invalidate them as this will exacerbate ill-feeling and not lead to a resolution in the relationship. So many people findexpressing their anger in creative waysor letting off steam through exercise helpful. Doing an activity, whether creative or sporty, can be a way to distract your mind from the anger you feel, and a way of positively channelling and removing the stress hormones that anger generates. For me, personally, I use art to regulate my emotions. I love to paint abstract art. My art is simply what comes out of my head and onto a canvas. It is therapeutic and it distracts me. It also gives me a sense of pride and achievement, to replace the negative emotions that anger fills me with. When you’re emotionally dysregulated, an emotion that most people would feel for a short time becomes a mood that can last the whole day. Your behaviour can be very mood dependent. When I’m feeling particularly angry or frustrated, there are certain songs I listen to that help me get that anger or frustration out. I love rock and metal; I also love techno and electronic music. Dancing in a club to music or listening to music loudly after a stressful day, can be the medicine that I need. It’s also essential that I always have access to music in public, to stop me from getting angry and irritated by loud sounds. At night when I’m trying to sleep, I also use earplugs, so I’m not frustrated by a neighbour or street noise. If I’m feeling down or fed up, sometimes I play the guitar and sing, to express the emotions I need to express. Music is cathartic because the people writing it are often expressing their feelings. Being able to connect to people’s words and songs is powerful and can help you to process your own feelings. I also like to write to get my frustrations out. I write poems or blogs to express how I feel. But I have to steer clear of getting into angry debates on social media about issues that I care about, as this almost never makes me feel better, and almost always gets me into a horrible conflict situation which makes me feel even worse. If you’re really angry about an issue in the news, then you could consider having some time away from it. You could have a break from TV or/and social media or unfollow accounts or news sources that may trigger feelings of anger in you. This might seem like an obvious one, but it’s something that has helped me mellow out over the years. Sometimes my anger and frustration are caused by an underlying fear that I can’t control things – humans destroying the environment, the way people feel about me, my relationships, people being selfish and inconsiderate in public, the high cost of living, injustice and inequality in society etc. Sometimes letting go is what you need to do to let the anger dissipate. My anger and arguments with others have often stemmed from my ideals not marrying up with reality. My positives are altruism, leadership and reliability, but I can sometimes feel easily let down and disappointed because I can be overly idealistic or too selfless and too sensitive. This can lead me to be angrier with the way things are and more motivated to change things than the average person. I tend to be someone who wants to sort everything out and can exhaust myself by doing so. I have had to force myself to relax more, not put too much pressure on myself and not expect too much from others. I’ve also had to be more accepting of the fact, with the help of therapy, that there’s only so much I can do to help the causes I care about and not feel guilty. I’ve also had to accept that a lot of people don’t think or act in the same way as me and I may care more about things. Being more tolerant in distressing situations, accepting that you can’t change the world on your own, you can just do what you can and that it’s ok to just do nothing sometimes, has helped me enormously. As I’ve grown older, I’ve become more sensible with things like money, accommodation and career choices, and lifestyle choices, to feel more in control and less overwhelmed in the world. I’m as organised as I can possibly be as this limits my stress levels, and when something goes wrong now, I try to be present and rational in my response and accept that it will be fine, rather than going to my old default place of anger, fear and irritation. If you can realise that some of your anger might be down to a fear of losing control, recognise that this is what’s happening and try to teach yourself to put things in perspective more this may help you. You can’t control what happens to you, only how you respond to it. Ultimately, we all feel anger in our lives. It is normal and nothing to be ashamed of. How we choose to channel our anger is the most important thing. Use your anger to fuel creative expression, lobby for positive change, write words that will inspire people, make changes to your circumstances that would make you happier and avoid trigger situations. Take time for yourself, be mindful, breathe, get to know your anger and its triggers and know that in time, with work, you can be in better control of it. This booklet outlines how anger works and explains the benefits of keeping your anger level under control or expressing it in a constructive way. This report is about problem anger, how it affects individuals, families and communities and what we can do to minimise the harm it causes. 11th Sep 2025

There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. Most people know that engaging in physical activity is not only important for our physical health, but also our mental well-being. Much of the existing research focuses on the impact of physical activity on depression, with multiple studies finding thatphysical activityis associated with a reduction indepressivesymptoms. TheRoyal College of Psychiatristsstates that a moderate level of exercise can be as good asantidepressantsorcognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). The relationship between physical activity and mental health appears to work both ways1, with increased physical activity resulting in better mental health and vice versa. Not surprisingly, then,those with severe mental health problems are less likely to engage in physical activity and are more likely to be physically unwell. The evidence for the positive effects of exercise on a range of mental health problems is growing, with studies demonstrating that exercise can improve the lives of people withschizophrenia.2Despite this, exercise interventions are often neglected in mental health care3and the mortality gap for people with serious mental health problems continues to widen. This is particularly pernicious in Northern Ireland, a country in which the recent political turmoil has exacerbated the mental health crisis to catastrophic proportions. The Mental Health Foundation, along with several partners, including Queen’s University Belfast, Praxis Care, Platinum Training Institute and three Recovery Colleges (Northern Recovery College, South Eastern Recovery College and Western Recovery College), has received funding from DRILL (Disability Research on Independent Living & Learning) to conduct a one-year pilot study to address the high levels of physical ill-health and preventable deaths of people with serious mental health problems in Northern Ireland. Co-production will inform the entire study. Individuals with lived experience of psychosocial difficulties will receive training from Queen’s University Belfast to become peer researchers on this study. They will then have an instrumental role in co-producing the programme design, research methodology, analysis, research findings recommendations and promotion. The physical exercise programme, targeted at people with a range of serious mental health problems, will be developed from a series of co-production workshops with people with lived experience, and consultations with recovery colleges, sports organisations and health professionals. Participants will undergo tailored health checks to determine the programme's impact on participants' physical and mental health measures. The sustainability of the programme will be explored via interviews and consultations with partners, and recommendations and next steps will be identified. The shocking fact that more people in Northern Ireland havedied by suicidein the past 18 years than were killed during 30 years of conflict highlights the urgency of the situation. Mental health problems can no longer be ignored, and innovative, creative approaches and solutions should be explored. This is exactly what we seek to do with our partners through this large-scale physical exercise programme designed to empower people with serious mental health problems to incorporate physical activity into their lives. Not only does this innovative study seek to develop the evidence base for physical exercise interventions in mental health, but it also hopes to provide practical solutions that will improve the delivery of services in Northern Ireland.

      / Challenging mental health inequalities The government has released the latest data about mental illness and treatment across the population in England. It confirms that more people than ever are struggling with their mental health - and they are not making it up. This content is tagged with: Home of Mental Health Awareness Week"
https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/how-mental-health-days-could-improve-uks-mental-health,How mental health days could improve the UK's mental health,"ForMental Health Awareness Week, we've looked at what we can do to make ourselves less stressed, and we can all do something. But governments in the UK also need to step up and take a leading role in helping to improve our collective mental health by tackling chronic stress. Mental Health Awareness Week has been about action since 2001 and each year we call on policymakers to take concrete steps to support good mental health and ensure the policy is not undermining the nation's mental health. One of our key asks is for governments to introduce a minimum of two mental health days for every public sector worker. This would help the people who help us when we are most in need to stay mentally well at times when the pressure threatens to affect their mental health. Our recent YouGov survey of 4,619 adults aged over 18 showed that a third of us (32%) get stressed by thinking about work in our personal time, 23% of us compromise our health to get work done and 16% compromise relationships. This is terrible for our mental health: somestressis normal (indeed essential) for all of us, but when it becomes constant and overwhelming it can cause us problems that can affect every aspect of our lives. Stress isn’t a mental health problem in itself, but it is linked to depression, anxiety, self-harm and suicide, as well as physical health problems such as cardiovascular disease. We know thatstaying physically healthy is good for our mental health, as is spending timedeveloping positive relationships. So how would mental health days for public sector workers help? It is clear from recent reports that our nurses, doctors, police officers and school staff are under increasing pressure, in part due to measures to reduce costs across the public sector and also due to the changing demands of public sector jobs – an ageing population and cybercrime. We certainly wouldn’t say this is the whole answer to this challenge, but by rolling out mental health days, we can help public sector workers better look after their mental health when they start to feel overwhelmed. By incentivising their use when needed, it will give people a chance to do things for their own mental health, whether that be spending a day with their family or friends or doing a hobby. We have a similar system in place at the Mental Health Foundation, where everyone gets three ‘well-being days’ each year. The idea is that, if starting to feel stressed and bogged down in work (which we all can from time to time), people take a day for themselves and come back the next day feeling refreshed and ready to go again. Some will question the loss of productivity from the two mental health days but it’s actually likely to lead to an improvement in productivity.  It would also send a powerful message to people that their mental well-being is important, and can be combined with other ways to support people’s mental well-being in the workplace, such as providing good line management and ensuring people take breaks and use their holiday entitlements. The Office for National Statistics says that stress and other mental health problems are the fourth highest cause of sickness absence. But our survey suggested that it’s likely that this is underestimated, as 45% of people will make up an alternative reason for absence, rather than report a mental health issue to their employer. In addition, our survey found that 28% of us feel less productive than we could be at work because of stress. When you put all that evidence together, it’s a lot of lost productivity. Of course, private and third sector workers also experience stress which can become overwhelming and lead to mental health problems. We would like to see the practice of mental health days picked up more broadly However, reducing the stress of the public sector workforce will benefit us all and we know that the government in Westminster has committed to leading on workplace well-being in the public sector, as part of its response to the Thriving at Work report. We believe that this is a tangible step that can be taken to increase and support mutual learning and sharing of good employment practices between public, private and third-sector employers. Action to tackle chronic stress needs to be multi-faceted: there is no one simple solution to the challenges posed by our survey.  Some of the answer is helping people to manage and reduce the stress they experience, but we also need a collective, societal response. In addition to our call for mental health days for public sector workers, we have  six other policy asks of governments to help make the UK a less stressed nation: More research is needed on the prevalence of stress in the population, and on how the experience of stress can be reduced at the community and societal level. Working conditions and environment can have a huge impact on mental health and, equally, someone's mental health can have a significant impact to perform well in their job. This guide provides you with tips on how to look after your mental health at work. Good mental health at work and good management go hand in hand and there is strong evidence that workplaces with high levels of mental wellbeing are more productive. Addressing wellbeing at work increases productivity by as much as 12%. 7th May 2025

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/preventing-mental-health-problems-children-more-important-ever,Preventing mental health problems in children is more important than ever,"I am delighted to have joined the Mental Health Foundation as Programme Lead for the Families, Children and Young People's (FCYP) programme. I hope to be able to draw on my experience in managing Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS), previous project management experience and my ongoing practice as an adult psychotherapist and clinical supervisor, to build on the success ofexisting FCYP projectsand to develop new areas of work. Now is a particularly exciting time to be joining the Foundation because of its commitment topreventionand the leadership role it continues to play in this field. Most importantly, effective prevention avoids the considerable distress that mental ill-health causes children and their families and ensures that young people can plan for their future with hope, not fear. With 1 in 10 school-age children currently having a diagnosable mental health problem, the need foran effective prevention strategyis greater than ever. As well as alleviating distress, it would reduce pressure on overstretched services and be a positive investment in the future mental health of the nation. We know that half of all adult mental health problems start by the age of 14, and 75% by the age of 18. It’s hard to think of a more compelling case for prioritisingprevention! I am keen to work with colleagues across the Foundation to build on the success of existing projects. For example, thePeer Education Project (PEP)has gone from strength to strength, with over  8,000 students taking part in 2017/18. We are considering whether the model might be further expanded as well as extended to other parts of the school community, such as parents and teachers, or adapted for primary schools. Similar plans are underway to build on the success of theYoung Mums Togetherproject, for example devising an intervention to support young men approaching fatherhood, as well as some innovative ideas for helping families during the crucial perinatal period. As well as the more 'universal'preventionapproaches (designed for all young people) such as PEP, I want to ensure that we think about groups of children who may be particularly vulnerable to mental health difficulties. For example, there is a growing awareness that manyyoung peoplewho are drawn towards gangs and/or youth violence also share risk factors for poor mental health, such as adverse childhood experiences, social exclusion and living in areas of high deprivation. Similarly, we know that groups such as youngrefugees and asylum seekersand looked-after children are at increased risk and yet not always able to access the support they need early enough. I’m keen to form links with individuals and organisations who are working with these populations to devise effective and appropriate prevention programmes. I am really excited about joining the Mental Health Foundation and leading its families, children and young people programmes in England which grows ever stronger. I look forward to keeping you updated.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/exploring-loneliness-children,Exploring loneliness in children,"This content mentions loneliness or isolation, which some people may find triggering. The ONS has released a significant report today‘Exploring loneliness in children, Great Britain: 2018’, which is an analysis of children’s (aged 10 to 15) reporting oflonelinessand their perception of their circumstances. It's important to remember that loneliness can be a normal part of life if it is transient and not experienced too frequently. However, this report notes that chronic loneliness can have a profoundly negative effect on the health of all ages and can be considered the 'social equivalent of physical pain'. The report points out that there is much more extensive data on the experience of loneliness in older people but comparatively little on the experience in children and young people. We know that the childhood years are a period of particularly intensive growth and development and that frequent and chronic loneliness during this period is likely to have a proportionately greater detrimental effect on a young person's mental well-being. The survey found that over 45% of children asked said they felt lonely 'often' or 'some of the time'. Further research into the link between the experience of loneliness and the development of mental health problems needs to be prioritised. We know that there is a link betweensocial and economic inequalityandpoor physical and mental health. This survey and report provide further evidence of this connection between poverty and emotional well-being, with children living in relativepovertybeing nearly twice as likely to report feeling lonely than those who live above the threshold. Although some of the children interviewed as part of the survey reported that their loneliness was connected to not having the material possessions that other children have (new trainers, phones etc), the report suggests that loneliness linked to relative poverty is more complex than simply not having enough material possessions. Significantly, the report highlights the importance of children's autonomy, defined as the amount of choice they have in life. When this factor is considered, satisfaction with material possessions no longer features as a factor in relation to loneliness. Children who experience low satisfaction with the amount of choice they have in life are 4 times more likely to report feeling lonely than children who report high levels of satisfaction with their autonomy. As would be expected, children who have low contentment with theirrelationshipswith friends are significantly (7 times) more likely to report feeling lonely than those who are content with their relationships. The main adult parent/carer's life satisfaction is significantly associated with children's reporting of loneliness. We very much welcome this report, as we feel that the experience of loneliness amongst children, is likely to have important implications for their emotional well-being and mental health as they grow and develop into the next generation of adults.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/getting-people-thriving-good-mental-health-workplace,Getting people thriving with good mental health in the workplace,"Our new research'Surviving or Thriving? The state of the UK's mental health'shows that most of us experience something we’d describe as a mental health problem at some time. Our research also showed that just 13% of the UK population has a high level of good mental health – that’s too low and it’s time we recognised and addressed the barriers that prevent some people from thriving. Work is a big part of most adults' lives – and therefore our workplaces are a key setting for understanding and addressing our mental health. In our research study 'Added value: mental health as a workplace asset' at the end of 2016, 86% of respondents agreed that their job and being at work were important to protecting and maintaining their mental health – with people who had experienced mental health problems most likely to agree. We believe in workplaces where everyone, regardless of their backstory, can thrive. We believe it is time to turn the argument onworkplace mental healthfrom one of burden and cost to one of recognising the value and the potential gain from protecting and improving mental health at work.The economic argument supports this, with people working with a mental health problem estimated to be responsible for 12.1% of the UK’s GDP – that’s £226 billion in value. This is nine times greater than the still substantial £25 billion cost of lost productivity arising from mental ill-health. We need to be mindful of the cost – but also if we are bottom-line focused, just as concerned with the potential risks of not acting to prevent distress. We know that when our working life supports our ability to thrive, the identity, income and purpose that it brings can be good for our mental health. We also know that challenging working conditions can be toxic to our mental health and we may lose the mental health benefits work can bring. The world of work is changing. In that change and pressure to become leaner, there are hazards for mental health and well-being, and a risk that some people can be left behind. We want to see a labour market that includes everyone who wants to be a part of it, and recognises and addresses challenges before they become toxic. To do that we need to understand and address the causes of mental health problems and ensure that working life both supports good mental health and addresses risk factors. In a recent meta-review, which I reported forThe Mental Elf, Samuel Harvey and colleagues examined the evidence for work-related risk factors for common mental health problems. Based on the ﬁndings of the review, the authors present a new, unifying model of psychosocial risk factors in the workplace - perhaps by pro-actively balancing these factors we can find the levers for creating thriving workplaces. Diagram reproduced from Occup Environ Med, Harvey SB, Modini M, Joyce S, et al, 74:301-310, 2017 with permission from BMJ Publishing Group Ltd. In truth, there is a range of personal, workplace and societal factors that need to be factored into the debate on workplace mental health. But that's like saying that a cake is a blend of eggs, flour and sugar - it's how you bring it all together that matters. At a personal level, we all bring talents and challenges to everything we do in life, including our work. There are a number of evidence-based things we can do to boost our mental health and prepare us for the challenges life throws at us.Improving our sleep, improving ourdiet, ourrelationships, takingmore exerciseand practisingmindfulness- even doing good for others can all help us protect and improve our mental health. Where employers can support and incentivise these activities with employee benefits and time, it is likely that mental health will improve. Even so, we also need to understand that not everybody is able to adopt these strategies without help and support. Today, we are aware of so many examples of employers that have taken steps to address mental health across the business, with outstanding examples such as KPMG UK, who are running over 40 events this week across the UK business and encouraging staff to take 30 minutes out of their working week to do something for their mental health as part of a commitment to mental health in the business. Photo of Chris O'Sullivan on the panel at KPMG's 'Thriving in the workplace' event to mark the start of Mental Health Awareness Week 2017. We have worked with businesses such as Royal Mail Group, who worked with us to create asuite of videos for staff that focused on mental health in a holistic way. We need to celebrate the work that’s happening to create and grow mentally healthy workplaces across the UK. We see the workplace and the position that workplaces have in communities as key to our call for creating a national programme for improving mental health in communities. We also need to do more to understand how we share the learning often forged in large businesses at the cutting edge, with small businesses in which so many of us work. We can talk about talking, and coming forward when you have a problem – but the reality is still that for many people, that isn’t safe or helpful. We must address discrimination at work, and ensure that there are support services that people can access quickly, effectively and without prejudice. If we want to encourage disclosure, there must be a 'disclosure premium', where those of us with lived experience understand that coming forward and bringing our whole selves to work is not going to result in dismissal, discrimination or even destitution. In our recent research report Added Value we asked over 2,000 respondents to list their top priorities for addressing mental health at work - managers and staff, with and without personal experience of mental ill-health. The top three desired actions were the same across the board: Whilst there is a wealth of good evidence on mental health at work, we still have many challenges and unanswered questions. We need to recognise that many people are working in rapidly changing, sometimes hostile environments where the risk of psychological injury is high. We need to recognise that the riskiest jobs for mental health - those with the most demands and the least control, the least reward per effort, and where the organisational justice is negligible are those often occupied by people with the highest risk of mental health problems. We need to know more about the mental health impact of precarious employment, working multiple jobs, or the effect of compulsion on any employment arising from social security policy if we are to understand the role of work in both addressing and perpetuating mental health inequalities. These unexplored factors are key in our call for better mental health research, to help us understand and address the causes of mental ill-health both in work and around work. This week, we’ll be speaking at a number of workplaces about what thriving means to them – and how workplaces can best commit to ensuring that their people are able to thrive when possible. We want to ensure that all workplaces in the UK support good mental health and create environments where their employees can thrive. We need your help to make this happen.

Since August 2019, we have had a partnership between the Mental Health Foundation and Anchor Hanover Housing. The work we have done includes facilitating weekly groups in retirement and extra care housing schemes, with a focus on creativity and getting outdoors. This has included individual and collective drawing and painting, as well as planting flowers and bulbs. Since the lockdown started in the UK in March 2020, we have adapted our delivery to continue engaging people in creative expression during this difficult period of isolation. They have received packs with art materials for drawing, adding colour to images, and documenting different aspects of their experiences. In keeping with this, we are organising One Day in Lockdown to encourage people to document their day creatively, but also capture the ways that they are being kind to themselves. We gave people a template which included outlines of objects that represent four key aspects of many people’s day: a mug (for a cup of tea or coffee), a window (for a view of who or what is passing by); a screen (for what we’ve been watching on television) and a dinner plate (for what we’ve eaten for a meal). To document your day, we asked people to draw and add colour to the template or take photographs of the items shown. Photographs of completed templates or the items themselves were returned directly to MHF or posted to Instagram, Twitter or Facebook with the hashtags #onedayinlockdown #KindnessMatters#MentalHealthAwarenssWeek. The art created by project participants has now been collected in a community and online art exhibition. The exhibition in the community was presented in a series of panels displayed in a shop front window. Below you will find a link to download a template for One Day in Lockdown. It includes outlines of objects that represent four key aspects of many people’s day: a mug (for a cup of tea or coffee), a window (for a view of who or what is passing by); a screen (for what we’ve been watching on television) and a dinner plate (for what we’ve eaten for a meal). Even as there is talk of easing or lifting lockdown restrictions, many people will remain at home out of choice or necessity. Our Creating Communities Project will be participating by completing these One Day in Lockdown drawings, as will students and teachers who are involved in our Peer Education Project (PEP) at MHF. We hope this can be an opportunity for some intergeneration conversations between grandparents and grandchildren about things that keep them going during lockdown.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/effect-coronavirus-pandemic-refugees-lives,Effect of the coronavirus pandemic on refugees' lives,"This content discusses discrimination or discriminatory violence (such as homophobia, racism, sexism and ableism), trauma and loneliness or isolation, which some people may find triggering. We have become accustomed to the words ‘unprecedented’ and ‘uncertainty’ when describing the effect, that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on our life. The lockdown has certainly disrupted our work, education andrelationships with others. Inevitably, this is challenging our mental health and well-being, more so forasylum seekers and refugeesin our communities, who constantly live in uncertain conditions. These are resilient people, many of whom have experienced unimaginabletraumaand have seenmajor disruptionsin their life. Being forced to flee everything they knew (country, language and culture) to seek safety and to re-establish a sense of normalcy elsewhere in unfamiliar settings. They have also faced the lockdown far away from their loved ones, with high levels of anxiety and concern for their families and friends, affected by the global pandemic in far away and very challenging environments. Sadly, this experience is more likely to amplify further the existing mental health problems faced by asylum seekers and refugees related to their ‘pre-migration experiences and post migration conditions(such as separation from family, difficulties with asylum procedures and poor housing)’. In addition, as we are emerging from lockdown to make sense of ‘our new normal’, we are looking forward to reuniting with and hugging our families, returning to our workplaces and reconnecting with friends in social settings. This may not be possible for many asylum seekers and refugees in the UK. Most don’t have their families and wider social networks around. In addition, asylum seekers are in limbo, not able to take on higher education studies and not allowed to work (with many refugees under or unemployed) and likely to face loneliness or worse, direct discrimination, within their new communities. This compromises their aspirations and jeopardises their sense of purpose, identity and social connections with long term effects on their mental health. The UK has an international legal obligation to protect and support refugees. Within the Mental Health Foundation, through our public mental health prevention approach, we recognise that we must work with refugees to design solutions that protect and support mental health. We are doing this in Scotland in ourVoices and Visibility workwith asylum seekers and refugees, guided by theNew Scots Strategy framework. It is vital to provide affected people and communities a safe space to inform thinking and action at the policy and strategic level. Through a human rights lens, related to the mental health benefits of being connected with your community and influencing policy decisions, we have produced acivic forum awareness video on health, housing and education for asylum seekers. During the lockdown, our volunteers (four women from Syria) wrote letters of kindness to themselves, explaining how being kind has helped them cope during the lockdown. This year, as part ofMental Health Awareness Week, we called for the current immigration policies developed under the ‘hostile environment’ approach to be replaced by policies that are shaped by the values of kindness, fairness and dignity for all to help rebuild trust and recognise the benefits that refugees and asylum seekers bring to our communities. It is true, we are at a crossroads globally and locally. We are still going through challenging times and post the coronavirus outbreak it is likely to be difficult. In these unprecedented times, there is a good opportunity to reflect on what kind of society we want to be and adopt an empathic approach by trying to understand the life of asylum seekers and refugees in our communities, asking ourselves “what would it look like if I lost everything and had to start from scratch?” If you feel affected by the content you have read, please see ourget helppage for support. Human connection and relationships are central to our mental health and wellbeing.

Young fathers face significant and specific challenges which can affect their mental health. In this blog, we'll explore some of them and what we can do about them. One of the specific challenges young fathers often experience isunstable housing and homelessness. Relationship breakdown is more common for young parents than for older parents. For this reason, young fathers' involvement in their child's life can be difficult to sustain despite some fathers' best efforts. Young fathers may have fewer resources than older fathers, often having low-paid or unstable work and lower levels of education. For some fathers,housing, education and employment arrangementswere interrupted when they became a dad. This can impact on their ability to maintain consistent contact with their child, especially if the young parents' relationship breaks down. As if these challenges weren't enough to deal with, media reports and cultural norms depict young fathers as risky, absent or irresponsible. Young fathers also experiencestigmaand negative stereotyping by professional services. Interviews with young fathers described professionals' unhelpful or negative assumptions. Other young dads reported being ignored or overlooked by professionals, such as midwives and health visitors. Such negative assumptions about young fathers are inaccurate. Only 10% of non-resident young fathers lose contact with their child over time. The majority of young fathers want to 'be there' for their child, even if they are not living with their child most of the time. It is important to recognise the benefits of young fathers' contributions to their child’s well-being and healthy development. Greater father involvement is associated with better emotional, social and educational outcomes for the child. Family support services could enhance the father-child relationship by providing support and information at the earliest possible stage in their adjustment to fatherhood. Children experience life-long benefits from fathers’ involvement in their lives, such as an increased ability to handlestressin adulthood. Regardless of living arrangements, resources or employment status, young fathers do have the capacity to provide what is important to their child – time with dad. By spending time together, being emotionally supportive and setting clear boundaries for the child, young fathers can massively benefit their child’s mental health and well-being. If you feel affected by the content you have read, please see ourget helppage for support. Being a parent with a mental illness can be hard. But with the right support, you can be a good parent while managing your mental health. Starting a family is a milestone in many people's lives. It can also be a stressful time and many parents experience mental ill health. Mental ill health of parents can have a negative impact on the development of their children. But this is not always the case. Loneliness is something that we can all experience. However, young parents are at an increased risk of loneliness.

It's where collectively, we celebrate the achievements of women, shine a light on issues that affect them and call for gender parity. This year's theme is #ChooseToChallenge: ""We can all choose to challenge and call out gender bias and inequality. We can all choose to seek out and celebrate women's achievements. Collectively, we can all help create an inclusive world. From challenge comes change, so let's all choose to challenge."" Our report,The mental heath of young women and girls policy briefing' on young women and girls, highlighted that these difficulties do exist, but that, “It is important to recognise the agency that young women and girls have to protect their mental health, to avoid implying that they are ‘helpless victims’ who must simply rely on the actions of others.” Today, we can make an empowered stand as women and girls. This day means so much because we get a chance to raise awareness around these statistics, make a stand and say they shouldn’t be this way, and that it is not the individual's fault. To create momentum for societal and structural change and shine a light on those that have defied the odds and show others that with education and campaigning they can too! International Women's Dayare asking for you to strike the #ChooseToChallenge pose: raise your hand high and show that you commit to choosing to challenge inequality, call out bias, question stereotypes, and help forge an inclusive world. Read more from the International Women's Day organisers In England, around one in five women has a common mental health problem such as anxiety, depression or self-harm. Mental health problems affect both men and women, but not in equal measure. The mental health of young women and girls is deteriorating, and the gap between men and women has widened over recent years. As the evidence section in this paper will show, the last 15 years have seen an unprecedented rise in reported mental health problems amongst young women and girls. We now see their needs reaching crisis levels. In recent years, understanding of trauma has increased significantly. Alongside this has been a growing recognition of the role institutions can play in perpetuating trauma, inadvertently causing further harm to some of the most vulnerable people they work with. Understanding the impact of trauma on women is, therefore, vital for providing effective services. 29th Oct 2025

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/empowering-children-and-young-people-use-internet-mentally-healthy-way,Empowering children and young people to use the internet in a mentally healthy way,"The Mental Health Foundation welcomes the BBC’s development andlaunch of 'Own It', a new app that we believe can contribute significantly towards empowering children and young people to use the internet in a mentally healthy way. It’s very easy to fall into the trap of thinking the internet is all bad or dangerous. But we know there aremany benefits of children and young people going onlineand that the internet offers a wealth of opportunities for education and enrichment. These include everything from connecting with their friends and family via social media, to following online piano lessons and doing research for their homework. Among children aged 12 to 15, the vast majority have a smartphoneaccording to the regulator Ofcom. Even among those aged 8 to 11, more than one third have a smartphone. At the Mental Health Foundation, we believe that empowering children and young people to make healthy choices is more effective than telling them what to do. 'Own It' helps them notice what they’re doing and how they’re feeling - and then make decisions themselves. It’s a bit like a friendly adviser in their phone. The app also encourages children to be more aware of how they’re feeling as they use the internet, including social media. It supports this self-awareness by inviting them to keep a record of their emotions over time. They select the emoticon that best reflects how they are at that moment. They can also use words if they want to. Based on what a child records about how they’re feeling, the app will recommend potentially helpful information for them to look at on the internet. Another example of how 'Own It' works is that if a child is typing a message that seems likely to be hurtful to the recipient, then the app will ask whether they’re sure they really want to say that. We hope that being encouraged to think twice will help make children more aware of how they can affect others, while also reducing the number of hurtful messages that are sent. Online bullying is a significant problem for children and young people. What the app does not do is send personally identifiable information about the child using the phone to anyone else. Neither the BBC nor the child’s parents or guardians will receive any information about a child’s interactions with 'Own It'. The Mental Health Foundation is proud to have supported the launch of 'Own It'. As the BBC says, the app is about “making the internet a kinder place, one message at a time”. To download the app, go to the Apple or Google Play app stores. Mental health problems affect around one in six children. They include depression, anxiety and conduct disorder (a type of behavioural problem), and are often a direct response to what is happening in their lives. Children are increasingly connecting with the world through digital media. With technology constantly changing, it can be hard knowing how to keep your children safe and healthy online. 30th Oct 2025

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/where-next-prevention-mental-health-analysis-2019-general-election-manifestos,Where next for prevention in mental health? An analysis of the 2019 General Election manifestos,"This content mentions anxiety, depression and trauma, which some people may find triggering. Every week in England, one in six adults experiences a common mental health problem, such asanxietyordepression, and, at some point in their lives, one in five adults has considered taking their own life.[1] This level of distress places an unsustainable strain on the NHS and can cause misery in the lives of those affected. As mental health awareness has grown in recent years, so too has our understanding of the factors that can cause problems to develop, and the steps we must take as a society to prevent this from happening. The risk of developing mental health problems is increased by a range of factors, including experiences ofpoverty, inequality,homelessness,violence, unemployment, andtraumatic life events. But mental health can also be protected, for example by good employment practices,financial and housing security, nurturing home environments,positive parentingandfriendships, good education which includes social and emotional learning, and strong social and community connections. Many of these are factors that the next government can seek to influence – by addressing those that increase the risk of poor mental health and building on those that protect good mental health, ultimately preventing mental health problems from developing and improving the mental health of the population.[2] Preventingmental health problems – an area ofpolicyknown as “public mental health” – has historically received little attention, both in terms of policy proposals and funding. Local authorities are responsible for delivering public mental health in their local area, and this is largely funded through the public health grant. The public health grant has been cut by around 4% year-on-year since 2015/16, limiting local authorities’ ability to fund public mental health, especially as spending on mental health already represents a low proportion of overall spending of the grant.[3] The Conservative government recently announced a 1% real terms uplift to the public health grant for 2019/20, signalling a shift away from the recent years of cuts, and public health spending features in several parties’ manifestos, with Labour pledging to invest £1 billion in public health and the Liberal Democrats advocating restoring the public health grant to 2015/16 levels. The Greens also plan to restore local government budgets more generally. We hope to see further detail from all parties on how they will encourage local authorities to prioritise spending on public mental health, which needs to go beyond the Public Health Grant and include a focus in all local authority policies and responsibilities on how they protect or harm mental health. While it is tempting to think of mental health purely as an issue for the Department of Health and Social Care and NHS England, the causes of mental health problems are influenced by policies across government. To name just a few examples: education, housing, employment and benefits, and criminal justice all play a part in both protecting well-being and creating risks to people’s mental health. In this election, each party is taking a different approach to promote good health and well-being across government. The Conservative manifesto includes an ambition to ""tackle the underlying causes of increase in NHS demand, for example via a long-term strategy for empowering people with lifestyle-related conditions such as obesity to live healthier lives"". Although this does not explicitly mention mental health, this ambition likely refers to the Conservative government’sprevention strategy– published for consultation in July this year – which did include some proposals for preventing mental health problems.Our response to that consultation can be read hereand we hope that whichever party forms the next government will include an ambitious prevention strategy in its programme of work. Labour’s cross-government approach to mental health and well-being takes the form of a “Future Generations Well-being Act”. This approach is modelled ona similar law passed in Waleswhich aims to make public organisations consider the long-term impacts of any policy on people’s prosperity and well-being. Labour’s manifesto states that their Act will “target a reduction in health inequalities” by “enshrining health aims in all policies”. The Act would also create a new duty for NHS Agencies to “collaborate with directors of public health”. The Liberal Democrat manifesto presents two cross-government ideas for improving the nation’s well-being. The first is a “National Well-being Strategy” which would put “better health and well-being for all at the heart of government” with “ministers from all departments responsible for implementing the strategy”. The second is a well-being budget, which is modelled onNew Zealand’s new economic approachand, according to the Liberal Democrat manifesto, would mean “basing decisions on what will improve well-being as well as on economic and fiscal indicators”. As part of their cross-government approach to well-being, the Liberal Democrats would appoint a “Minster for Well-being”. There are also cross-government health and well-being policies in other parties’ manifestos. The DUP manifesto commits the party to a “prevention first” approach to mental health with a focus on “building resilience and coping skills”. It also has policies aiming to tackle the impact oftraumaand adverse childhood experiences, two well-known causes of mental health problems. Plaid Cymru’s manifesto pledges to “continue to support whole population approaches towards improving mental health and preventing illness through better education in schools, access to green spaces, and tacklingstigmaand discrimination.” The SNP’s manifesto aspires to ensure that economic growth leads to increased well-being. The Green Party want to move away from GDP as a key measure of economic success and towards indicators that measure human and ecological well-being, such as work/life balance and quality of life, which could incentivise government departments to shift their focus towards well-being. Committed and sustained government action to address the causes of mental health problems and build individual and community resilience to adverse life circumstances is long overdue. This election sees all the major parties proposing policies to tackle the health inequalities which lie at the heart of the current unacceptably high levels of mental ill-health. After the election, it is imperative that the parties remain committed to delivering these policies and reducing these high levels of avoidable mental distress which would be considered unacceptable in any other area of health. Above all, the next government must urgently address the economic and social circumstances that can lead to mental health problems. We will continue to advocate for the policies contained inour own manifestoin which we outline evidence-based ways to help deliver better mental health for all.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/pressure-young-person-am-i-good-enough,Pressure as a young person: am I good enough?,"This content mentions anxiety, panic attacks and depression, which some people may find triggering. Sade, Atheminee and Yana are 17 and have just finished their first year of sixth form. They want to talk to you about the pressures experienced by young people today, in and out of school, and how this impacts mental health. The definition below may not be the one you were looking for, but it is a clear representation of what pressure means to a student. In reality, pressure is continuously being applied to us and gets distributed in both our academic and social life. “Pressure is the continuous physical force applied perpendicular to the surface of an object per unit area over which that force is distributed.” Schools, especially higher-ranked ones, fail to convey the message that “failing” or slower-paced progress does not mean “failure”. We are treated like statistics and we suffer from this complete disregard, and our mental health is affected as a result. This leads to a lack of human connection between students and teachers and makes us feel insignificant. No credit is given to us unless it contributes to some kind of academic success. This elicits a belief that self-worth is defined by intelligence or academic success; this is false. They have heart palpitations and panic attacks and migraines, and they are all so tired. Worst of all, I feel like a hypocrite, because I’m not even sure I could achieve the grades that I am asking them to get. - Teacher This pressure affects our academic performance as we focus on how others see us, rather than how we see ourselves. So now when I sit in a classroom awaiting my grade, my first thought is “I hope no one finds out”, “what if they all think I’m stupid?” or “should I make up an excuse so that I don’t get ridiculed by others?”. It gets to a stage where my only source of motivation is the fear of judgement from both my peers and my teachers. After having studiously sat there adding our grades to their excel spreadsheet, we then feel like we are still tossed aside. As if we end up being a great accomplishment that is left to gather dust on their shelves. Once we leave the education system, our grades remain there, ready to be taken out and used as a trophy, enticing students to join the school. This is a reoccurring mindset that has been influenced onto us by our peers and teachers through the “need to succeed”. This “life-defining” grade draws students away from the vital part of the educational system – LEARNING. As a child we were all at some point intrigued and felt a need to know more; it would bring us joy to go to school and learn about this fascinating world that we live in. Unfortunately, all that beautiful mystery and interest has been smothered by all the pressures we face as students. However, this lack of interest does not just affect our choices during our lessons but also how we respond to future life changing events, i.e. dropping out of school. On average,one in 10 UK undergraduates will  drop out  of university before their second year of study.[1] Currently, learning for many students is becoming a chore that can seem daunting and tedious to complete. This negative mindset is hard to avoid, but the truth is we are much more than that. Despite what we’re conditioned to believe, we are not defined by our grades. The idea behind this overdramatised misconception is extremely damaging to our mental well=being. It’s imperative that we understand it and acknowledge that this as one of the leading causes ofstressand development ofpanic attacks,anxiety,depressionfor young people in school etc. My peers break down in lessons as they are scared of what’s going to happen to them in the future if they fail. - 16-year-old GCSE student Social events are a big element of our lives. It is an opportunity for us to make friends, try new things and ultimately, experience the greatness of life. Yet, this is not our reality. Instead, we find ourselves bombarded with the minor aspects of life, such as worrying about what we wore and whether it was good enough ... or we were too busy thinking about others' opinions. Is this what we should be worrying about? Such thoughts, have unfortunately led us, to miss several opportunities due to the intensefear and anxiety, significantly downgrading our self-esteem. We are at that stage of life where everyone surrounding us isstarting serious relationshipsand thinking about their futures. It radiates self-hatred as we sit there questioning: The topic of “SEX” has developed a negative stigma around younger people. Although many adults resist discussing this topic in detail with younger audiences, this increases our intrigue to discuss it, which can develop into negative opinions. I believe that when discussing this topic, it's extremely important to keep in mind that we are all DIFFERENT. We shouldn’t have to experience judgement as if the event requires a comment page. In many ways, sex is like ‘breathing’ - another normal part of being human. The key difference is how personal something like sex is to an individual. If we are not judged for how we breathe, why should we get judged on how / when we have sex? This causes shame and self-hatred, which both pressure individuals to have sex when they are not ready and ridicule them after having it. The Kaiser study found that boys in particular face pressure to have sex, often from male friends. One in three boys ages 15 to 17 admitted they feel pressure to have sex, compared with 23% of girls.[2] On a final note, make mistakes.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/reflections-children-and-young-peoples-mental-health-green-paper,Reflections on the children and young people’s mental health Green Paper,"There is much to welcome in the Children and Young People’s Green Paper. It's direct commitment to helppreventmental health problems emerging represents a shift in focus looking upstream to tackle the determinants of these problems at their root. The government’s formal recognition of this need is very encouraging and presents new opportunities to shape appropriate measures to safeguard children and young people’s mental health and importantly, reduce the pain of mental distress and improve the quality of the lives of children and young people. Addressing the inequalities associated with risk to mental health involves evolving and adapting our social arrangements and institutions. Public sector responsibilities do not reside solely in the health service and the Green Paper importantly reflects this. Working closely with the Department for Education demonstrates the important role the education setting plays in advancing mental health equity and promoting measures to protect emotional and social well-being. Delays in identifying children at risk and providing effectiveearly interventionmean that many young people enter adulthood with emerging and all too often untreated conditions, while other symptoms may only develop later in adulthood. Schools provide an important setting in which to support good mental health and well-being, equipping young people to progress into adult life as resilient, compassionate and socially engaged citizens. In working to reduce the prevalence of mental health problems, to make the biggest difference, we need to start at the earliest point, focusing a good deal on child development from conception onwards. It is encouraging to see the Green Paper’s pledge to commission further research into interventions that support parents and carers to build and/or improve the quality of attachment relationships with their babies and young children. This reflects the latest evidence that emphasises that the security generated from this parent-child bond is central to a child’s psychological and social development, and one of the building blocks of resilience. It is of the utmost importance that early years work is joined up across government. If viewed in isolation from other policies, there is a danger the Green Paper’s ambitions will not come to fruition. For example, the reduced number of health visitors is of great concern; it is precisely this kind of early support for families that needs to be strengthened. This being said, the Green Paper does make provisions to support the What Works Centres to promote guidance for local areas to encourage evidence-based commissioning of support for parents and carers, and it will recommend that local authorities commission parenting programmes for which there is a good evidence base. However, ‘encouraging’ areas to adopt approaches is not as strong as ensuring that these happen; we need to have the strength of conviction to say that we have to now do things differently for the future of our society. The commitment to evidence-based practice opens new avenues for early intervention which ultimately will help to reduce the high prevalence rates of behavioural and emotional problems that emerge in childhood and can ultimately lead to mental health problems. It will, however, require future investment in testing new and promising practices ‘in flight’, as there are gaps in evidence, particularly in the acceptability and effectiveness for different groups of families and people living in different cultures and contexts (for example,Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME)families, children whose parents have a mental health problem and children in care). Looking to the school setting, it is encouraging to see the Green Paper’s commitment to applying a 'whole-school approach' (an approach that acknowledges the need to engage the whole school community, from pupils to head teachers, school nurses to teaching assistants.) As it stands, the Green Paper enshrines responsibility for mental health in a single individual – the trained mental health lead – rather than taking a more all-encompassing school community-focused approach. There is mention of the role that this mental health lead will play in promoting a whole-school approach, and of course, this leadership will be necessary, but it must run concurrently with a broader, systemic approach, which starts with teacher training. If our teachers are to be the key adult in children’s lives for a good part of each day, they need to understand and be committed to positive child development and to creating mentally healthy and nurturing environments. If rolled out in the wrong way, the proposed approach could potentially result in staff feeling less empowered to engage with the well-being of children and young people, as well as their own well-being. We have seen this happen in a number of different policy areas, such as where there has been an equality lead but no mainstreaming of the approach throughout the whole system. It will also be crucial to ensure that we measure success appropriately and that schools are incentivised to put mental health at the heart of the curriculum, with a successful school being measured first and foremost on the mental health of its pupils, rather than focusing too much on attainment. A mentally healthy child will be better placed to learn and do well in life in many ways that are important. The Green Paper is a welcome and important turning point; we must ensure that its vision is realised and that it does not become a missed opportunity to truly embed mental health prevention across the whole school setting. There is a mounting body of evidence demonstrating that themental health of young women and girlsis deteriorating and that the gap between boys’ and girls’ mental health has widened over recent years. Today, young women are three times more likely than their male counterparts to experience common mental health problems. Importantly, the Green Paper cites a recent BMJ study on the 68% increase in self-harm rates among girls, highlighting this gender-specific mental health concern. However, when it comes to recommendations to address this challenge, the only policy actions which specifically support women are in relation to perinatal care. This Green Paper is a good start for children and young people in general but a gender-sensitive lens also needs to be applied. Equally, it will be important to consider other equality issues to ensure that we address the increased risk of mental health problems associated with factors such asliving with a learning disability,being Black, andmanaging a long-term physical health condition. While further clarity is required on what exactly the government’s commitment to prevention means in policy terms and will look like when implemented, the Green Paper opens up a new chapter in children and young people’s mental health protection and improvement; one that is desperately needed. The paper provides a good reason for optimism and we look forward to working with the government to write this next chapter: establishing new paths and setting out preventative measures to improve mental health support for children and young people. The Mental Health Foundation has responded to a call for evidence issued by the Department of Health and Social Care on the Government’s new strategy to prevent health problems, Advancing our health: Prevention in the 2020s. Here, Michael Hough, the Foundation's Public and Policy Affairs Officer, talks about the effects on mental health and what needs to happen next. 7th May 2025

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/nutrition-and-mental-health-obvious-yet-under-recognised,"Nutrition and mental health: obvious, yet under recognised","This content mentions depression and anxiety, which some people may find triggering. One of the most obvious yet under-recognised factors for mental health isnutrition. What we eat and drink affects how we feel, think and behave. With the recentAdult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (APMS)finding that one in six people have experienced a common mental problem such asanxietyordepressionin the last week, the need for effective approaches to understanding and improving mental health has never been greater. The Mental Health Foundation haspublished a new policy briefingwhich focuses on how nutrition can be effectively integrated into public health strategies to protect and improve mental health and emotional wellbeing. It discusses what we know about the relationship between nutrition and mental health, the risk and positive factors within our diets and proposes an agenda for action. It is common knowledge in the UK that there is a well-established link between diet andphysical health, especially for non-communicable diseases such as type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease and some cancers. Less understood is the contribution made by diet to mental health. This is due in part to the complexity of the relationship, and the need to take into account the effects of other factors. Research has already provided evidence that there is a strong relationship between physical health and mental health, such as the increased incidence ofdepressionin those with heart disease, establishing that there is an indirect link. The evidence is now building about thedirect association between what people eat and how they feel. The role of diet in the nation’s mental health has yet to be fully understood and embraced. The messages about nutrition can appear to be changeable and contradictory, and shifts in policy and practice have been slow to materialise. A general lack of awareness of the evidence base, as well as scepticism about its quality, has limited progress in embracing the role of nutrition in people’s mental health. However, this is beginning to change. The Foundation's message is not that nutrition is a silver bullet for mental health problems, but it does have a part to play inprevention, treatment andrecovery. A good example of this emerging evidence base is a recent randomised controlled trial study called theSMILES trial. It looked at dietary improvement for adults withdepressionand reported positive results for a group who were given a diet intervention in terms of remission criteria. But importantly, the intervention was not just to tell people to eat better, it involved a considerable amount of support from a dietician and resources such asnutrition material and recipes. Some might argue this is too resource-heavy when compared to other treatments available, especially given that it would most likely be a complementary treatment as opposed to a replacement, but given the lack of negative side effects and potential positive side effects to physical health to this type of intervention, it is worth exploring further. (The Mental Elf has published an excellent easy-read summary of this paper,Diet and depression: can we eat our way out of clinical depression? The 'SMILES trial.) We are calling for an integrated mind-body approach to supporting mental health that equally reflects the interplay of biological factors, as well as broader psychological, emotional and social conceptions of mental health, which is vital in order to reduce the prevalence and the distress caused by mental health problems: diet is a cornerstone of this integrated approach. Nutrition is more than the sum of individual choices and behaviours. Public policy is vital to ensuring that healthy food is understood, available and affordable for all, and we have laid out some foundational steps in the briefing's policy recommendations that include increasing nutritional literacy, promotion of community-level schemes that provide access to affordable nutritious foods, training on nutrition for mental health professionals and access to dieticians for mental health teams, among others. It is necessary for individuals, practitioners and policymakers to make sense of the relationship between mental health and diet so we can make informed choices, not only about promoting and maintaining good mental health but also increasing awareness of the potential for poor nutrition to be a factor in stimulating or maintaining poor mental health.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/it-wrong-lie-person-dementia,Is it wrong to lie to a person with dementia?,"This content mentions death or bereavement, which some people may find triggering. We need to give much more consideration to the values we use when supporting andcaringfor people living withdementia, especially as they are a group that can be at high risk for developing wider mental health problems. The Mental Health Foundation has published thereport of the major Inquiry about Truth and Lying in Dementia Care, commissioned and funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. At present, more than 850,000 people are living with dementia in the UK, making it an issue that is likely to affect all of us - either directly or through those we love. Although predominantly a condition that develops inlater life, the Alzheimer’s Society point out that there are around 40,000 people in the UK living with early-onset dementia (before the age of 65). One key element to caring for someone with dementia is the interaction when they experience a different reality from their carer or families, especially as the condition progresses. This is one of the most challenging aspects of the condition and can be particularly difficult to manage by the carer. This means, for example, that someone living with dementia may forget that a loved one has died. What should a carer do if someone living with dementia talks about a deceased loved one as if they are still alive? Tell them the truth, distract them, go along with the conversation or actively lie about the fact the person has died? All of the options have repercussions for the well-being of the person living with dementia and their carer, and the answer is not straightforward. Whilst it wasn’t in our scope to set out an algorithm to apply to deliver the most appropriate response to someone living with dementia with a different experience of reality, we were able to set out a number of key principles that should drive good practice: 1. Experiences of different realities and beliefs are meaningful to a person living with dementia 2. Finding out what experiences of different realities and beliefs mean must be done with an open mind, a flexible, tailored approach and with kindness 3. Responses and interventions start as close to whole-truth-telling as possible 4. Environmental lies should be avoided 5. Responses should be kept consistent across family carers or staff teams 6. What does and does not work should be documented and shared In the parable of the blind men and an elephant, a group of blind men touch an elephant to learn what it is like. However, as each one only feels a different part of the animal they go away with descriptions that are in complete disagreement. For example, one touches its body and thinks it is a wall and another touches its trunk and thinks it is a snake. This story has been used for centuries to illustrate how one’s subjective experience may be true, but that such experiences are inherently limited when they don’t account for other truths. Similarly, in dementia care, we need to respect and work from an individual’s perception of truth. Thus, while the inquiry has not come up with a definitive rule, we did conclude that, all things being equal, we should strive to tell the truth whilst accepting that in certain circumstances to do so would cause psychological harm. The real goal is to ensure that those caring for people with dementia have more time to understand why the reality of someone living with dementia is important to them and to what extent it is an expression of a different unmet need. We hope and expect that this report will help in guiding both carers or practitioners and people with dementia.

Commissioned by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, in 2014 the Mental Health Foundation began an inquiry into our understanding of one of the most challenging aspects of living with dementia, when people with dementia experience a reality or set of beliefs different to those around them.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/cop26-message-our-ceo-mark-rowland,"COP26 - A message from our CEO, Mark Rowland","This content mentions anxiety, which some people may find triggering. COP26 is unarguably the best opportunity we have to change the path of irreversible climate change. The Mental Health Foundation is joining with others to call on world leaders to seize this moment and make bold and ambitious commitments that not only reassure people today but also the current younger generation and those to come. As we proved during ourMental Health Awareness Week, the natural environment is a singular and vital asset in sustaining and protecting our mental health. Nearly two-thirds of us in the UK say being close to nature improves our mood, and research shows that connecting with nature helps reduce feelings of worry, anxiety and stress while boosting positive emotions such as joy and calmness. We all have a role in protecting the environment and tackling climate change as well as working towards good mental health for all. But our leaders and policymakers in all sectors must make historic choices that will not only halt climate change, but also protect our environment, and safeguard our homes and at the same time, our mental health. Mental health and climate change are two of the biggest social challenges of this century. That’s why I was delighted to host aCitizens’ Forumto explore theconnection between climate change and mental health. We feel that a vital part of creating a mentally healthy society means tackling the huge and frightening scale of destruction of our natural world that is made so much more vulnerable by climate chaos. Climate change is a disaster for our planet and it is already having adirect impact on our mental health– with 6 in 10 young people around the world saying climate change is a cause of anxiety and fear. Making progress in addressing both the climate emergency and the mental health crisis goes hand in hand. Firstly, we must takepreventative actionin both cases. We cannot wait for the consequences of global warming to get worse before we move to green energy and a net-zero economic model. The same is true of mental health – we need a preventive approach that reduces the huge emotional toll that poor mental health exacts. Secondly, both are global issues that need global answers. If we are to avert the climate crisis and create a mentally healthy future, small changes will not suffice. We need to understand how we change our society and develop a way of living that doesn’t have an unsustainable toll on our planet or on the quality of our inner lives. We have seen fromour own study through the pandemicthat uncertainty and confusion create anxiety, while a clear plan creates hope. COP26 must reverse decades of dithering and deliver a sustainable plan that gives us all confidence in our future. Hope cannot survive on good intentions. It requires tangible action and progress. Finally, in common with mental health, the consequences of climate change will not be felt equally in society. The poorest, the most vulnerable and those on the margins of society will be disproportionately affected. It is those in the global south who have done the least to create the climate emergency who are already experiencing the effects of extreme weather, failing crops and natural resource diminishment. Similarly in mental health, we knowsocial inequalities drive poor mental health. It is why we find that children from the poorest households are four times more likely to have serious mental health problems than those from the wealthiest. In tackling climate change and seeking better mental health, we must take a social justice approach that does not leave anyone behind. We call on the delegates of COP26 to make sure that all their decisions will effectively tackle climate change, support people through a just transition to net-zero and puts people’s mental health at the centre.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/ending-poverty-and-improving-mental-health,Ending poverty and improving mental health,"Let’s be ambitious about endingpovertyand improving mental health. If we did end poverty, then all of us, not just those who are poor now, would see benefits for our mental health. More unequal societies have a wider gap between the richest and poorest. That leads to worse mental health for everyone in that society. But, as with most things, it is the poorest that suffer the most and the 20% least well-off people in the UK are two to three times more likely to develop mental health problems than the richest 20%. Children and young peopleare particularly vulnerable to the mental health harm caused bypovertyand inequality. It’s one of the reasons we launched itsMake it Count campaignfor children on World Mental Health Day last week. Latest figures show that about 4.5 million UK children, a third of under-18-year-olds, live in poverty. That is 400,000 more than last year and rising as austerity and welfare changes continue to bite. Lacking money to pay for decenthousing, healthy food and drink, warm clothes, gym membership and so on is the most obvious way poverty damages health but there are many more subtle ways mental health is undermined. Two years ago, we produced apowerful report on the effect of both absolute and relative poverty. It confirmed that the harm of economic inequality goes far beyond just not having enough money for the basics of a healthy life. The report underlined that poverty reduces ‘mental bandwidth’ - the capacity of the brain to perform daily functions - the consequence of which is that poorer people tend to make poorer health choices. For example, if you’re worried about finding the money to pay the gas bill and replace your child's worn-out school shoes, you are less likely to have the ‘mental bandwidth’ to plan a healthy dinner and you are more likely to grab a cheap takeaway. You are also more likely tosmokeanddrink harmfully, and take other risks that harm the health of you and your children. It’s one of the reasons that children living in poverty are much more likely to experience abuse, neglect, violence and other adverse childhood events which, in turn, make mental illness more likely. Not only does an unequal society push poor people into making poor choices but it also increases the amount of adrenal stress hormone cortisol, our ‘flight or fight’ response, created by everyone living in it. The greater the gap between the rich and poor, the more all of us worry about our status, the more cortisol we produce and the worse our mental and physical health becomes. Some people claim that unequal societies are just the product of ‘human nature’ and that we are ‘hard wired’ to look after number one and that there will always be and always have been ‘winners and losers’. But as Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett point out in their new book 'The Inner Level', the human species has spent 90% of its existence living in hunter-gatherer bands where people were basically equal in status. It is only in the last 12,000 years of agricultural and then industrial societies that have created such disparities and even then some highly affluent and successful societies like Japan and Scandinavia are far more equal and healthy than others. On the positive side, huge strides have been made in reducing absolute poverty across the world in recent decades and the average standard of living has continued to rise despite the fallout from the economic downturn since 2008. The challenge now, recognised by the World Bank (among others not usually noted for their altruism), is to address inequalities, the gap between the richest and poorest, and reduce relative poverty. Initiatives like the Living Wage, Fair Trade and cutting pay ratios all have a role to play but ultimately ‘social transfers’ are necessary to fairly tax wealth and redistribute resources to the poorest. Without such measures, wealth will become more and more concentrated, a situation that is highly unstable as we have seen from recent political events, and our communities will continue to be unequally exposed to fundamental risks to their mental health. There is a close link between poverty and mental health: poverty can be a cause or consequence of mental ill health. A growing body of evidence, mainly from high-income countries, has shown that there is a strong socioeconomic gradient in mental health, with people of lower socioeconomic status having a higher likelihood of developing and experiencing mental health problems. 29th Oct 2025

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/finding-therapist-works-you,Finding a therapist that works for you,"This content mentions sexual assault, trauma, depression, anxiety, panic attacks and loneliness or isolation, which some people may find triggering. Over the past 10 years, I have had numerous different therapists and different types of talking therapies. Like all relationships, with some I clicked with and we lasted the full duration, and others we didn't, and the therapeutic relationship was cut short. Finding the 'right' therapist let alone the 'right'type of therapycan be ananxiety-provokingtask, an overwhelming experience and one in which you can get lost in webpages and overloaded with information. With this blog, I hope to show you that this is a normal feeling and that it is worth persevering and finding what works for you, as we all have a right to good mental health. So, my journey into therapy started in my second year ofuniversity. I didn't know I had 'mental health problems' but I was aware that I seemed to struggle with things in a way that my friends didn't. I had worried throughout secondary school about my stomach rumbling and other children laughing at this. After needing the toilet on a long coach trip and feeling sick with panic the whole way back, I didn't want to travel on long journeys anymore. I used to check all the rooms in the house about five times throughout the night to make sure no one had broken in. I wanted all the mirrors removed from my room after hearing ghost stories…these are just a few examples of how my anxiety leapt from one topic to the next, slowly limiting my life bit by bit. My school, my family and I did not understand what was going on and did not know how to recognise indicators of mental health problems. This meant we unintentionally only dealt with the surface issue: my visible distress. We colluded with my distress by adding locks to front doors when I was scared, keeping me out of assembly so my stomach-rumbling fear wouldn't come true and allowing me to avoid school trips, so as not to get panicked on the journey. Although these solutions were caring and well-intentioned, they actually made my anxieties continue and get worse. I wasn't learning how to cope on my own or challenge these thoughts. This meant that when I started university, I was still experiencing all theseanxieties, but now in an even worse environment as my core support network was no longer there. I missed numerous seminars and lectures due to the tummy-rumbling anxiety, which undermined my confidence and led to low self-esteem. I felt I couldn't cope on my own, and the guilt and stress from this led to a 'breakdown' in my second year. The 'breakdown' was one of my darkest times, in which I experienced adissociative panic attack(where the mind shuts down due tooverwhelming stressand you feel disconnected from your mind, body and surroundings) followed by three months of spirallingdepressionand acuteanxiety, where I wanted to take my own life. However, I truly believe the 'breakdown' saved me, because the only thing left to do, was to reach out, say that I was scared, and get help. So that is what I did… I called a friend and told my housemates that I didn't know what was happening, but I think I've 'gone mad and the men in straight jackets are going to need to take me away'. My mum then arranged private emergency therapy with a psychologist back in my home town (on her small wage!) and a school friend drove up to get me and take me home. My recovery started there. I remember sitting in the room with the psychologist wondering how I got here and whether he was going to lock me away. I felt vulnerable and scared. What unfolded was far from the nightmare in my head. We built a brilliant therapeutic relationship, in which he helped me get out of crisis. He showed me that anxiety and intrusive thoughts are common, he gave me techniques to challenge them, and after six weeks of seeing him two times a week, alongside school friends' support, 24-hour care from my mum, and patience from my partner at the time, I got out of the darkest bit and returned to university to complete my second year. At my worst, my favourite bit of the day was going to sleep as then I didn't have to experience life trapped in this living hell. I would wake up and want to be dead, and I couldn't walk to university without having a panic attack. I waslonely, isolated and terrified. Therapy allowed me to start challenging these thoughts, sit with the strong anxiety and tell myself it would pass, and very slowly, at a snail's pace get myself back to seminars and lectures. The recovery process was long. I needed both professional support and personal commitment towards getting better. This included a determined attitude and daily practice. It was hard and, some days, still is. But, from everything I've learnt, I now have this immense toolkit in my head that just keeps getting bigger, and an insight into myself that helps me be more compassionate. My life is now filled with empathy, and I have a passion to help anyone experiencing mental health problems. I wouldn't take away any of the hard times, as I truly have changed and grown with each experience. This has been a 10-year process, and it will continue to be one for the rest of my life. I see my mental health, like I see my physical health, something that needs daily little acts of kindness and goodness to keep me on track. I saw a cognitive behavioural therapist for seven months on the NHS. We built a brilliant therapeutic relationship. He helped me to really tackle my intrusive thoughts through cognitive and behavioural exposure and I still use what he taught me today. This introduced me to psychotherapy in a structured way. It was a combination of insight into my childhood and learnt patterns and gave me tangible solutions to break and change these. That year with my therapist was one of the most transformative of my life and I refer to what I learnt still on a weekly basis. I have had two lots ofsexual violence-informed trauma therapythrough the NHS and charities. This brought a new level of peace, compassion, self-kindness and self-forgiveness to my life. I felt significantly softer, less angry and more content after this. Once again, it was truly transformative. I connected with both of my therapists. With the first trauma therapist, we both cried at the end; tears of joy for the process we had gone through together. With the second we went away with a sense of pride at how much I had grown and become more assertive. Healing with other women that had experienced similar traumas was incredibly rewarding. I will take their stories and strength with me for the rest of my life. Learning with others helped to keep me motivated. This has brought knowledge of healthy relationships and the importance of personal boundaries into my life. All of us, including the therapist, had a slight tear of joy at the end, due to the process we had gone through together. In the autumn, I am due to start a year-long journey with a trauma-informed psychotherapist. The initial assessment went well, and we already have a great therapeutic relationship. I am certain she is the right therapist for me, and she is certain it is the right therapy for me. It will be difficult, and very emotional, but it will take the important whole-life approach, to deal with the trauma I've experienced over the past four years and allow me to let it go. These are just a few examples of the wide variety of talking therapies available out there, and how, now with digital mental health, the choices are getting even bigger. Some of the examples above were NHS and some were private. This isn't about becoming dependent ontalking therapies(I have had many periods without therapy), it is about knowing when to ask for help, and that you have a right to help. I hope my journey has helped you, and I send you all my love and support for yours. You can speak to your GP, who can help to determine what type of therapy may be most useful for you and refer you. Alternatively, you can refer yourself directly to a therapy service. Therapy services offered by the NHS are free and there are also private therapy services available. You may wish to look for a therapist that is registered with a professional body. You can look for registered therapists in your area on theBritish Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) website. It may also be worth exploring charities or third-sector organisations, as some offer free or low-cost talking therapies, for example: Please see our page ontalking therapiesfor more information.

By now, we’ve all heard about the cost-of-living crisis, and many of us are already feeling the pinch. To make things worse, it looks like it's going to continue for a while. Choices between “heating and eating” and keeping on top of all the household bills and all the other things we have to pay for show no signs of letting up. And it’s starting to have severe effects on our mental health. The first thing is to try not to bottle up your feelings. It can help take the heat out of things by chatting with someone you trust, like a family member or best friend. They probably have similar feelings, and it’s true to say that “a problem shared is a problem halved.” It’s the not knowing that really increases ourstressandanxiety. Not only about how we’re going to pay the bills next week, but through to next year. The stress and anxiety can quickly lead to uncontrolled low moods and, for some of us, more severedepressionandpanic attacks. If you’re starting to feel these symptoms,the first call should be your GP, and sooner rather than later. One of the main things that can add to our stress and anxiety is that pile of bills in the corner of the room. We know it won’t go away on its own, but we can sometimes be too frightened even to open the envelope! Make sure that you’re getting any benefits you’re entitled to. There may be help that you don’t even know about, so a call to your localCitizens Advice(in England, Wales or Scotland) orAdvice NI(in Northern Ireland) is a good first step. Yourlocal councilwill be able to help advise you too, and make sure to look at the government’s ‘Help for households' information, as well as cost-of-living information from the devolved governments inScotland,WalesandNorthern Ireland. Your local council may also be able to help with emergency grants or loans. These are much more affordable and sensitively managed than your existing debts. Getting a realistic idea about your income and outgoings can also help to get a perspective on your finances. Try writing everything down to get a true picture of where you are with things. This will also be really useful when you’re talking with Citizens Advice, for example. Better than trying to remember everything, and it's just a good idea to see it all organised on paper. You could also try using a budgeting app to help get a better idea of your finances. There are lots of these available from your app provider. Just search for 'budgeting apps'.Citizens Advice online can also help with working out your budget. We’re all seeing the cost of food rising, and the people experiencing this more than others are those of us on lower incomes who end up having to spend more on food as a percentage of income. Together with the cost of housing and energy, those of us who spend most of our time at home, older people, retired people, pensioners and people who look after children or have caring responsibilities, are being affected more than others. This may get more serious as we move into the cold winter months. People who live in the countryside tend to suffer more from higher prices and increased fuel prices, where getting around by car is vital. If you live in a rural area, have a think about sharing a ride with a neighbour. This connection on your commute will be valuable company as well. Many people are already aware of food banks. Still, there are similar kinds of support in our communities that run school uniform banks and toy libraries, where second-hand items are available for people who need them. Your local library is also an excellent place to look for community resources; many also offer activities for families (and, of course, lend books for that sleep remedy!). If you are having problems with housing or homelessness,Shelter are there to help. They have a helpline, online advice and a webchat. In Northern Ireland, you can contact theSimon Community. Energy costs, continue to be a problem for lots of us.Money Saving Expert's websitehas lots of practical information and advice. Many of us havedebtsthat are a result of the recent pandemic, and they’re continuing to grow as interest rises take effect. There’s also the constant worry that we might lose our jobs as the recession bites. Many of us have been relying on credit cards, loans and overdrafts for our day-to-day expenses, and the way things are right now, this problemisn’tgoing away. But, it’s reassuring to know that most banks, credit card companies and respectable lenders are very approachable. They would rather know about your financial problems and help make repayment arrangements rather than allow your debts to grow out of hand. Most local councils will also have arrangements to help with council tax payments. In Northern Ireland, you can check if you are eligible for support with your rates. There’s absolutely no shame in finding and getting help. There are millions of people in the same boat. So, don't delay and get in touch with them as soon as possible. If you need help managing your debt, theStepChange debt charitycan give helpful advice. No matter how large or small your debt problem is, they can help. They will give you expert advice and recommend debt solutions to suit your situation. When it’s a choice between eating or heating, our health could suffer too. Many of us sometimes usedrugsto block out “difficult” feelings such as sadness, fear, or shame. No one wants to feel bad; for some people, drugs andalcoholoffer temporary relief. Unfortunately, they don’t stop the feelings from returning and could make things worse or even create other problems, including damage to mental and physical health, relationships, work, or study. If you think you may be using drugs or alcohol to cope with difficult feelings, it could help to be aware of it but not beat yourself up about it. Being understanding and kind to yourself is just as important as anything else and is also good for your mental health. Your next possible step would be to talk with someone you trust or one of the charities that offer confidential, free information and advice, including how to reduce the harmfulness of using drugs. Have a look atTalk To Frank, for example. You could also look for other ways of coping with painful feelings, such as getting help with the situation causing them, if possible, and finding a trusted person to talk with. This could be a friend or relative, a colleague, a person working for a charity helpline, your GP, or a counsellor. Many charities around the country offer free or low-cost therapy. Here’s more detailed information aboutgetting help with your mental healthfrom many potential sources. Some people find it helpful to go to “anonymous” meetings, such asNarcotics Anonymous, to share with others who have or had similar experiences. Some of these meetings are also now online. This is easy to say but not always easy to do. Getting motivated and inspired to cook and eat healthily on a budget can be hard, especially when you're feeling mentally low. The Association of UK Dieticians have somegreat ideas to help with cooking at home on a budget. Most supermarkets also have ideas and inspiration for cooking on a budget, as does theBBC 'Budget recipes and advice'. At least have a look. You don’t know until you’ve tried! If you are having problems buying those food essentials, thenthe Trussell Trustare here to help. They can help you find your local foodbank or provide advice via their helpline. This is a tough one. With all the worries that we might have, oursleeptends to be affected. Stress, anxiety, and general worry all make this a challenge. Lack of a good sleep will also make everything feel much worse. But there are things you can do to help get a good night’s sleep. These tips actually do work, so don’t give up and try them out: We also have some great information aboutgetting a good night’s sleep. Older people seem to be affected more than others, butAge UKhas some very useful advice that could help. You don’t have to be old to benefit, so everyone should have a look. While millions of us are finding things really hard, others are just about managing to keep their heads above water. If this applies to you, then you have some great skills and experience that you could share with others. If you’re confident managing your finances, you’ve probably learned some lessons along the way. Passing these lessons on to others is a great way to help. Volunteering is also a really practical way to help others. Think about contacting your local food bank to see if they need help. You could also see if you’re able to donate food to them. TheTrussell Trustoperates the largest network of food banks, and your local council will also have a list of those in your area. You could pass on your unused clothes to a local charity. Many of them will come and collect your donations, so it’s pretty easy. Theseacts of kindnesscan make everyone feel better, including you! Getting out and about for some social activity is one of the first things to suffer when we’re stressed and anxious. We can also feel bad about ourselves when we don’t have any money to go out. The stigma around this can also stop us from looking for help. Our theme for this year’s Mental Health Awareness Week was loneliness, so have a look. Our content is filled with stories of people coping with being lonely and making connections. As we’ve said before, there is absolutely no shame in finding and getting help. There are millions of people in exactly the same boat. Most of us are feeling the effects of the cost-of-living crisis, whether in work or not. Many employers know about this, and some are offering extra support, so don’t be afraid to ask. Contact your HR department, which will treat your questions with complete confidentiality. You could also ask your union representative for advice. We all know that the news is mostly bad, and social media can make the feelings of doom and gloom even worse. Too much of your favourite social media channel can also affect your mental health. After hearing all about political events and government actions, we can start to feel fear, anxiety, or a loss of control over our lives and plans. We’ll start to worry about our safety and our loved ones. If we have lived through similar times in the past, it could start to bring back painful memories. Have a look at our page onbad news and mental health. Social media is a great way to stay in touch with people, but inevitably, people share stories or their feelings about what’s going on in the world, which can leave us feeling anxious. Try to keep aware of your mood and feelings when you’re watching TV, listening to the radio or online, and if you start to feel down, reach for the off switch. Most importantly, don’t forget about yourself. Have a bit of time to dwell on the things about the day that made you feel good. If it works for you, try somemindfulness exercises. Find a quiet place, sit, or lie down and close your eyes. Think about the ‘now’ and your feelings, your body sensations, and your surroundings.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/why-co-production-important-later-life,Why is co-production important in later life?,"What is co-production? There are many definitions. For the Social Care Institute of Excellence (SCIE), co-production is about developing more equal partnerships between people who use services, carers and professionals. The ""nothing about us, without us"" message is fundamental in the disability movement and at the heart of all co-production work. At the Mental Health Foundation, to partner and co-produce with communities is one of the six principles of all our programmes. Co-production is about building relationships, involving all stakeholders from the conception to the completion of projects. Doing thingswithpeople (rather thantothem) requires cultural, structural and practical commitment within organisations and progress needs to be reviewed regularly. SCIE has developed principles of equality, diversity, access and reciprocity to be used as shared values for putting co-production into action. For National Co-Production Week 2017, we are making the commitment to continue co-producing all the work we undertake across the life course. Co-production means that projects can deliver what people want and that they are more likely to stay engaged in them - hence they are more likely to feel the benefits. This also leads to economic benefits, as people need to be able to access solutions outside mental health services. Using co-production to underpin our preventative public health plans in later life means that we will continue to facilitate programmes that are both evidence-based and that people will want to access to improve their quality of life and mental health. I manage theStanding Togetherproject. With funding from the Big Lottery, we are facilitating 20 self-help groups in extra care and retirement housing schemes, to address loneliness and wellbeing. The idea for the Standing Together project came from tenants wanting to join a previous project, which worked only with people with dementia. People who participate in Standing Together groups may have a learning disability, experience poor mental health, memory issues and/or be socially isolated. We also have tenants as members of the project’s Advisory Group, one of whom lives with dementia and has made an impression on other stakeholders. He was frustrated as the group he attended was not being sustained after the six months of the Mental Health Foundation's staff facilitation and advocated for its continuation. Consequently, someone has been employed to continue the facilitation of that group. We are currently developing a Welsh version of Standing Together. Tenants attended the very first planning meeting with partner organisations and will be involved throughout the application, delivery and evaluation of the project. A database has been set up of people who are interested in co-producing our later life work. We will be asking people on the list what their priorities are for the future. This information will inform a new advisory group to co-produce and steer the direction of our work. There are no results that match your filtered options. Pleaseresetyour filters and try again.

Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. Slowly but surely,mental health stigmaisdecreasing. However, this article will show we’ve still some way to go. We asked people with lived experience of mental health problems what they wish people knew about mental ill-health. Mental health problems affect people in different ways. No two people behave or feel exactly the same way when they are unwell. Likewise, there is no ‘one size fits all’ treatment for mental ill-health – medication may work for some, and not for others. The same applies to mindfulness, exercise or talking therapies. Dealing with mental health problems is a work in progress. There are ups and downs and these can happen at any time. Just because someone seems well does not mean that they are well. “People also seem to think that mental ill-health is some sort of choice. You can't choose not to have mental ill-health any more than you can choose not to have cancer...” Nobody chooses to have a mental health problem, just like people don’t choose to have physical health problems. Mental health problems such asanxietyanddepressioncan be severe and long-lasting and have a big impact on someone’s life. Mental ill-health is complex and can be difficult to deal with, it is not something you just “snap out of”. It takes time to recover from or learn how to manage a mental health problem. Mental health problems affect the way people think, feel and behave. They can also experience unpleasant physical symptoms. Managing all of these experiences is a sign of strength and not weakness. “The fatigue that comes with it. Nobody seems to understand that it not only affects you emotionally, but physically too” Living with a mental health problem can affect your physical health too. The physical effects of mental health problems can include tiredness, loss of appetite and aches and pains in the body. In the same way, engaging in exercise can have a positive effect on mental health. Mental health problems vary in nature. They range from the worries we all experience as part of daily life to serious long-term conditions. Living with mental ill-health can affect all areas of a person’s life, from carrying out daily tasks to forming healthy relationships. “Although they can't see the illness, it's still there.” You may not be able to tell by looking at a person that they have a mental health problem. This doesn’t mean that it doesn’t exist or is “all in their head”. The effects of mental ill-health are very real. “That self-harm isn't for attention.” Someone may use self-harm as a way of coping with negative thoughts or feelings. Many people who self-harm don’t talk to anyone about what they are going through. Breaking down myths such as these can encourage people who self-harm to talk about their experiences and seek support early. ‘The truth about self-harm’covers more information on self-harm and other myths. Just as we can all experience physical ill-health, we can also experience mental health problems. 1 in 4 people experience a mental health problem in any given year. The majority of people who experience mental health problems can recover or learn to live with them, especially if they get help early on. Stigmatising language such as this can prevent people from getting the help they need at the right time. “That if I’m grumpy or uncomfortable around you, don’t take it personally, it’s not about you. I have anxiety, I’m like this around everyone” Mental health problems can cause people to withdraw, become more irritable or behave differently than usual. It is important to focus on how the person is feeling rather than how they act towards you. Try not to take it personally as it can be a symptom of a mental health problem. Living with mental health problems can be challenging in itself. It may be difficult to understand why someone may be feeling or behaving a certain way. Regardless, it is important to offer support in a non-judgemental, respectful and caring way. Just because someone isn’t being vocal doesn’t mean they don’t want to talk. If you see someone going through a hard time, talking to them is often a good step to take. This way you can find out what is troubling them and what you can do to help. If you are feeling like ending your life or feel unable to keep yourself safe, please call 999 or go to A&E and ask for the contact of the nearest crisis resolution team.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/my-stress-footprint,My stress footprint,"This content mentions anxiety, which some people may find triggering. Last month, I wrote ablogannouncingstressas the theme ofMental Health Awareness Weekand some of the comments I received on it gave me food for thought. Many agreed this is a theme that is overdue serious consideration. But one comment stood out: 'Why don’t you consider the stress you cause, not just the stress you experience?' Next month, we will be releasing the results of the largest and most comprehensive survey on stress in the UK. It will undoubtedly find that a significant amount of stress we experience comes from the interaction we have with other people in our lives. The Stress Footprintis the second-handstressothers unknowingly pick up from you and you unknowingly pick up from others. We are social and empathetic creatures and often feel and mimic the emotions of those we're around, such as tension caused by feelings of stress. So, I decided to do a very unscientific survey. I wanted to know from colleagues, friends and family about: I sent half a dozen people (including my wife and son) the same set of questions. It felt like a scary thing to ask. How would I feel if people unloaded a stream of hitherto unexpressed grievances that served to undermine the potential of the relationship? Could I handle feedback about how I contributed to people’s feeling of being overwhelmed and stressed? Well, the results came in. One-by-one, people gave me humbling and gracious feedback. I want to share what I learnt and invite you consider doing the same! Even though I felt vulnerable in asking for feedback (and I think others felt vulnerable giving it), people responded with kindness and honesty, not cruelty. In every case, the feedback left me with a deeper sense of respect and trust for that person. Vulnerability is often the gateway to greater levels of trust and, by definition, there is no comfortable way of being vulnerable. However, it is that trust that can help to reduce stress levels in relationships because there is a stronger platform to raise concerns more openly. Read our relationships guide to learn the signs of healthy and toxic relationships The fascinating aspect that emerged from the people’s answers was that it revealed patterns in how I react to events and the world. For example, my wife cited the same dynamic every time a particular person visited our home. It often led to tension and arguments and yet I hadn’t spotted the 'Groundhog Day' nature of my reactions. Human behaviour is often like that. We think we are responding fresh to each new situation when, in reality, we are rehashing learnt behaviour. Sometimes, those patterns have emerged because they have worked in the past or we have been rewarded in some way. However, in repeating them or applying them in a new context, we fail to see the stress storm we leave in our wake. Or at least I did. It was humbling to read that it was often my reactions to small events or attempts to push through ideas or control outcomes that caused the most stress. It was often when I feltanxiousabout something that I would be most likely to pass that feeling on to others. Whether it was ambushing a colleague with an idea, or using my ‘moany voice’ with my son to get him to hurry up with tying his shoe laces, it was me passing on my worries to others. Being able to spot and manage my own anxiety, and not be controlled by it, feels like the holy grail towards reducing my stress footprint. The great news was that despite the examples of stress I’d caused, no one used those examples as an opportunity to write me off. It’s obvious that avoiding all stress in long-term relationships is neither possible nor preferable. For relationships to flourish, we need to learn how to move beyond the times when we bump up against each other and cause each other pain. In one of the most relieving pieces of feedback, my son said what he found helped most was when I’d tuck him into bed and take time to say sorry for getting frustrated. That reconciliation process (or the ability to let go and forgive) is what therapists call the rupture and repair process. I’d argue it is a vital part of preventing stress from building up to chronic levels. Trace your stress footprint today. Walk a little lighter tomorrow.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/body-image-key-better-mental-health,Body image – a key to better mental health,"This content mentions body image or generally discusses weight, which some people may find triggering. Mental Health Foundation CEO, Mark Rowland, unpacks the big theme for Mental Health Awareness Week (13 to 19 May 2019) and how the way we view our bodies impacts our mental health. This year’sMental Health Awareness Weektheme,body image, has direct relevance to everyone reading this blog. All of us live with our bodies as they evolve and change. Just as all of us have a role in shaping an inclusive culture where we help others feel comfortable in their own skin. We are all intimately aware of the particular idiosyncrasies of our own body; its strengths and wonders and its limitations. No piece of technology that you will ever buy will match the complexity, sophistication and regenerative powers of your body. And yet… For too many of us, our bodies are sources of shame and distress. From an early age, we are bombarded with images that define what an ‘ideal body’ looks like. Sometimes, we have facedstigmaor cruelty as friends and family have used how we look as a way to put us down for a cheap laugh. I know I have been guilty of that within my own family In therapeutic terms, we have internalised a sense of SHOULD when it comes to our bodies. It is as if we each have our own internal GIF on a loop reinforcing what the ideal looks like. My GIF repeats Daniel Craig, strutting toned and chiselled from the sea. It’s no wonder that when I catch a glimpse of my actual reflection, I sigh with a sense of disappointment. And although we know girls and young women are particularly vulnerable to poor body image, this year we will explore body image as an issue that cuts across gender, age, sexuality and ethnicity.Bodyguard star Richard Maddenis among the surprising voices to have spoken out recently against the demands they face to look a certain way. All this might not be so serious if it didn’t have profound implications for our mental andphysical health. The opposite also seems true: the more comfortable you are with your body, the greater your overall well-being, and the less likely you are to engage in destructive behaviours. DuringMental Health Awareness Week, we will release findings that will bring together the latest research on body image with one of the largest surveys ever completed to give a picture of how people of all ages and across the UK feel about their bodies. It will also set out the increased risk of mental health problems that accompany poor body image. We want to ignite a national conversation about how we can be kinder to our bodies as a guard against the individual, family and cultural influences that can lead to a gnawing and sometimes debilitating sense of dissatisfaction with our bodies. Since ancient times, there has been a long line of Western philosophers who influenced how we think about the separation of the body and mind. But the evidence definitively shows that this sort of dualism is not a helpful construct and that a holistic view about the inter-relatedness of our bodies and minds is vital to achieve a healthier population. It is perhaps why it still surprises us that cultures that are focused on materialism, consumption and celebrity fare worse in terms of people’s body image and mental health. So, duringMental Health Awareness Week, we will make the case that the distress related to poor body image and the related mental health problems can be prevented. We will explore the changes needed in our cultural values, parenting styles, schooling approaches, use of technology, advertising standards and reducing discrimination that will make a real difference. We know we can make a difference because with your help, we already have. Last year, it was a concern over body image that led us to seek a ban on a series ofcosmetic surgery ads shown around the TV show Love Island. We warned the Advertising Standards Authority that the ads ‘painted a false picture of perfection’ and ‘exacerbated young people’s insecurities’ – and I’m glad to say the ASA seemed to agree and ruled it should be banned. So, we don’t simply want to publish a report. We’ve alreadyoffered some ideasabout how people can help protect themselves against harm from social media. During Mental Health Awareness Week, we’ll publish further suggestions about body image in particular, and how we can look after ourselves and each other. We will also make recommendations to policymakers about the changes they can make towards better mental health. But we are nowhere near having all the answers. We would love to hear about your experiences and opinions around body image, and what you believe should change to help us to be kinder to our bodies and healthier in our minds.

The data simply didn’t exist, especially in relation to undiagnosed or untreated conditions. To address this gap, the Department of Health commissioned social researchers, psychiatrists and epidemiologists to design the first survey to rigorously assess mental illness in a random sample of the general population. It was catchily named the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (APMS), though nowadays also goes by the more user-friendly moniker 'Mental Health and Wellbeing Survey’. Soon after, surveys of the mental health of other populations were also set up: offenders, the homeless and people living in institutions. Those surveys have never been repeated, despite changes in these populations and an urgent need to understand their current mental health and circumstances. The general population surveys of adults, however, have been conducted every seven years. The recent completion of the fourth survey makes this the longest-running series in the world to monitor a nation’s mental health using consistent methods. In 2014/15, interviewers went into the homes of a random sample of 7500 people aged from 16 to over 100, including some with no contact with health services and many with conditions that hadn’t previously been identified. Datasets from the series are made freely and publicly available to non-commercial organisations through theUK Data Service’s archive. Researchers, epidemiologists, policymakers, clinicians and others have collaborated on more than 300 reports and papers. Alongside assessing mental disorders, the APMS questionnaire collects data on the wider circumstances of people’s lives. Many of the publications provide evidence of inequalities in mental illness by a range of demographic, social and economic factors, including: The2007 APMSwas one of the first government-funded surveys to ask aboutsexual identityand the first to combine data on this with assessments of mental illness.Analyses of the datashowed that being lesbian, gay or bisexual (defined by both identity and sexual partnership) was associated withdepression;generalised anxiety disorder;obsessive compulsive disorder; phobic disorder; probablepsychosis;suicidal thoughts and acts;self-harm; andalcoholanddrugdependence. Being discriminated against on the grounds of sexual identity was also found to be linked to mental illness, suggesting that discrimination acts as a social stressor contributing to mental health problems in this population. Thereport for the latest surveypublished last week sets out the study’s methods and describes trends and prevalence of disorders, treatment rates and some associations. It highlighted, for example, thatBlack peoplewith a common mental disorder are far less likely than White British people to get treatment. However, it’s when the full dataset launches with the UK Data Service in the next few months that the real work for analysts up and down the country begins.

This blog was written by Jolie Goodman, Programmes Manager for Later Life & Empowerment. The Mental Health Foundation works across the life course. Concerns about body image and appearance, while often associated with younger people, are not exclusive to being young. Though our appearance and our relationship with our bodies change as we age, we do not stop valuing our bodies, and inlater life, adults are still concerned about body image. The theme ofMental Health Awareness Week13 to 19 May 2019 isbody image - how we think and feel about our bodies. Facilitating a life class seemed an interesting and direct way to explore issues of body image with people in later life and those who work with them. I still attempt to be an artist some of the time, the chance to look directly at a naked body, in the flesh and reflect on that experience creatively was very exciting. The launch of theStanding Together Cymru projectwas an excellent opportunity to do this. Initially, people were a little reluctant to sign up for the class, but it ended up being oversubscribed. It’s always strange to be faced with a naked body to draw, though quickly it becomes quite normal. People made several quick drawings from standing poses and then a longer drawing from a seated pose. People drew in charcoal because it’s versatile and you can make bolder images. There was general surprise about what people drew from with their eyes shut! I’m 80, I haven’t drawn since I was 15. Never life drawing. It’s been a very interesting class. The general feeling was that it does. In a culture where the imagery that surrounds us is mainly ageist portraying young, slim, airbrushed images, it can be hard to be visible in later life. As you get older, everything goes south. It’s very difficult to lose weight. It’s all up and no legs. Old people are portrayed as negative but the body is beautiful. We don’t need to conform to the stereotypical view of a ‘nana’. It’s still possible to be in good shape and attractive in later life. ""The session did make me examine my own preconceptions about body image & ageing. I was expecting to draw someone with lots of wrinkles. I can’t believe that our model is 77. He didn’t look it!"" - Member of staff So, what do you expect a 77-year-old man to look like? We all have stereotypes, but our model, Bruce, is someone who has always played sports and now goes to the gym regularly. One participant said, ""For your age, you’re a fine figure of a man."" Bruce’s body enables him to earn an income as a model. He is a great role model for being confident about body image in later life. Some of the drawings were left on display in the communal area of the later life housing scheme, where theStanding Together CymruLaunch took place. The next day, a relative complained, feeling that the images were inappropriate, and the drawings were taken down. To be faced with life drawings is not going to be everyone’s cup of tea. The life class itself led to stimulating conversations and the chance to talk about body image in later life in a positive and non-discriminating way. As a woman in my early fifties, who comes under our categorization as a person in later life, I recently went to a fancy dress party as the artist Salvador Dali. I don’t think I have ever felt more visible while travelling on public transport from north to south London. If you want to be more visible, wearing a moustache is very liberating! If you feel affected by the content you have read, please see ourget helppage for support. Our research found that 30% of all adults have felt so stressed by body image and appearance that they felt overwhelmed or unable to cope. That’s almost 1 in every 3 people. Standing Together Cymru was a three-year project that included 30 weekly peer support groups in retirement and extra care housing schemes. We ran the groups for six months. The groups aimed to deepen social connections and improve wellbeing. As we get older, changes in our lives such as retirement, bereavement or physical illness can affect our mental health.

Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. Northern Ireland hascatastrophic levels of mental ill health. More people have died bysuicidein the past 18 years than were killed during 30 years of conflict. We have failed for two decades to address the mental health legacy of the conflict and now our society is blighted by trauma across generations. Today, Northern Ireland’s Secretary of State Karen Bradley will address the House of Commons and outline the steps she is going to take following the collapse of last weeks talks. I am hosting a delegation by leading mental health experts at Westminster to call for action to address the mental health crisis in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland has had no functioning government for 13 months; April marks the 20th anniversary of the Belfast Agreement; and 2018 is the 10th anniversary of the publication of the last major mental health policy in Northern Ireland: the Bamford Review. The failure to deliver for mental health over the last 13 months, and indeed over the last 20 years since the peace settlement, is unacceptable. The Mental Health Foundation is standing alongside Northern Ireland mental health charities and professional bodies to call for immediate Government action. The collapse of the Northern Ireland Assembly has worsened Northern Ireland’s mental health crisis. The momentum following the May 2016 election of cross-party consensus to appoint a Mental Health Champion has been lost. Promised action on a regional trauma service, increased access to psychological therapies, recovery-focused provision,maternal mental healthandeating disordershas all failed to materialise. Without a functioning Executive, none of the recommendations of the Historical Institutional Abuse (HIA) Inquiry can be implemented, including mental health support for people who were abused in children's homes and other residential institutions (1922-1995) and their families. During the last 13 months, we have lost so many opportunities to support people experiencing mental health problems and prevent their occurrence. Therefore, commitments secured need to be robustly monitored by politicians at Westminster. Whatever form of Government we have in Northern Ireland, mental health must be its top priority including within the budget that the Secretary of State now needs to set. We cannot achieve a peaceful society in Northern Ireland without peaceful minds. If we invest in mental health support and work together to prevent mental health problems, then mental health will be an asset for our society.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/how-drinking-affects-our-mental-health,How drinking affects our mental health,"This content discusses substance abuse and addiction (which may include mentions of alcohol or drug use), abuse or violence, trauma, depression and anxiety, which some people may find triggering. As festive drinks party invitations start arriving, people won’t need reminding that our culture is as soaked inalcoholas a Christmas pudding. For many people, moderate drinking is an enjoyable part of their lives and helps them relax, enjoy themselves and savour a fine wine, craft beer or subtle spirit. I've made myself thirsty just by writing that line, but I won’t be reaching for the bottle because I am one of a large minority of people who cannot drink in the moderate, pleasurable way described above. With the help of supportive family, friends and services, includingcognitive behavioural therapy, I managed to break the cycle and stopped drinking altogether nine years ago. Subsequently, life has never been so good for me but it’s estimated thatthere are 600,000 dependent drinkers in England alone, many of them and their families suffering as my family and I did. Problem drinking is closely associated withviolence,traumaandpovertywhich are some of the most significant factors in harming mental health. Not only can alcohol act as an indirect pre-determinant of mental ill-health - by causing violence that traumatises, for example - but the substance itself changes a person's brain chemistry and can directly causedepressionandanxiety. My advice to individuals concerned about their own drinking is to seek help and support. Trying to go 'cold turkey' without medical advice can be dangerous, so talk to your doctor. Despite huge cuts to public health budgets that provide addiction services, there are still many good services availablevia your GPas well as organisations likeAlcoholics Anonymouswhich has groups nearly everywhere.Recoveryis entirely possible and life can get much better, believe me I’ve been there and have never regretted quitting. But alcohol is not just a problem for individuals - it is an issue for society both in creating the conditions that make problem drinking more likely, and in suffering the consequences of it. Alcohol-related crime and illness put huge pressure on our public services from the police and accident and emergency departments to children’s social care and mental health clinics. We need to reinvest in the public health services that treat addiction and which have been cut by 12% in recent years. It is great that Health Secretary Matt Hancock is talking about 'prevention' but this needs to be backed up by investment and legislation to support recovery and protect vulnerable people from harm. Experts sometimes talk about how we live in an 'obesogenic environment', which is a fancy term for being surrounded by junk food adverts andunhealthy food optionsbut we also live in an 'alcoholic environment'. There’s little restriction, in England at least, on advertising or selling booze 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In my Borough, there are more than 50 off-licences open 24 hours a day. I cannot think of what possible good can come from people being able to buy gallons of vodka at 5am on nearly every high street. The old Sunday trading laws used to be the only thing that would stop my all-weekend bingeing. Scotland has tougher licensing laws and, earlier this year, brought in minimum alcohol unit pricing which means super-strong lagers, ciders and spirits bought in off-licences are much more expensive. These are positive steps, but I believe our leaders need to go much further with minimum unit pricing throughout the UK, in addition to a ban on alcohol adverts and stricter licencing and labelling laws. Earlier this year, we at the Mental Health Foundation contributed to work with our colleagues at theCentre for Mental HealthandInstitute for Alcohol Studiesthat created thisdiscussion paper. We will also be publishing a guide to help you support your friends who you think may have a problem. Now, action needs to be taken to stop more problem drinkers from being created and to support those who need support to live a better life.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/reducing-stress-later-life-and-end-life,Reducing stress in later life and end of life,"This content mentions death and bereavement, which some people may find triggering. Death. It's a pretty dark topic isn't it? Not many of us want to talk about our own or loved ones' deaths before they happen. Last month, my Grandma passed away at the age of 87 after an increasingly difficult struggle withdementia. Throughout her life, she was incredibly active in her local community in north Manchester. She was a teacher at her local primary school, ran choirs and flower clubs, played the piano at a local nursery school and had a leading role in the Mothers' Union. Sadly, dementia made it harder for her to do these things in her last few years. She became unable to drive, and then had problems with mobility and looking after herself, so she moved into a care home. A notorious chatterbox, dementia significantly reduced her processing speed, so she found maintaining conversation more and more difficult in her final months, no matter how hard she tried. Imagine having your independence and so many of the things that matter most to you taken away by such a challenging illness over which you have no control. It sounds like quite a stressful experience. But we can ease thestresson the850,000 people in the UK who have dementia(a figure that will rise to 1 million by 2025 and 2 million by 2051). Initially, my Grandma had carers coming into her home a few times a day, to help her wash, go to the bathroom and cook her meals. She had also experienced several falls, resulting in a number of trips to A&E for treatment to head wounds. Despite having an alarm around her neck, she often forgot to wear it, meaning there were occasions when she had to wait for carers to arrive before being taken to the hospital. My Grandma hated the idea of leaving her home to go into a care home with new surroundings and other people doing tasks for her that, not long before, were second nature to her. But the reality was that she needed round-the-clock care provided by professionals in a care home. She got that care, and more. Now, I know care homes are a controversial topic and I'm not going to defend or argue the case for care homes in general. Every case is unique and should be treated as such. What I will say, however, is that care homes can be a huge help for a lot of people and should never be automatically discounted. Lyndhurst Care in Middleton, north Manchester, provided a home for my Grandma for her last two years. Despite not initially being keen, she settled in rather quickly. She was allowed to hang pictures on the walls and bring ornaments and pieces of furniture, so in some ways, her room was reminiscent of her house in which she’d lived for nearly 60 years. She had family and friends visit her on most days – all of whom were made to feel welcome enough to want to go again. We know how maintaining positive relationships and connections is vital for good mental health (something we focused on as part of ourStanding Togetherproject), and this was important in helping my Grandma stay as mentally healthy as possible. She looked forward to and took great joy from visits from her children, grandchildren and, in her last 18 months, her great-grandson. One thing to remember if you do have a relative with dementia is that visiting them is really important. We are lucky that my Grandma never reached the stage where she didn’t recognise her family but she did often forget our previous visits and details of them. However, 'emotional memory' means that people with dementia can feel the powerful and positive impacts of connection with friends and family even if they don’t remember the event itself. And then there was the team at Lyndhurst, who were magnificent. They not only provided great-quality care – they provided social interaction, humour and love on a day-to-day basis that was priceless. The care home treated my Grandma like a much-loved member of a family. This was evident throughout her stay, but especially at her funeral, where four carers gave up their day off to join two 'on duty' colleagues at the funeral and were as emotional as anybody in the congregation. All of these touches, which may seem small individually, combined to help reduce the impact of what could have been a seriously stressful situation for my Grandma and helped her to smile and laugh despite her condition. So, back to death. It's not something we talk about much. But maybe we should. Different people have different wishes for the end of their life and, where possible, we should strive to carry them out. It was obvious when my Grandma went into the care home that she would spend her last days there. How long that would be, we weren't sure, but it wasn't likely to be longer than a couple of years. After Christmas, it was clear that her health was deteriorating and that she didn't have too long left. The care home and medical professionals helped my family decide that palliative care was the best option. Later lifeexpert and ourStanding Together projectlead Jolie Goodman gives her top tips: Palliative care has been in the news recently with the high-profile and tragic Alfie Evans case. The Alfie case was very different to that of my Grandma but it raised some important questions about end-of-life care. End-of-life care should never become a 'never event'. Instead, it is seeing the reality that someone is extremely unwell and will pass away at some point in the near future. With my Grandma, the palliative care option allowed her to stay comfortable, peaceful and, therefore, relatively stress and worry-free in her final days and hours. So, despite the sadness and loss that I feel since my Grandma died, I also feel comforted and thankful that the inevitable event of her passing was peaceful and dignified, just as she would have wanted. As we get older, changes in our lives such as retirement, bereavement or physical illness can affect our mental health. This guide provides you with tips on how to look after your mental health in later life. Dementia isn’t just about memory loss. It can affect how you think, feel, speak and behave.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/matt-hancock-mental-health-priorities-new-health-secretary,Matt Hancock: mental health priorities for the new health secretary,"Matt Hancock has succeeded Jeremy Hunt as Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, appointed just a few days after the NHS celebrated its 70th birthday with a 3.4% increased funding settlement. His appointment followedtwo significant resignationsfrom the cabinet over the government's Brexit proposals, and while Brexit and Donald Trump's visit to the UK continue to dominate the headlines, this is a crucial time for mental health. Work is starting on a 10-year plan for the NHS; Professor Sir Simon Wessely is partway through his review of the Mental Health Act and there is an urgent need for a sustained, genuinely long-term commitment to improving the mental health of the population. Lengthy A&E waiting times and delays to operations have historically dominated the headlines about the NHS, but in recent times, mental health has begun to feature in our national debates about health and receive more of the attention it deserves. The increased prominence of mental health is long overdue and must continue, not only in the form of traditional health services but with investment in emerging digital technologies for mental health and in cross-sectoralpreventiveaction. Jeremy Hunt was a strong advocate for mental health, and it's important that Matt Hancock continues his work. He needs to ensure that mental health benefits fairly from the extra £20 billion a year the NHS will have by 2023, and as Jeremy Hunt leaves office, it’s not yet clear that it will. We know from his previous posts at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) that Hancock is a champion of digital innovation. We hope his enthusiasm will now embrace the role that digital technologies can play in preventing and treating mental health problems, and their potential to benefit more people than can be reached by current service models alone. It's important, too, that he ensures full delivery of the current Five Year Forward View for Mental Health, including championing its cross-government recommendations and finally appointing the long-awaited Equalities Champion needed to help drive change. These should be key priorities, as many of the roots of good and poor mental health lie in policy areas such ashousing, community services, employment, welfare and education. Some people and communities are at significantly higher risk of mental health problems, yet they also face bigger barriers to support. Other government departments, therefore, need to be made aware of how they can protect and support people's mental health rather than place it at (greater) risk. The Secretary of State can make these arguments with ministerial colleagues: we need wider engagement with the factors affecting mental health and, fundamentally, a morepreventiveapproach to tackling the high levels of unmet mental health needs that persist in our society. The forthcoming social care green paper will focus on care and support for older people, but good social care is also vital for supporting people with long-term mental health problems. It is also vital for preventingchildhood adversity– a major risk factor for developing mental health problems later in life. But persistent reductions in local authority budgets have reduced resources for social care,prevention and early intervention– for example, there have been significant reductions in the numbers of health visitors, who provide valuable support to parents and families. The 2019 Comprehensive Spending Review is an opportunity to begin to turn this around, and the Department of Health and Social Care has just as much interest in doing so as the Department for Communities and Local Government. Connection between people and across government is as necessary to good mental health as digital connectivity is to effective digital technology. We hope this is something the new Secretary of State for Health will recognise and champion. In July 2022, we responded to a government consultation on their vision for a new, ten-year mental health and well-being plan. The Scottish Government is preparing to write a new Mental Health and Wellbeing Strategy for Scotland. It has asked the public to share their ideas on what actions should be included in a new Mental Health and Wellbeing Strategy for Scotland. 7th May 2025

Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. In this blog, Jolie Goodman takes us through why TV is important to some people inlater lifeand how it can help with feelings ofisolation and loneliness. Wherever you stand in the row about who should pay for people over the age of 75 to watch TV, one thing is painfully clear, television is a lifeline for this group of people. Television is a companion, a link to the outside world, a source of comfort and entertainment and a connection to other people, through shared conversations about what is on TV. The UK has an ageing population.[1] By 2030, one in five people in the UK (21.8%) will be aged 65+, 6.8% will be aged 75+ and 3.2% will be aged 85+.[2] As many as 49% of older people (equivalent to over 5 million individuals) say their television or pets are their main form of company.[3] The ‘box’s’ importance really can’t be exaggerated, for these people who, as they age, are increasingly likely to sufferloneliness,bereavement, illness and disability. TV doesn’t cure these struggles, but it can make them easier to live with. The testimony of the older people we work with makes this abundantly clear. We also asked people in these groups in what ways TV is important for them. Many felt that it was a good way to use their brains and to keep learning: “I love watching the news - only the BBC, I like to know what is happening in the world and I feel connected. I can’t hold a newspaper or an iPad with my hands to read the news, so I depend on the television."" “I learn something new every time I watch the telly, it’s nice."" “It keeps my mind sharp"" Watching television is seen as a way to feel less alone and reduce social isolation: “It’s company, I put it on first thing in the morning, I feel most alone then."" “It’s the first person and the last person of the day to talk to me."" “When my husband was away, I would put the television on most of the time, sometimes leave it on all night, I felt safer with it on with the noise and light bouncing off it. It looked like I wasn’t alone."" People who take part inpeer groupsthe Mental Health Foundation run in later life housing in South-East Wales, as part of ourStanding Together Cymru, feel that the changes to the free TV licence are unfair. “It is very hypocritical of the government remembering and celebrating the 75th anniversary of D-Day last week and then taking away from us this week.” There was uncertainty about what the means testing meant “How poor do I have to be?”, “Would my bungalow I live be part of the means test?”, “Is a black and white licence cheaper, can I still get one of those?."" There were lots of agreements with this comment about how television made them feel safer and how watching television has a positive impact on mental health. “My television was broken a while ago and I was anxious to get it fixed, my daughter said how sad I am depending on the television and fussing about not having it for a few days. I told her wait till you are my age, then you’ll understand. I know that we are meant to be independent living, but I am prisoner here. I can’t get out, I physically can’t and I can’t afford to get a taxi up the hill all the time. If I didn’t have the television, I would besuicidal”. In other later life groups, we have looked at how much viewing habits have altered for people in later life in their lifetimes. From just going to the cinema, to renting TVs, to watching the Coronation, right up to watching on a laptop or phone, we have used this in groups to talk about change. The technological change that people have witnessed can be a way to reflect on the changes and losses they have experienced throughout their lives. There is a lot of discussion about how to much TV and screen time is bad for young people’s well-being. The people in later life from theStanding Together Cymrugroups clearly make the case that they see watching television as having a positive impact on their mental health. As well as challenging the stereotype that Love Island is only for millennials, by telling us how much they enjoy the banter! “Television is something we can all have in common to talk about and it takes us away from the everyday problems."" Whatever your view about who pays for the TV licence, it’s worth remembering that research shows that every £1 invested in tackling loneliness can save £3 in health costs.[1] If you are feeling like ending your life or feel unable to keep yourself safe, please call 999 or go to A&E and ask for the contact of the nearest crisis resolution team.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/love-island-power-tv-producers-promote-good-mental-health,Love Island: the power of the TV producers to promote good mental health,"This content mentions suicide or suicidal thoughts and body image or generally discusses weight. Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. Over the past few weeks, I have enjoyed England's World Cup run, sizzled in the London sunshine and revelled at music festivals. If you know me, none of that is surprising. But what I didn't expect was that at the same time, I'd be hooked by Love Island. I hadn't watched any of the ITV2 reality show since the original celebrity series in 2005, with its star-strewn cast of such 21st-century luminaries as Lee Sharpe, Abi Titmus, Calum Best and Liz McLarnon. I don't watch much telly, never mind something I'd previously considered trashy and pointless. But this year, I decided to give Love Island a try. Maybe it was to do with colleagues talking about it, seeing people who I respect tweeting about it, or maybe I just needed some easy viewing on summer evenings. In the end, as well as being an evening wind-down, it unexpectedly triggered a few thoughts in the context of my role at the Mental Health Foundation. Now, the sun has set on the island, with Jack and Dani as the winners, I've put down some of these thoughts. There's little doubt that, among a certain age group, Love Island is becoming a great British TV institution, along the lines of The Apprentice or Bake Off (indeed, it hadhuge viewing figuresand a cinema inLondonderryeven sold out 440 tickets for the live final in just 45 minutes). But how could it affect the mental health of its viewers and its contestants? Throughout the series, I became more and more aware of the actions of producers and how what they were doing could be significantly harmful. Yes, it may sound like a spurious claim that reality TV producers can affect the mental health of the nation. But, actually, they can make a contribution. Our reportforMental Health Awareness Weekin May this year, told us that 47% of young people aged 18 to 24 have felt so stressed bybody imageand appearance that they have felt overwhelmed or unable to cope. This is even more pronounced in young women. Love Island selected 38 men and women for the series, who age between 20 and 31, and they're hardly a picture of body diversity. There isn't much in the way of fat rolls, cellulite, chubby bellies or visible disabilities on display. This can only serve to reinforce the stereotypical 'attractive' person and increase the number ofyoung peoplewhose mental health is affected by body image pressures. Likewise, the amount ofcosmetic surgeryundertaken by the contestants before they enter the villa is concerning. Many have spent thousands, if not tens of thousands, of pounds 'perfecting' their image. There are fake boobs, Hollywood smiles, nose jobs, lip jobs, fake eyebrows – no body part seems to have escaped treatment. Our Director, Isabella Goldie,wrote to ITVa few weeks ago expressing our concern about strategically placed cosmetic surgery adverts during the show, specifically targeting vulnerable young women. It was well reported that there were more applications for Love Island this year than there were for either Oxford or Cambridge universities.Martin Belam in the Guardianpointed out that far more people are eligible to appear on Love Island – but with the very small selection of body types, is that really the case in practice? It's hard to believe that among a reported 85,000 applications, there weren't any people who had a few curves, scars or stretch marks. But it's not just who is on the show – the content of the show also appears to take no account of mental health. The producers, it seems, are willing to do anything to create drama. I actually caught five minutes of the Love Island Review Show last Saturday night and they were counting down the most talked about moments of the series on social media. No doubt these are what the show measures its own success on, but it was noticeable that these moments almost exclusively included some kind of distress – sometimes artificially created by the producers. Samira, often isolated as the only black woman in the show, was struggling to find the right guy. When she did, she fell for Frankie and apparently spent a night in the 'Hideaway' with him – Love Island's only private bedroom. This wasn't shown to viewers and they subsequently voted him out and Samira was devastated. If the 'Hideaway' night was shown, the situation might have been different. On another occasion, the boys went off to spend two nights in another villa, 'Casa Amor'. The producers threw in an ex-fling of Jack's and told his villa partner Dani, who was understandably unhappy. What they didn't show her was that Jack didn’t go near his ex and slept outside, such was his commitment to Dani. Then there was the lie detector test, which wasn't carried out in the ideal way, making answers likely to be inaccurate. Again, the result was to create some artificial distress. Yes, all these examples were dramatic and entertaining, but it showed a disregard for the contestants' well-being. We shouldn’t take this lightly – the most serious mental health problems often start as something small, escalating into something more serious. Indeed, Alex and Alexandra's on-off relationship led to plenty of drama in the villa but it hardly needed the intervention of producers. The producers could be so much more creative and find ways to create entertainment and drama without artificially interfering.Relationship stressshouldn't be underestimated, as ourMental Health Awareness Week report from 2016said. So if all this is so wrong, why did I watch it? Because it was really entertaining... and dare you ask, were there were some good parts to it? Actually, yes. Although the show fuels the common perception of the perfect body, it does allow some insight that we often don’t see on the Instagram feeds of pop stars and models. It shows that not all is perfect. Talking about your feelings is one of the best things you can do to look after your mental health and a number of contestants have done this over the past few weeks. It's particularly refreshing to see young men opening up about their feelings and insecurities, as we know this group of people are far less likely to talk about their mental health, which ultimately contributes tosuicidebeing the most common cause of death for men under 45. We've all felt like Dr Alex who was finding it difficult to find a partner and he questioned whether there was something wrong with him, haven't we? Likewise, it's good to see the contestants at all times of day. We often see the girls with their makeup off and in their pyjamas, and so not espousing that 'perfect' image all of the time – even if they do feel the need to spend ages on their appearance and dress up every night. Despite these positives, there is a lot of work that the producers can do to acknowledge mental health as being a significant issue, which is especially important considering the target audience. Granted, my interest is fuelling the actions of the producers (and I did find myself a little worried it would become boring when everyone was 'coupled up'), but it's the producers who are in the positions of power here. They have a popular series, which has the ability to trash some of the stereotypes of 'attractive' people, promote body diversity, and to bring the issue of mental health and relationships to the fore. Here's hoping they take this on board for the 2019 series – if they do, I'll be watching.

Standing Together Cymruis a three-year Big Lottery-funded project working in partnership with four housing associations (United Welsh, Derwen Cymru, Newport City Homes and Melin Homes) across South East Wales. The project will establish 30 weekly peer support groups in retirement and extra care housing schemes. We will be running the groups for six months. The groups aim to deepen social connections and improve well-being. Standing Together Cymru is part of the work we do in our Programmes department on co-production. Co-production makes sure our participants have an active voice when it comes to the activities they take part in and the support they receive. We run peer group initiatives with different groups of people across the life course. Standing Together Cymru was born from theStanding Together London project. The Standing Together Cymru team have been facilitating groups since early February. ​Our group facilitators start each group with a 'getting to know each other' activity which leads to discussions on other topics and interests. We then design the subsequent sessions around the themes that the group bring up. This is just one example of how important it is for the groups to belong to the participants, rather than the people who run the group (facilitators).

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/general-election-mental-health-rising-policy-agenda,General election: mental health is rising up the policy agenda,"Read our policy calls for the 2024 UK general election The 2017 general election was billed as the Brexit election. But despite that focus, we continue to see mental health move up the political agenda and be recognised as one of the key challenges we face as a nation. Evidence for this shift can be seen in the increase in mentions of mental health in the party manifestos. The Conservative Party’s 2015 general election manifesto carried five mentions, which rose to 35 in 2017. Labour’s 2015 manifesto mentioned mental health four times, rising to 13 in 2017. While each party has a slightly different focus and set of priorities, the overarching tone across the 2017 manifestos was that this challenge must be addressed head-on with real solutions delivered, not just discussed. Importantly, mental health has been acknowledged in many manifestos as an issue that needs to be addressed across all government departments rather than just health, with policy pledges made across education, criminal justice and welfare, among others. This recognition begins to shine a light on the true scale of the challenge faced, and the resources required, to truly achieve parity between physical and mental health. It is vital that action comes from this rhetoric and that these pledges don’t remain ambitions. The King's Fund published findings that in 2015/16,40% of UK mental health trusts saw budgets cutwith further funds being redirected to other areas of the NHS. Further to this, last year's Mental Health Taskforce report also stressed that issues of parity continued to plague mental health services. We urgently need our politicians to start looking upstream to the root causes of such alarming rates of mental ill-health at the same time as supporting good well-being. Our latest reportSurviving or Thriving? The state of the UK's mental healthhighlights the scale of the challenge we face at both a national, and local level. We know that nearly two-thirds of people say that they have experienced a mental health problem. This rises to 7 in every 10 women, young adults aged 18 to 34 and people living alone. We are deeply concerned that only a small minority of people (13%) report living with high levels of good mental health, strengthening our calls for a revolution in thinking aboutprevention. In addition to the moral imperative for preventing people from needing to access mental health services, the economic case could not be stronger. It is estimated that mental health problems cost the UK economy £70 billion per year. We warmly welcome pledges such as the Conservatives' ambition to train one million members of the public in basic mental health awareness and first aid to break thestigma of mental illness, as well as Labour’s focus on working with communities, civil society and business to reduceloneliness. Both of these policies importantly shift the debate from a focus on service provision, and look to address the root causes of poor well-being and mental health. Ourresearchhas shown that arming the general public with the right information about mental health and well-being enables individuals to protect and sustain their own mental health, as well as those around them. The policies highlighted above are examples of real opportunities to target groups who face higher risk of mental health challenges, as well as the population, but for this to be a reality, we need this approach to be championed by our politicians after 8 June. While it is encouraging to see cross-party mental health champions establishing themselves, we urgently need to see this rhetoric in action: true policy shifts that accurately identify and support the most vulnerable in our society at the same time as promoting and supporting good mental health for all. These are the grounds upon which we must hold the next government to account. Our policy and advocacy work calls on national and local government to reduce the factors known to pose a risk to people’s mental health, enhance those known to protect it and create the conditions needed for people to thrive. In March 2017, commissioned by the Mental Health Foundation, NatCen conducted a survey amongst its panel members in England, Scotland and Wales. 7th May 2025

Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. A picture tells a thousand words. A common phrase but in an era flooded with images on our screens, in our pockets and in our minds, the power of the visual image to stir emotions has never been stronger. From the earliest traditions of wet plate image-making to the one-upmanship of Instagram dinners, photographs have always captured moments in time, enabling storytelling, recollection and discussion. But what does that mean for mental health? As a passionate photographer with lived experience of mental ill-health, working for a mental health charity, I often have a chance to discuss the links between the two. There are three areas of focus that come up for me the most. Photography as: These mix for me. I have always taken pictures and enjoyed writing, so nearly eight years ago, a colleague suggested that I try a daily photo journal on the Scottish photo-journaling siteBlipfoto. I got hooked and at the time of writing, I have published nearly 3000 successive daily images. In eight years, I have changed. I have gotten a lot better at photography. I have found opportunities to grow my skills to the extent that I actually believe in them. Along the way, I have spoken a lot about mental health in my journal. I have learned things about myself and hugely improved my well-being through developing talent and having a daily focus. Finding something (or someone) to photograph daily has become a helpful habit for me. It forces me to break away, get out and gain perspective. The return on this investment is much like the return from meditation: I am more at ease with myself than ever and my connection to places and people has grown. I’m comfortable with myself and my mental health these days, but reflecting on those thousands of entries, I see how my moods have changed, how I dealt with challenges and what I chose to share. Life has changed a lot but I find that I can orientate myself to the day and time with every image and I can track my life and my feelings by comparing the distance travelled between any two shots. In my day job, people often tell me that mental ill-health has robbed them of the memory of weeks or years and it is easy to see the value of journaling. Documentary photographers have always sought to find and tell stories, and whilst the subject and the story are always critical, the photographer’s interpretation and choice of image are crucial to the way the story is told. For me, relationships are key, and my eye is drawn to moments of connection between people. As well as my daily journal, I’ve been exploringthe photo essayas a way of telling stories. Whether it’s super artistic studio photography or Instagram with your phone, there’s a huge value in storytelling through images. We still face huge challenges in portraying mental health through pictures. Editors seek simple, evocative images and if that involves people clutching their heads or depicts methods ofsuicide, these images can reinforcestigmaor even encourage copycat behaviour. Pictures have always been controversial, and the ethics of photography in relation to mental health could be the subject of a long blog of its own. We certainly have a lot to explore regarding the impact of social media sharing and picture-making, and the extent to which the stories we share can trigger or upset the viewer. We explored a number of these topics as part of The Dust of Everyday Life Arts Conference in 2014.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/becoming-parent-hard-work,Becoming a parent is hard work,"Becoming a parent is hard work. No one said it would be easy. Becoming an adult is hard work too. That’s almost never easy either. Doing both at the same time? That’s double the challenge and it’s the challenge that young parents face. Many young mothers face additional challenges, on top of those that all parents may experience. For many young parents, coping with adversity was a part of life long before they became a parent. Young mothers are more likely to have experience in the care system or to have experiencedpoverty, domestic violence and disrupted family relationships in childhood. These adverse experiences in childhood can impact the mental health of mothers in any age group. Young mothers, however, are more likely than other age groups to have experienced these and other adversities in childhood. ""So the services weren’t that great because they're supposed to protect me, you know, protect that person and they didn't bother!"" I’m reminded of one mother, Luna, who attended her first-everYoung Mums Together groupin Haringey. Shy and withdrawn, she almost seemed to shrink into herself as she sat mutely with her baby boy. She wasn’t keen on participating in the activities. “I’m not a creative person,” she told us. She spent the session just listening quietly as the rest of the group talked and shared laughs. Nevertheless, Luna came back to the group every single week, gradually participating more and more in the games and crafts on offer. “We had a visitor from the Mental Health Foundation...I could ask her anything and she would give me the best advice and the other thing, she made us feel comfortable to talk about everything with her.” After attending the group for just three weeks, there was already an observable difference in Luna’s interactions with the group. She eagerly shared her ideas with the group, showing herself to be incredibly insightful. Luna particularly loved activities that involved messy play with her son – finger painting and sand play. Months later still, Luna felt confident enough to engage in training to be a Peer Supporter volunteer within her localYoung Mums Together group. She has continued on to university studies in her chosen career path and exudes a calm confidence in her interactions with her son. “Attending the groups, I just became more calm and more patient and more understanding.” Watching transformations like Luna’s, I’m struck by the realisation that seemingly simple things – craft activities and a supportive chat with peers – can have such dramatic effects on a young mother’s developing sense of self. “It helps me refocus on me and my mental health."" Creative activities with peers offer a chance for young mothers to express aspects of themselves, without needing to consciously express anything at all. In doing so, they are able to better understand and cope with complex and sometimes painful issues. Thepeer groupcontext provides acknowledgement that we are all undergoing the same process together. “I think the main thing was learning to learn about me, noticing my signal for stress and stuff like that and how much I can take on.” As this delivery stage of theYoung Mums Togetherprogramme draws to a close, I can’t help but think back to all the transformations I’ve witnessed, just like Luna’s. The stories differ and the experiences may vary but one thing is always consistent: I feel privileged to be a part of a programme that enables these young mothers to grow in confidence and discover their incredible potential. Young Mums Together is a 3-year programme to develop an innovative peer support model for young mothers (up to age 25) and their children. Young Mums Together groups offer a welcoming and comfortable environment for young mothers to engage in play with their children, enjoy disucssions, activities and a shared lunch with peers. Peer support is when people use their own experiences to help each other. 30th Oct 2025

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/motherhood-friendship-and-mental-health,"Motherhood, friendship and mental health: Tips from those in the know","This content mentions anxiety, which some people may find triggering. To markInternational Friendship Day, I sat down for a‘Tea & Talk’in Glasgow last weekend with four new mums to chat about the importance offriendshipfor their mental health. In 2011, the General Assembly of the United Nations officially declared 30th July as International Friendship Day, framing the power of friendship as a force to overcome adversity. ""To confront [the world’s] crises and challenges, their root causes must be addressed by promoting and defending a shared spirit of human solidarity that takes many forms — the simplest of which is friendship."" At the Mental Health Foundation, we strongly believe that friendships protect our mental health by building our capacity to cope with difficult situations and providing us with a support network. Becoming a mum, whether for the first time or with a growing family, can be a whirlwind that impacts our well-being both positively and negatively. According to Everyone’s Business, more than 1 in 10 women develop a mental illness in their baby’s first year. The rise of 'mummy bloggers' illustrates the growing appetite among mothers to hear and share their authentic experiences of motherhood. As we begin our conversation surrounded by six children aged between five weeks and six years, the nervous laughter at the sight of my note-taking suggests there’s an established ‘off the record’ norm to these conversations. But for one time only, these mums have agreed to share their tips on how to stay mentally healthy throughout motherhood. Each woman said that becoming a mum had actually brought new friends into their lives and built stronger foundations with current ones. ""Something natural develops between mums because they can relate to the same ages and stages that their children are going through. Even when there’s a group with a few mums, you gravitate towards people with a similar attitude."" The mums felt that the key to building positive new friendships was to be honest but also accept when someone isn’t the right fit. The most important and terrifying thing you can do is to put yourself out there either by popping along to a local mother and baby class or being the first one to suggest a coffee with a mum you’ve been sharing jokes with in class. ""It seems like dating at first – who makes the first move?!"" While friendships with other mums were said to be an incredible form of support, motherhood didn’t mean that friends without children were no longer relatable to these mums – rather they provide a different kind of support. Old friends can keep you connected with your interests before children and also present a non-judgemental and unbiased ear for your problems. ""Some of my older friends don’t have children but we’re still like-minded and they always help me feel more like myself."" The key to maintaining these older friendships where everyone is at different stages is to meet people halfway; be mindful and interested in the other person’s life and accept that you might not always ‘get’ each other. Whether recounting tales of painful or precious moments, the discussion was peppered with laughs and it was clear that a conversation with friends truly was the best antidote for the roller-coaster of family life. ""I think when you have your first baby, or if you’re the first friend to have a baby, then you have this constant thought in your head that says ‘Quick! I have to act normal!’"" Painting an honest picture of their lives helps these mums connect more quickly with other mums. But they also found solace in browsing 'mummy blogs' in the wee hours of the morning to keep connected to a global network of mums when their own local network was asleep (or trying to sleep). “When you speak to other mums you give up on trying to act like you did before having children. You begin to think 'what evenisnormal?'” While social media was praised as being helpful in keeping connected amidst a busy life, the mums raised a red flag around the importance of keeping it real and reminded each other that everyone shares their 'perfect' moments online. ""They could just be having a good hour – so never compare yourself to the lives of others on social media."" One thing these mums had in common was experiencinganxiety, either for the first time or more intensely, after becoming a mum. For some, this occurred while being overwhelmed by well-meaning visitors, others constantly worried about the safety of their child and one mum experienced increasingly obtrusive thoughts around an ever-growing to-do list. ""With my second child, I felt so anxious and unlike myself but it was only when I talked to a friend that I realised I could put a name to what I was feeling – I had anxiety."" It was conversations with friends that initially encouraged them to seek clinical help foranxiety. These discussions helped validate their experiences and make them more assertive when articulating their situation to adoctor. The take-home message was that friends can either give you the reassurance that what you are going through is normal or they can recognise from the outside that you are overwhelmed and should take further measures to look after your mental health. ""It's incredible how many people have told me about their anxiety problems once I opened up about mine. It’s totally empowering when it starts feeling like it’s 'we' instead of just 'me'."" Why not hold your own Tea & Talk and support the mental health of those around you while raising funds for the work of the Mental Health Foundation? Being a parent with a mental illness can be hard. But with the right support, you can be a good parent while managing your mental health. Friendship is a crucial element in protecting our mental health. Our friends can keep us grounded, help us get things in perspective, and help us manage the problems that life throws at us. 30th Oct 2025

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/mental-health-open-goal-next-prime-minister,Mental health is an open goal for the next Prime Minister,"History’s great political leaders have recognised the fundamental changes needed in society for people to flourish. The current political environment presents a myriad of priorities for the next Prime Minister, from Brexit, to social care, to climate change. While our country is more divided than ever, progress on mental health represents an issue that could unite us behind a common cause. But despite unprecedented public interest,Theresa May’s recent commitments, and the mounting evidence on the physical, social and economic impact that poor mental health is having on our nation, the contenders for PM have maintained a deafening silence on mental health. The cost of poor mental health is clear: almostthree-quarters of us experience a mental health problem in our lifetimeleading to anannual cost of almost £100 billion to our economy. But the opportunity is greater: good mental health enables us to fulfil our potential as individuals, as families, as communities and as a society. And the opportunities for improving our mental health are manifold: alongside improving mental health services, a focus onpreventionis the key to unlocking our collective potential (which would cascade through generations). Grasping the opportunity to make an enduring difference on mental health has the unusual virtue of both being socially just and electorally smart. Mental health is an issue that commands interest across the political spectrum. Outside of the Brexit negotiations, progress on mental health would contribute decisively to all the issues the UK public care most about – health, education, crime and the economy. Today, theMental Health Policy Group, an alliance of six national charities working together to improve mental health, has written to Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson calling on them to commit to taking action to improve mental health, as set out in our new manifesto “Towards Mental Health Equality.” Improving the nation’s mental health goes beyond the health service. As a priority, the new PM should set out a new cross-government plan for mental health, embedding a “mental health in all policies approach” and including commitments in areas such as criminal justice,housing, education and social care. This should be overseen by a Mental Health Cabinet Committee, ensuring that all new and existing policies are designed to benefit everyone’s mental health and improve the lives of people with mental health problems. The new Prime Minister should not only improve mental health services, but lead the world in having an equal focus onprevention. This would mean action to ensure that every school, higher and further education student receives mental health literacy lessons at every stage of their education and can get early support through their education provider. It would mean the expansion of evidence-basedparent support programmes, the development of self-management programmes to help parents with mental health problems and include support for their children. At the local level,every local authority now has a suicide prevention plan and many have a planfor better mental health. The new PM needs to ensure these plans lead to meaningful local action. Employers have a growing interest in mental health but need evidence-based guidance and incentives to support the mental well-being of their staff. The goal is wide open also to deliver a historic reform of the Mental Health Act.The Mental Health Act Reviewmade recommendations for legislation to reform the Act and close the gap in experiences and outcomes of different ethnic groups. The new Prime Minster must make sure this happens. To support the reforms, the government must invest in staff and build facilities that are fit for the 21st century. Good mental health is not an optional extra. Nothing is more important than maintaining and improving the mental health of the country. Investing in good mental health will have hugely positive effects if we get it right, and we can’t afford to get it wrong. The public knows this. The mental health goal is wide open. Will the next PM take the opportunity? In this manifesto from 2019, we set out five areas that the next Prime Minister must address in order to improve the lives of people with mental health problems and promote the mental health of the nation. The Mental Health Policy Group (MHPG) is an informal coalition of six national organisations working together to improve mental health through policy-influencing activities at the national level. Our policy and advocacy work calls on national and local government to reduce the factors known to pose a risk to people’s mental health, enhance those known to protect it and create the conditions needed for people to thrive. 7th May 2025

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/telling-tales-rotherhithe-babes,Telling the tales of the Rotherhithe Babes,"Written by Candy Worf, Group Facilitator,Standing Together project. It has been more than a year now since I first met with the Rotherhithe Babes, a group of southeast London cockney women in their late 80s and early 90s, sitting across from one another, reminiscing about the time Eileen had dressed up as a 'washer woman' to jump on top of Theresa's husband and embarrass him. They welcomed us to their coffee morning and after two slices of lemon drizzle and many stories about the finer pie and mash shops in the area - many of which have now closed down - we were told we could come again. This was the start of a unique side project that has taken us a year to pull off. On 11 May 2017, we launched their book, 'Our ups and downs: growing up and getting on with the Rotherhithe Babes' – a collective memoir of mischief, community and eccentric characters, along with tragedies, great loves and losses. It is a tangible legacy of their remarkable lives and of the work we do in theStanding Togetherproject. The Rotherhithe Babes are one group of great older women who have enjoyed each other's company over many decades. They talk with great humour about the changes they have seen in their world and their local area over their lifetimes. We have documented some of these stories in their book: Download the book The project aims to build support groups for tenants in retirement and extra-care homes, who may be lonely, having moved from their respective communities. All too often, I work with people with very few connections to the area they now live in and find that many people struggle to get out of their flats every day or to meet with their new neighbours. This of course was not the case for the Rotherhithe Babes, who have known one another for almost 50 years. Where all too often I find empty lounges with armchairs pushed against the walls, here there was laughter and noise, crude jokes that were interwoven with painful memories and people supporting one another through poor health – all the while making fun of one another for their poor memory! The Babes, (as they're now collectively known in our office) were giving of themselves in a way we hadn't experienced before. It was around four months into the project, after learning how old the Babes were (they are remarkably vivacious, ageless and active for their age) and how much they'd really achieved, that I realised we needed to record these stories. They are pertinent to all of us and especially to women. This oral history tells tales of harassment in male-dominated industries, raising families at a time of intense financial struggle, navigating a relationship with no wisdom imparted about their bodies and managing loss at a time when the country was determined to keep calm and carry on. These are unthinkable circumstances and yet the stories are so relatable and so human. There is a brutal and earnest truth to the way the Rotherhithe Babes talk, and it’s funny and meaningful and it makes you think about the past and what it is to be young today. That’s why I transcribed the dialect and the words just as they were spoken, they are as important as the messages in the stories. The Rotherhithe Babes are authentically themselves and have been their whole lives. I am so honoured to have an opportunity to share these stories and to know that like so much of the landscape of an ever-changing London, they will not be forever lost. The Standing Together Project aims to improve the emotional health and community connections of older people living in supported housing, as well as to reduce loneliness and isolation.

Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. Mark Rowland shares a powerful personal story and explains the importance of thriving with good mental health - our theme for this year's Mental Health Awareness Week. There was a look of concern written across my friend’s face. My marriage had dissolved some months earlier and I had just moved into a new flat. I hadn’t managed to buy furniture save for a single mattress on the floor and an empty red wine bottle standing idly beside it. We ate the lasagne I’d cooked with a spatula because I hadn’t managed to get cutlery yet. My friend could sense the scene matched my state - a pathetic fallacy reflecting my broken world. I thought back then that my life would be diminished from that point on, that it was permanently damaged. But the truth has been something different. I under-estimated the resources and support network that I had around me. That support turned an irredeemable failure into an experience that was ultimately empowering for me. Moving into that flat was the departure point, a fork in the road that opened life up, rather than closing it down. My view of surviving or thriving is not that these are two ends of a mental health spectrum. It’s not like a tug of war with prizes for those who are strong enough to pull through to thrive. Rather, it might be more accurate to see thriving and surviving as opposite points on a circle that feed into each other if we let them. An experience that requires surviving can pave the way for further understanding and that growth can strengthen our resilience for the struggles that are to come. Whether we are thriving or surviving or stuck somewhere in that cycle is not just down to us. Each of us has different backgrounds, resources, experiences and opportunities which affect our risk of mental ill-health and ability to thrive. That is why I am excited by city and region-led initiatives likeThrive West Midlandsto identify the role of local government, schools and employers in supporting better mental health. However, if we are going to develop a mentally healthy society, giving people the tools to thrive mentally is also fundamental. It is so important because none of us can escape life’s pain or disappointment. Resilience is a universal skill we all need to help each other learn to successfully navigate life. The good news is that resilience is not genetically inherited. It can be learned and strengthened (and shared). Our vulnerabilities and struggles don’t disqualify us; they can form the bedrock for good mental health. I have the privilege of working with colleagues whose very experience of mental ill-health has created a well of wisdom that has led them to better mental health. This is the heart of theself-management approachto mental health that we have often championed. Eminent psychologist Martin Seligman from the University of Pennsylvania has noted this pattern in the experience of servicemen in the AmericanArmed forces.Post-traumatic growthis a term used to describe the experiences of many soldiers who have found a greater level of solace and meaning in life following a period of loss andtrauma. Of course, we also know that trauma can lead to another cycle - to long periods of mental ill-health and evensuicide. Given we will all face difficult times, we are left with an urgent question: how we can increase our collective experience of post-traumatic growth? Our starting point is that we need to design modern life with good mental health in mind. It wasJohn Maynard Keynes who predictedthat advances in technology would led us to vastly expanded leisure time and a 15-hour work week. Instead, our technology has meant a seeping ofworkinto every corner of our lives. It’s one example of where we’ve failed to make good mental health easier to achieve and people are living the consequences. As outlined in ourFundamental Facts about Mental Health, in 2014, 19.7% of people in the UK aged 16 and older showed symptoms ofanxietyordepression– a 1.5% increase from 2013. ThisMental Health Awareness Week, we are flipping the focus away from mental ill-health to exploring how we can cultivate good mental health. It is an opportunity to reflect on the strategies and resources we need to shape a coherent national approach to public mental health and the tools we need our families and our communities to radically re-frame our ability to thrive in life. During the week of 8 to 14 May 2017, we will be producing a new report to highlight the numbers of us who feel stuck on 'survive'. We will be providing advice and insight into how we can build good mental health in the context of our work, our digital world, our parenting approach and in our communities. We will be calling on the government to do more to promote better mental health. Human beings are probably the most resilient creatures on the planet. Through countless setbacks, we have learnt how to survive but we are only now starting to understand how to thrive.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/stress-its-time-talk,Stress: it's time to talk,"This content mentions suicide or suicidal thoughts, self-harm, substance abuse and addiction (which may include mentions of alcohol or drug use), depression and anxiety. Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. Over 20 years ago, my good friend and flatmate died bysuicide. We knew he was under pressure to finish his degree. We knew he was drinking too much. In retrospect, the signs were all there. But he never felt able to talk about hisstressor hissuicidal thoughtsto his family, girlfriend or friends. And so our campaign this month makes me reflect upon how far we still have to go. It is difficult for anyone to open up to others but it is so difficult for men as too often in our culture it is seen as a personal weakness or dismissed as pressures of everyday life. To really improve things, we need to do three things: we must address the conditions that create stress; we must shift the culture so thatmenfeel that it is safe and acceptable to seek help; and we must ensure that when men do speak up they get a compassionate and helpful response from friends, families, colleagues and services. This month’s campaign is about shifting the culture but with some clear directions for action. Stress is a critical social problem. It leads to suicides and mental health problems. It damages the lives of people who are affected, it also has a wider impact upon families, friends and colleagues. Men can be particularly affected. This is partly due to the stressful situations and workplaces where they spend time, but they are also less willing to seek help when they experience overwhelming pressure and loss of control in their lives. Chronic stress is even more damaging and leads to major physical illness. Our research shows that over one-third of men have felt so stressed that they have had suicidal thoughts. Rather than turn to those close to them, too many men turn toalcohol: nearly one-third of men use alcohol to cope. This creates a vicious cycle exacerbatingdepressiveandanxiousthoughts and feelings. The result is that Scotland has one of the highest rates of suicides across the UK and some of the highest rates ofself-harm, violence, mental illness and premature mortality in Europe. We all have a responsibility to do what we can to change this. Employers and policymakers must address the social conditions that lead to stress. We must challenge poor workplace conditions, precarious employment contracts,poverty,debtand punitivewelfare systems. These are all ingredients that combine to create toxic conditions for stress. But stress is something that everyone has to deal with at stages of their life. So we have to shift the culture so that men can be open and comfortable disclosing when the pressure gets too much and seeking help. It is too easy to belittle stress and confuse it with pressure, weakness or a lack of personal resilience. In practice, we can start in schools. In this formative stage for boys, mental health and well-being should be at the heart of what they learn. We will also lobby the media to take stress seriously. And we will encourage workplaces to be responsive and compassionate to all staff.

There are things we can all do in situations where we are worried about someone who we think may be at risk of suicide. Talking can really make a difference. If you’re feeling suicidal, you’re not alone: one in five of us think about suicide in our lifetimes. Remember that these feelings won’t last. There is help available to keep you safe now and to help with the problems that may be causing your suicidal feelings. In England, around one in eight men has a common mental health problem such as depression, anxiety, panic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Stress is the feeling of being overwhelmed or unable to cope with mental or emotional pressure. 29th Oct 2025

Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. A blog by Stuart Hill. Last summer, quite surprisingly, I found myself watching nearly every episode of Love Island. At the time, I wasn’t aware I was going toblogon it for the Mental Health Foundation at the end of the series, never mind write a follow-up piece a year later. But the events of the past year have shone thespotlight on reality TV– and not in the way that the producers would have wanted. Important points have been made about the lack of concern for mental health around these shows. Sadly, as the new 2019 series of Love Island approaches, the early evidence is that very little has been learned. Let’s start with a positive. During last summer’s show, it came to our attention that acosmetic surgery companywas showing online adverts targeted specifically at young women and girls. They painted the picture of the ‘perfect’ body and encouraged their audience to aspire to the ‘Love Island look’. Research by the Foundationhas shown that millions of teenagers and young people are feelingstressed, overwhelmed and unable to cope because they don’t feel comfortable with the way they look. These adverts exploited that. However,we complainedto the Advertising Standards Agency, who ruled that the advert breached advertising rules. So, we shouldn’t be seeing similar adverts this year, which is good news. However, I mentioned in my piece last year that producers needed to be a bit more imaginative with the people who they choose to take part in the show. We have just hadMental Health Awareness Weekwith a focus onbody image. This would have been a good opportunity for a popular TV show to make a positive statement on body image by selecting a cast of people with all types of bodies. It’s no surprise that this hasn’t been the case. By the looks of things, there arevery few relatable bodies going onto the island– there are certainly no curves, stretch marks or scars in sight. The producers are doing nothing to dispel the myth that the most attractive people all look a certain way. They have the power to put across a message that says a few fat rolls or a bit of cellulite doesn’t make someone unattractive - and yet, year after year, they waste that chance! It’s not just who the producers cast on the show that needs more consideration, the way the show is conducted needs some serious thought. Last year, I was struck by the obsession with engineering controversy and situations on the show that would no doubt impact on contestants’ mental health. I didn’t even know the half of it at the time. Listening toJonny Mitchell on the Guardian’s Today in Focus podcast, some of what goes on behind the scenes is jaw-dropping. I thought the producers had little regard for the mental health of the contestants, and listening to Mitchell emphatically confirmed this. Mitchell himself had body image issues which he had articulated to producers and these were purposely exploited in the show when he was forced to read out that only 12% of viewers found him attractive. Mitchell was on the Guardian’s podcast soon after his friend and former contestant Mike Thalassitis had taken his own life. There are a number of reasons why people decide toend their livesand it is a complex topic. But people close to him believe Thalassitis’s decision was due to a number of issues that arose out of Love Island. As I write this, the 2019 series is about to start. I hope that there are big changes here but this is doubtful. Well, ITV has said that there will be psychological support on hand during and after the show for anyone who needs it. This is a stunning misreading of the situation. If you are producing a show which requires so much psychological support to be necessary, you really need to give the show a rethink. There may be a place for it, but its current form clearly isn’t working. Sadly (like with the Jeremy Kyle Show) it’s taken someone to lose their life for people to take notice and even then the response is not good. We need to bepreventingmental ill-health, not pushing people’s well-being to its limits and then picking up the pieces.

Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. The Mental Health Foundation has been instrumental in bringing the ‘Thrive’ approach of tackling the causes of mental ill-health in cities to the UK. Today, the Foundation, in partnership with Thrive LDN, launches theLondoners Saidreport, distilling over 1000 conversations about what would better support people in the capital to live happier, healthier lives. This marks a great step forward in our efforts to truly involve citizens in decision-making about how communities can work better for everyone. It is an approach the Foundation is also working with others across the UK on including a formal partnership with Thrive West Midlands. In July 2017, London Mayor Sadiq Khan launched Thrive LDN to improve the ‘health and happiness’ of Londoners by addressing the causes of mental ill-health. We were commissioned to map London boroughs according to a number of factors that indicated the level of mental health inequalities in that area. The research was subsequently published inLancet Psychiatry. Prioritising the boroughs most in need the Foundation and Thrive LDN then designed and delivered a series of community conversations bringing together residents, service providers, commissioners, charities and businesses. In all, we held 17 of these conversations in half of all the London boroughs with over 1000 Londoners, who told us how we could best work together to deliver Thrive LDN’s six aspirations, which had been co-produced with London citizens and experts. The solutions those Londoners came up with share common themes – namely, to spread knowledge, skills and support so that people can better look after themselves and their neighbours. Instead, they want the tools and networks to do it for themselves. This report provides insights and feedback from each of the community conversations held. Recommendations have been developed for all partners and supporters of Thrive LDN to consider. We believe this process of community consultation and the recommendations below can be used elsewhere in the UK and we would welcome the chance to work with other communities elsewhere in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. You cansign up to receive Thrive LDN updatesand we would welcome your feedback and response to the ideas set out below.

Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. The concept of me trekking the Great Wall of China was initially just a passing comment from my brother who works for the Mental Health Foundation. I had previouslyrun the London Marathon for the Foundationand when they first got places to participate in the 2017 China challenge, he sent me the link saying, ‘you ran a marathon!’ I have never been one to decline a challenge, so a couple of weeks later I signed up. The Foundation is a charity very close to my heart. I have friends and family members who have experienced mental health problems – some of whom have managed to overcome these difficulties and some who sadly found it too hard to cope. On the one hand, I have celebrated with people who now have lives far removed from the problems they once faced and, on the other, I have attended the funerals of friends who felt there was no way out, nobody to talk to, no other option. My older brother is a success story. He was diagnosed withbipolarwhen I was just eight years old. I was too young to understand what was happening, but I knew something was. We have always been close, and I remember worrying so much about him. As soon as I was old enough to understand, I researched mental health, trying to grasp what he was going through. Fast forward 22 years and he owns a house, has a wonderful partner, two amazing little girls, and a life of which most people would be envious. In recent years, with the stresses of adult life, break-ups, make-ups and the constant pressures of living and working in London, I have had mental health difficulties of my own. I have always had mildanxiety, which worsens every now and again, and the life I lead – while I love it – can be detrimental to my mental state. In my line of work, I see colleagues working 18+ hours a day, seven days a week, constantly putting themselves under pressure and striving for success, anextremely stressful environmentwhich could break even the strongest and most stable of people. There is a great focus on looking after your physical health with the competitiveness of business only matched by the competitiveness of fitness. People in the office talk about the physical challenges they are facing and openly discuss injuries or the need to see a physio. The same cannot be said for mental health. In an environment which breedsstressanddepression, nobody would openly talk about suffering or if they were seeing a counsellor or therapist. However, things are beginning to change and thestigmasurrounding mental health is certainly beginning to lift. There is still a way to go and this is where the Foundation comes in. The work they do to raise awareness and reduce stigma is invaluable, fighting for it to be acceptable to talk about problems and encouraging people not to be ashamed to seek help before they get worse. They rely purely onpublic donationsand grant funding, and I will continue raising money for them for as long as I am able. It has been proven that there is a direct link between positive mental health and positive physical health. If I can create afitness regimeand stick to it, then my mood lifts incredibly. But getting to the gym in the first place is a struggle if all I want to do is stay in bed. It is a vicious circle. I have found that having a challenge to work towards helps me massively. Once I had signed up for the Great Wall of China trek, I wanted to train as I didn’t want to fail. I wanted to succeed, and I wanted to succeed with my head held high. The trek was tough and I was glad I had trained. I have never climbed as many stairs as I did in China. But the views at the top, over the Great Wall and the rolling mountains of the Chinese countryside are sights and memories which will be engraved in my memory forever. The feeling of pride and elation when you reach the summit, which a few hours ago looked so high it could have been in heaven, can only be compared to the feeling I had when I crossed the finish line of the marathon. (Maybe it will be matched by having children, but I am yet to do that – one day!) At the end of every day, I felt proud of myself and what I was accomplishing. I met some amazing people who will be my friends forever. We pulled each other through. As with life, we all hit walls at different times. But it is admitting when you’re struggling and allowing others to help you - that is the secret. Actually, at times focusing on others helped distract me from the fact that I was panicking! At the beginning of the trip, we were strangers but by the end, we were friends and confidants. We all started as a team and we all finished as a team. Trekking the Great Wall of China is one of the best things I have ever done. Apart from giving me the chance to travel one of the most beautiful countries I have ever seen, it gave me motivation and determination and it focused my mind on something which mattered to me. On top of all that, I raised a lot of money for the Mental Health Foundation. Win-win! I would do it again in a heartbeat! Now… on to the next challenge!

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/recovering-multiple-bereavements-through-creative-practice,Recovering from multiple bereavements through creative practice,"This content mentions death and bereavement, which some people may find triggering. Professor Paul Crawford tells his story of how he recovered while facilitating a Creative Practices for Mutual Recovery class. It was during a two-day visual arts workshop [1] that I found myself being part of the evidence for 'mutual recovery' in an unexpected and striking way. Recoveryin a traditional sense is when somebody identified as having a need or being 'ill' is recovered by whatever means – in mental health, this is often through creative practices. This approach often overlooks hard-pressed informal carers and health, social care and education personnel, who may also need to 'recover' or be 'recovered' in terms of their own mental health and well-being – this is where mutual recovery comes in. As the leading researcher for both pieces of research into mutual recovery through creative practices, I did not anticipate any kind of recovery would happen to me! I was just the research leader, right? I had recently endured multiple and far-reaching bereavements that meant I lost most of my family and I greatly empathised with the people withdementiaand their carers taking part in our new study. Their personal struggle with memory, identity and day-to-day connectedness chimed with the void in my life. In an exploratory phase of creating art on the first day, I found myself picking up a piece of double-sided colour paper and gradually tearing it in a circular motion, watching it form a spiral reaching down towards the floor. In the middle, I ripped out the last piece of paper and held it between my thumb and finger. I looked at it but didn’t quite know what it might mean. I gathered up the square of paper and placed it back on the table. Now the sheet of paper is presented as a vortex with a hole in the middle. I looked at it and, once again, wondered what to do with the tiny scrap of paper that I held. I decided to place it on one side of the 'vortex' as if it were coming out or just escaping it. I thought nothing more of this spontaneous and rather pleasing creation and continued with the rest of the activities. On day two, we all visited the Djanogly Gallery at the University of Nottingham and participated in a discussion led by Chris Lewis Jones on Victor Pasmore's painting 'The Snow Storm'. I did not know in advance that this painting, which represented 'vortices', would be the subject of the discussion. It seemed really odd that the day before I had pre-figured a vortex in my own creative work! After the discussion, we all joined together to continue making art that represented things we wanted to convey to the rest of the group. I returned to the 'vortex' theme and created a new work from a black and white square of double-sided paper. Again, I ripped my way into the middle and placed the little piece to one side of the 'exit' from the main square. This was then mounted on white paper and exhibited alongside the works of all the other participants. I framed it and hung it on the wall. When I hung it on the wall, I began to realise what I had created – or rather, gained a sense of what meaning it had for me. I realised that the black vortex was the grief experienced in the multiple losses I had so recently endured – a great force pulling me inwards and likely to consume me or leave me in a state of denial. The hole in the middle was the traumatic wrench of myself from all I knew before and the little scrap just outside of the vortex was me making my bid for a new and changed life. I called the work 'Escaping the Vortex' and it was a key part of my recovery. Now I have begun to accept and live with the hole in the middle – it doesn’t go away – but I have chosen the future, I am moving away from the debilitating power of the vortex. I will be forever grateful that, in leading the programme of research into Creative Practices for Mutual Recovery, I had this curious opportunity to advance my own mental health and well-being. I hope people take seriously the potential for 'mutual recovery' through creative practices. The peer-reviewed science, social science and arts and humanities findings that support this are in place. Now I offer myself as a curious, albeit anecdotal, case of transformation. Find out how different creative arts practices can be used for mutual recovery [1] The visual arts workshop was from the Dementia Arts and Wellbeing programme, funded by AHRC and adopting the Creative Practice as Mutual Recovery Approach. 11th Sep 2025

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/how-archers-showing-impact-whole-family-when-loved-one-goes-prison,"How ""The Archers"" is showing the impact on the whole family when a loved one goes to prison","This content discusses trauma, depression and anxiety, which some people may find triggering. This week, 'The Archers' listeners witness Elizabeth’s struggles and initial acceptance of her deteriorating mental health, as the impact of her son Freddie’s prison sentence finally overwhelms her. But for others, what are the implications for the whole family when a loved one goes to prison? How can life carry on as normal? There is a range of powerful emotions that come into play when a loved one goes to prison, including shame and guilt. A grandmother once told me about how her grandson’s incarceration played out in her family. He was visited by his mother and siblings but he couldn't bear for his grandparents to visit him yet. This was even though he knew how she felt: “We all love him, we all nurture and cherish him. What he’s done is not the same as who he is”. This is also the case for how the character Elizabeth feels about her son and his actions, yet recently she couldn’t bring herself to visit him on his birthday. This was a huge red flag that her mental health was deteriorating, but it wasn’t obvious to herself or those close to her. It won’t always be appropriate for families to visit. For most families though, there are also the physical barriers to seeing someone who is spending time behind bars. For some, there is the cost and practicalities of visiting people in prison, far away from home. For families on benefits, there is assistance that you can findhere. It’s incredibly complicated managing long-distance visits around increased family responsibilities and work. Then there is the anguish of parents being separated from their children - as is so powerfully depicted in the filmIf Beale Street Could Talk. The anger, pain and loss may have inter-generational mental health implications, which are another large cost for society. In prisons, there is a huge challenge to managing the mental health needs of prisoners. The Institute of Psychiatry estimates that in England and Wales over half of prisoners have common mental disorders includingdepression,post-traumatic stress disorderandanxiety. At the Mental Health Foundation, we ran a project inParc men’s prison in Wales. One of the approaches that we have specialised in ispeer supportandself-management. This has resulted in us currently co-producing a booklet with prisoners. The booklet will have tips on ways to improve your mental health in prison, including: We do hope that Elizabeth feels able to visit Freddie soon as personal family contact is crucial for both of their mental health. As this blog says, we can support prisoners with their mental health through our guides. But we can't do it by ourselves. We need your help to move us forward to enable us to provide more support. Please consider a donation today. This self-management programme ran between 2013 to 2016 with courses on mental health for inmates of the UK prison environment for the first time at HM Prison Parc, Bridgend in South Wales. This guide provides you with tips on how to look after your mental health in prison. 11th Sep 2025

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/halloween-horror-brings-out-best-online-campaigning,Halloween horror brings out the best in online campaigning,"Last night brought to the attention of the mental health world an appalling example ofstigma. George (Asda's clothing line), and a range of other retailers, were stocking 'mental patient' or 'psycho ward' Halloween costumes. In the case of Asda, the caption read: ""Everyone will be running away from you in fear in this mental patient fancy dress costume. Comprising of a torn blood stained shirt, blood stained plastic meat cleaver and gory facemask it’s a terrifying Halloween option."" In the case of Tesco, the theme was more reminiscent of a high-security prison, with an orange jumpsuit and face mask and 'complete the look' suggestions including gory knives and teeth sets. Clearly, both of these approaches are offensive, literally stigma in its purest sense, playing on a stereotyped public impression of mental health which many thought we had moved on from. When the image and Asda link went viral on social media on last night, there was a general outcry from all sectors, led by individuals with mental health problems. The major charities, such as SAMH and Time to Change partner Rethink, also picked it up. Complaint details for Asda were crowdsourced by those following the story on Twitter, and Asda's Twitter feed and complaints system was deluged. Within two hours of the link going viral, Asda took the costume off sale, issued a public apology to customers it had upset and offered a sizeable donation toMind. This swift action is commendable and must be recognised and credited. Of course, other retailers should follow suit immediately, and withdraw similarly themed costumes, with apologies. They should also all be agreeing to train their buyers and merchandisers. Firstly, it is far from inspiring that this kind of thing is still happening. Asda has a reputation as being a good employer for disabled people, including those with mental health problems. I have used their staff facilities to hold mental health sessions, and they support numerous community initiatives. Yet this kind of costume was approved for sale by a team and a manager somewhere. We need to aim to equip everyone with a basic understanding of mental health to understand that this is wrong. People with mental health problems are far more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators. Regardless of this, we need to ask ourselves what other marginalised groups could, in 2013, be objectified in this way at Halloween. People used to think Black people were dangerous and scary, but blessedly it has been generations since any decent person, let alone a retailer, would believe or promote this idea. As a mental health movement, we should aspire to this end. In this case, the retailer should have instinctively dismissed this at the planning meeting where somebody suggested a mental health horror costume. My second point is the point of pride and excitement at the fact that people power led by those with lived experience created an upswell of action that created visible change they could all see and swept the story onto the BBC and ITV news agenda by midnight. They did not need PR support or encouragement from mental health charities and anti-stigma campaigns. Most of the charities were not online, though those that were were using their voice well to support the individuals with key messages and pointers. By midnight, the day was won, and at least within Asda, a corporate mind was changed by citizen action mobilised to address stigma. People could see the change they sought, and I hope it made them proud. Certainly, some people were tweeting what they were wearing, as examples of what 'mental patient costumes' actually were. I certainly thought that trick-or-treat for mental health awareness was a good idea. This was a social media victory but we need to remember that not everyone with mental health problems has access to technology. So we must find ways of sharing the good feeling of achieving a change with them and find ways for them to feel that buzz. Over the next three years, from November, the Foundation and the Scottish Association for Mental Health will be taking forward the renewed Scottish anti-stigma programme 'See me' into a new phase. The Scottish Government and Comic Relief are investing £4.5 million over three years to address the social injustice and multiple inequalities faced by people with mental health problems via the'See Me' anti-stigma programme. The campaign will shift gear, building on the traction from ten years of anti-stigma work to date. The focus will be on human rights and the mobilisation of a social movement of those with a connection to mental health, to address stigma and discrimination at community level. We want to make sure that the three in four people who don't directly experience mental health problems understand and stand up for the one in four who do. We need to recognise too that the effect of stigma and discrimination is felt by families, mental health professionals and society as a whole, when people can't fulfil their potential or die through not being able to come forward for help. Discrimination in mental health is a four-in-four issue. The lessons from last night highlight the need for strong anti-stigma programmes to continue. Even more so, they show the potential for people to mobilise and create change they can see with only the lightest of touches from campaigning organisations. The huge task the renewed programme will face means that creating real change will mean rely on ordinary people to amplify the messages the campaign will help them generate, as no central campaign can create enough momentum alone to make the difference in hearts and minds we need to see. But last night felt like the morning after The Sun published the 'Bonkers Bruno' headline. Something feel different. Like stigma has a bloody nose because many ordinary people said 'not OK' together. People with mental health problems say that stigma and discrimination can make their difficulties worse and make it harder to recover. It is perhaps not surprising that an area of health that has been so systematically stigmatised for so many decades has historically settled for a discriminatory lexicon. Generations of people have grown up in societies that found terms like “psycho”, “schizo”, “loonie” and “crazy” perfectly acceptable. There are no results that match your filtered options.

This Mother’s Day, I’m feeling particularly grateful to the NHS services who enabled me to carry on mothering my children through our darkest hour. Last July, in theaftermath of the Brexit vote, I suffered from a hypomanic episode, which degenerated intopsychosisas I became more and more deprived ofsleep. A happy time it was not! But it definitely helped me to appreciate my own ability to look after my children – and the mothering skills of the fantastic team that took care of me. I was fortunate to be admitted to the Coombe Wood mother and baby unit in Acton, one of only three wards in London where mothers can remain with their babies whilst in the midst of major psychological distress. With a breastfed baby who was no fan of weaning, it was a godsend to be able to stay with my daughter and have help looking after her – and to have some help looking after me too. The team at Coombe Wood were amazing, and I find it hard to believe that there’s a mother of a young baby anywhere in the land who wouldn’t benefit from spending some time there. One of the special things about Coombe Wood is that the staff come from so many different disciplines. There are psychiatrists, psychotherapists, occupational health workers, nurses and (perhaps most importantly) nursery nurses – who can support mothers and babies together from a holistic perspective. Some of the practical mothering skills they shared were critical: after eight months with a baby who only seemed capable of sleeping in my armpit, we finally got her sleeping on her own in a cot! The other special thing about Coombe Wood was the opportunity to spend time with other women who were also in the midst of a mental health crisis. It was inspiring to be surrounded by these brave, strong women, coping with such difficult circumstances. It’s a community I feel very proud to be part of. As a family, we have reflected a lot on what could have been done to prevent my illness. It was a possibility we had prepared for: I have abipolar diagnosisand had been told that I had a one in three chance of becoming unwell when I had my baby. In my case, the key factor seemed to be the underfunding of early intervention services, which were unable to respond when my husband and I first raised the alarm about my health. In the delay, a problem became a crisis and the crisis quickly spiralled out of control. They say it takes a village to raise a child, and this Mother’s Day, I’m grateful to the team of people who supported me when motherhood got tough – and prevented a bad situation from becoming even worse. My baby daughter will never remember Coombe Wood, but my husband and I will never forget it. Being a parent with a mental illness can be hard. But with the right support, you can be a good parent while managing your mental health. Forming a family and parenting is an important part of life, with many changes taking place. Both mothers’ and fathers’ mental health may be affected during this transition, which may influence their child’s mental health. 30th Oct 2025

Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. Written by Helen Undy, Head of External Affairs, Money and Mental Health Policy Institute. Over the last few years, mental health has had a meteoric rise, not just in the number of headlines about celebrities and royals sharing their experiences, but also in the slightly less glamorous world of policy-making. It would have been hard to believe a few years ago, but mental health policy is now a vote-winner - and with a new election on the horizon, that creates an opportunity to push for real change. Because, while policies focusing on improving access to mental health treatments have rightly been at the top of the agenda, there’s been something noticeably missing:prevention. We wouldn’t talk about treatment for cancer without tackling its causes and the same should be true for mental health. Our ambitions should be just as high. At theMoney and Mental Health Policy Institute, our research has thrown stark light on the impact that financial difficulties can have on our mental health. This won’t come as a surprise to many - facing a sudden drop in income through redundancy or sickness absence is stressful, scary and intimidating. Dealing with phone calls or visits from bailiffs can be terrifying, causing real and immediate distress. And trying to make ends meet when you just aren’t earning enough to pay the bills can take all the time and energy you have to give. But what may come as a surprise is the sheer scale of the impact. People in problemdebtare twice as likely to have seriousdepression. People who have experienced a financial crisis in the last six months are nearly eight times as likely to think aboutsuicide. Supporting people to avoid, or to deal with, financial difficulty could have a significant impact on the prevalence of mental health conditions in Britain, as well as helping those who are living with them to recover and to live with dignity. That’s why Money and Mental Health Policy Institute has just published its ownmanifesto, calling on the next government to grasp the nettle and take action. With mental health services already bursting at the seams and the number of people in problem debt set to rise, we can't afford to wait. We want to see the next government take preventative steps including: We’d also like to see money and benefits advice made available through the NHS alongside mental health treatment for all those who are struggling with their finances so that we can tackle the 'recovery gap' between those with problem debts and those without. All of the major political parties have stated their commitment to mental health, and I’m sure they will all put out press releases forMental Health Awareness Weekreinforcing the importance of tackling stigma and starting conversations. That’s a good start, but what would really make a difference to the people anxiously working out if they can afford to turn the heating on, to those facing the financial cliff edge of redundancy or avoiding opening the post, is some practical action. This week, let’s raise more than awareness: let’s raise our expectations. I want our next government to be as ambitious about preventing mental health problems as we are.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/when-are-we-going-ditch-m-word,When are we going to ditch the M-word?,"This content mentions death or bereavement, anxiety and depression, which some people may find triggering. We’ve come a long way in public mental health in recent years. Part of the ground that we have covered – towards making a difference in how mental health problems are perceived and how people with lived experience can be supported – is because of our concentrated efforts to tackle thestigmaof ill health. The language that we use is fundamental to that. We have managed, as a society, to move away fromstigmatising and discriminatoryterms like 'mental', 'maniac' and 'madman'. But what about 'murderer'? Last night’sBBC Panorama programme'A prescription for murder?' has unhelpfully triggered the same discussion again. The programme went, at length, to investigate some cases of people who have committed homicides and attempted to explore a causal link between mental health problems andSSRI medication. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a type of widely prescribed drug aiming to decrease symptoms ofanxietyanddepressionby increasing the levels of serotonin in the brain (serotonin is a chemical messenger that transfers signals between neural cells and the brain). The programme provided case studies and interviews with families of victims and clinicians. Unfortunately, those of us working in public health know that relying on individual case studies to draw generalised conclusions is poor practice. In fact, we dedicate our careers to building the evidence base that will help us make good – both clinical and non-clinical – decisions and recommendations. Most past observational studies or reviews of randomised controlled trials have been inconclusive. Some of these studies have reported outcomes such as hostility and aggression, but have not shown that this would translate into harder outcomes, like violence. In a2015 Swedish study, the largest of its kind, researchers examined data from more than 850,000 individuals with linked data from prescriptions and crime databases. They found that for about 80% of people who were prescribed SSRIs, there was no clear association with violent crime. Their use, though, resulted in an increased risk for violent behaviours among young people aged 15 to 24 years. However, when attempting to interpret this finding, the researchers added that this is not a conclusion that should be taken out of context. Young people sometimes withdraw frommedicationand this leads to side effects. Also, in the study, a lot of young people received sub-therapeutic doses (i.e. not adequate), and hence may have developed symptoms due to that. In addition, when some younger people start taking this medication, they feel better and may start misusing alcohol, which we know can lead to aggressive behaviour. Thus, in essence, the best available evidence tells us to be very careful with the prescription and patterns of use of anti-depressants in adolescents. This is largely the case for any prescribed medication. In countries like the UK and the US, almost 1 in 10 people receive an anti-depressant. In such large populations, patterns of adverse effects of that seriousness are almost always evident in the data that are routinely collected and analysed. To the best of our knowledge,psychosisis a very rare side effect of anti-depressive medication, and only an incredibly small sub-percentage of those developing such symptoms may become violent. The problem with programmes like 'A prescription for murder?' is that they contribute to sustaining a conversation that presents people experiencing mental health problems as violent and dangerous. And such portrayals in the media can be powerful in shaping the thinking of viewers. Over a third of the wider public think that people with mental health problem are likely to be violent. Contrary to this popular belief, recent studies have shown that the rates of homicides committed by people diagnosed with mental health problems have remained reasonably stable since the 1990s. In fact, people with severe symptoms are much more likely to be the victims, rather than the perpetrators, of violent crimes, and the vast majority of violent crimes, including homicides, are not committed by people who have mental health problems. While the programme attempted to use appropriate language where possible, encouraged the open publication of pharmaceutical data and included advice to viewers to not stop any medication, it overall begged the question: why do we need programmes themed and framed like this? Who would actually benefit from watching? Surely, topics only peripherally mentioned, like gun availability and violence in the United States, are more urgent public health concerns. Withnearly two-thirdsof us have experienced a mental health problem in our lifetime, it’s time we shift all our focus and efforts to the real public mental health challenges of inequalities andprevention.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/how-understand-and-cope-stress-stress-awareness-day,How to understand and cope with stress this Stress Awareness Day,"This content mentions death or bereavement, substance abuse and addiction (which may include mentions of alcohol or drug use), depression, anxiety and trauma, which some people may find triggering. We all feel stress, and this isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Stress can motivate us, make us more alert, and help us perform better in certain situations, such as job interviews or competing in sports events. But stress is only good for us if it’s short-lived.Dealing with stressover long periods of time can be harmful, potentially leading to mental health problems likeanxietyordepression. This Stress Awareness Day is a chance for us to understand more about stress and what we can do about it. The stress response is a survival strategy to keep us safe. Humans have evolved this as a vital response to avoid being eaten by predators. When our brains sensed danger, it would shut down unnecessary functions and flood our blood with glucose, giving us a power surge to make our muscles respond in one of two ways: fight or flight. Today, we are less likely to be at risk of being eaten, but our response to situations where we are under pressure beyond our control is still the same. Many of us feel this response repeatedly every day, so instead of escaping the bear and finding safety, it’s like being chased by the bear every day with no let-up. If you are trying to cope with stressful situations every day, this constant state of fight or flight can harm your mental and physical health. These feelings of abnormal pressure can be brought on by things likebereavement, anincreased workload, family arguments, othertraumatic events, or evenfinancial worries. Over the last few years, stress has been something that most of us have become familiar with. The challenges ofthe pandemic, closely followed by the increasingcost-of-living crisis, have put huge pressure on most of us. The burden of struggling to meet everyday costs like heating, groceries, and transport is also chipping away at our mental health. What makes matters worse is how much of this is out of our control. Incomes haven’t risen in line with prices for many years, and this is being felt particularly by people who were already experiencing financial strain, any practical solutions like reducing spending or increasing income may have already been maxed out. We need our governments to act to make sure that every person, family, and community has enough money to live a healthy life and to get high-quality public services. The Mental Health Foundation will continue to push for policy changes across all government departments, making sure that people can live mentally healthy and prosperous lives. We can prevent poor mental health if people are supported to live well. Removing the stress of meeting our basic needs of food, shelter, and warmth is where we start – unbelievably, this is what we’re still asking for in 2022! In the meantime, there are some things we can do to help recognise and cope with stress. If you are feeling stressed, you may feelanxious, afraid, angry, aggressive, sad, irritable, frustrated, ordepressed. Physically this may cause headaches, nausea, indigestion, digestive problems such as constipation or bloating, shallow breathing or hyperventilating, excessive sweating, aches and pains, or heart palpitations. You may behave differently when feeling stressed. You risk withdrawing from your family or friends, being indecisive or inflexible, being tearful, havingtrouble sleeping, experiencing sexual problems, or taking up harmful behaviour more often, such assmoking,drinking alcohol, ortaking drugs. To help manage stress, it’s important to talk with people you trust. People with strong social networks cope better. If you don’t feel you can confide in someone you know, you can use a confidential helpline such as Breathing Space or Samaritans (see below). Have a look at our blog on the cost-of-living crisis, which has things that you can try to help. If stress is becoming overwhelming, try getting some professional help from your GP. If the financial strain is causing stress, some organisations may be able to offer practical help, such as StepChange or Turn 2 Us (see below). Stress is a common experience, but that doesn’t mean we have to put up with it. Support is available to help manage stress before it becomes a problem.

There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. This blog was written by Hugh Mayers, aBecoming a Man (BAM)Counsellor. In recent years, there has been a growing conversation about mental health in the mainstream media. And in part, you could put that down to the power of celebrity. One effect of this seems to be that it gave us all permission to look at ourselves and acknowledge that “it’s okay not to be okay.” This might not seem such a revelation for girls and women. After all, it’s clear from watching children play and interact that girls are socialised to talk about how they feel and what’s going on for them. However, in contrast, boys have always been less inclined to communicate how they feel. It’s just that it might take more of a keen eye as opposed to a keen ear. Boys and men in our society are just now creating spaces where they feel comfortable talking about “what’s the deal”. So, celebrities coming out to share their vulnerabilities has been a game changer. More men and boys have now started to talk about what they really feel about themselves and society in general and talking about what they think and feel about their future life challenges or events that have taken place in the past. Nonetheless, there is a history behind why boys were socialised to be tough and bottle-up emotions, and we need to appreciate that before just labelling it as negative. In the pre-industrialised world, particularly in Northern Europe, life was tough for both men and women. Most people lived on what we would rightly consider well below the poverty line and cold weather, wild animals and food shortages bred a particular form of masculinity. Being the physically stronger of the two, men found themselves in a leadership role. Yes, there was power and responsibility, but the environment didn’t really lend itself to men who couldn’t exert a certain level of self-control. Since those days, we have gained more control over our environment and with the advances in science, we have created an industrialised, automated world. So, the necessity for super tough, emotionally repressed men is outdated. The good news is that boys and men can get in touch with their feelings and learn more about how to connect with and heal their inner being. However, the not-so-good news is that it has to be on men’s terms. What we don’t want is a performative, new-age masculinity modelled after some female archetype. Some boys and men will still prefer to watch or participate in sports like boxing or rugby and reside in what we could call ‘a masculine frame’ and still be able to understand how they feel and express that where they feel safe. Mental health across society is more and more destigmatised, and that’s a good thing. As a society, we create more safe spaces for boys and men, who find it appealing or relevant, so it may help that pressure cooker effect that sometimes takes place when young men who have been holding in a range of suppressed feelings blow a fuse and explode inwardly andself-harmor lash out at a person or property. Because essentially, that’s the elephant in the room. If boys and men don’t learn how to work through their more challenging emotions, then there is a risk that they will behave in ways that are potentially harmful to themselves as well as those around them. Working as a psychotherapist for over 14 years and also more recently with teenage boys as a counselling mentor, what has come to my attention is helping young men figure things out in terms of how they feel, why they feel that way and what type of man they want to become - it's not just that it’s an honour to be part of that process, but it’s sacred work. For aeons, this work was done by priests and a shaman. We just added a modern twist, where we talk about self-care and say, “Guys, think about your sleep patterns. When do you sleep, and for how long.” Good sleep helps with positive mental health. “Fellas, how are you eating? Regular meals with balanced nutrition or junk and sweets. And are you exercising? Alright, you don’t want to join the gym, but did you think about doing a free exercise video from YouTube or just going for a walk in the park?” You know nature makes us feel good. And research suggestsvigorous exercisethree times a week can significantly improve well-being. In fact, a recent study done by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that running for 15 minutes a day or walking for an hour reduces the risk of major depression by 26%. Now isn’t that something to think about?

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/what-well-being-how-can-we-measure-it-and-how-can-we-support-people-improve-it,"What is well-being, how can we measure it and how can we support people to improve it?","When considering mental health and well-being, Liz Felton, CEO of Together for Mental Wellbeing, thinks that health, physical activity and social interaction are vital. Well-being is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as “the state of being comfortable, healthy, or happy.” However, it is important to realise that well-being is a much broader concept than moment-to-moment happiness. While it does includes happiness, it also includes other things, such as how satisfied people are with their life a whole, their sense of purpose, and how in control they feel. In this respect, the New Economics Foundation describes well-being as the following: ‘Well-being can be understood as how people feel and how they function, both on a personal and a social level, and how they evaluate their lives as a whole.”[1] Most people would agree that well-being is something they strive towards and the subjective measure of people’s well-being is deemed so important that it is included alongside health and the economy inmeasures of national well-being. But once we look beyond the definition it is difficult to drill down into what well-being really means to people day to day, the factors that may influence it (both internal and external), how we can best measure it and how we can support people to improve it. Yet that doesn’t mean we should shy away from it either. When supporting people with mental health issues, by focusing on well-being we avoid relying on more traditional measures of mental health such as symptoms of illness. Many people who use mental health services consider these to be outdated and not in line with how they view their own well-being. In addition, they don’t take into account all of the factors that may affect someone’s health or happiness of which symptoms of illness could be just one. We must also consider how external conditions (such as income, housing and social networks) and a person’s internal resources (such as optimism, resilience and self-esteem) can affect their well-being. In this respect, how we go about measuring well-being is as challenging as it is worthwhile. Measuring well-being can be done in a number of ways – there is no ‘one size fits all’ approach. However, one useful way of measuring well-being is the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS). This is a scale of 14 positively worded items, designed to measure both the feelings and functioning aspects of positive mental well-being. For example, the scale includes items such as ‘I’ve been feeling optimistic about the future’, ‘I’ve been thinking clearly’ and ‘I’ve been interested in new things’. Participants are asked to choose the answer that best describes their experience of each item over the last two weeks, using a five point scale. The end result is a score between 14 and 70, with a higher score indicating better well-being. Whilst this is a robust and commonly used measure that can be used to show improvements in well-being over time both at the individual level, but also in making meaningful comparisons against national averages, it’s important to also look beyond the numbers and actually ask people how they are feeling. Furthermore, it's important that people's view of their own well-being is balanced with indicators relating to quality of life such as health, physical activity and social interaction. Having this information enables you to get the broadest possible perspective on someone's overall well-being and how well they manage day-to-day. As a provider of mental health services we think it’s crucial to measure the well-being of those that use our services and ensure we are working alongside people to improve this. Measuring well-being helps us to evaluate the impact of our services on people’s lives, but also which aspects of their lives people feel most dissatisfied with – which can help us to tailor our services to meet their needs. To us, this means looking at how people are 'in themselves', how well they feel they are coping with everyday life and how hopeful and confident they are about achieving their personal goals. The Mental Health Foundation recently completed a three year evaluation of our community mental health support services known asYour Way. One of the outcomes measured by the researchers to assess the impact of Your Way support was people's well-being. This included measures such as the WEMWBS scale, in-depth interviews and lifestyle indicators. We found that for people who took part in the evaluation within a month of first using Your Way their mental well-being (as measured by WEMWBS) had improved within three months. In addition, other lifestyle indicators measured as part of the evaluation showed that there were significant improvements in relation to the following areas: These findings are positive and encouraging. But we won’t stop there. We want to support as many people as possible to lead the life they want to lead. We understand thatworking with people with mental health problems is not like fixing a broken leg– we can’t just treat the immediate symptoms and expect that person to make a full recovery. Instead, we must see the whole person and all the factors that may affect their well-being. Only by doing so can we fully support individuals to lead independent, fulfilling lives in their communities. 11th Sep 2025

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/toxic-shadow-emotional-abuse,The toxic shadow of emotional abuse,"This content mentions abuse or violence, which some people may find triggering. Our guest blogger shares her story of experiencing covert emotional abuse, its power and control, and the damaging impact that had on her mental health. To me, kind and lasting love feels like aJack Johnson set; with everything merging into a calm and gentle background melody. Toxic love feels like living at aSlipknot concert(nothing against Slipknot) with booming noisy chaos and masks that blind you from the reality of the relationship. I have experienced covert emotional abuse: its power and control, and the damaging impact that had on my mental health. I want to share my story to raise awareness of the serious nature of this type of abuse and the impact it has on mental health, and to help other victims feel like they are not alone. It all started with love bombing, mirroring and flattery, leaving no space for me to see chaos and red flags. The relationship was possessive and obsessive, filled with poetic language, movie-esque intoxicating love and grand gestures. It was intense and short-lived. It involved subtle shifts through inconsistent communication, the giving and taking away of their availability and affection. Danger was implicit and always there. I was to be made aware of a sense of fragility in the relationship, the growing cracks that I needed to tread delicately on due to the risk of it ending if I didn't stay in line. Everything started to reverse, at a fast pace. The unpicking of the love and flattery they gave at the beginning was deeply unsettling and confusing, and took with it my self-esteem… at this point, I was weak and so under their control that I was living off the illusion that was created at the start. It was a black hole that sucked me in, soaked up my goodness and spat me out when there was no longer any use in me. It felt dark, toxic and damaging – because it was. At the end I was vulnerable and my mental health had spiralled. My family and friends were left confused as to where the bubbly and happy person they knew had gone, and how this had happened in such a short amount of time. This is because I'd just had one of the most confusing experiences involving emotional manipulation, gaslighting and abuse such as: Katie Ghose, Chief Executive of Women’s Aid: “Does he manipulate you by making you feel sorry for him? Does he blame you for everything that goes wrong? These behaviours can slowly erode your confidence and independence, and have a devastating impact on your mental health. They are possessive, controlling and ultimately abusive. “These are some of the signs of emotional abuse that form part of a repeated pattern of coercive and controlling behaviour. This sometimes subtle form of abuse was made illegal two years ago, yet much more awareness needs to be raised to make sure that everyone understands it and can recognise it. Lack of understanding is one reason why women and their family and friends don’t always recognise abuse straight away, or realise what is happening until it has got extremely serious. It can have a devastating impact on women, including causing or exacerbating mental health issues. We know from our work with survivors that nearly a quarter of women accessing community-based support services had mental health support needs, while this increases to nearly a third of women who are living in refuge (Women’s Aid 2016 Annual Survey). “This simply has to change. Coercive control is at the heart of abusive relationships, and that’s why at Women’s Aid we work hard to raise awareness of all forms of abuse and offer expert support to those who are experiencing it and their friends and family."" If you are worried that your relationship, or that of a friend or family member, is controlling or unsafe, visitWomen's Aidor call the Freephone 24/7 National Domestic Violence Helpline, run by Women’s Aid in partnership with Refuge, on0808 2000 247.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/why-relationships-are-so-important-children-and-young-people,Why relationships are so important for children and young people,"By Paula Lavis, Co-ordinator of the Children and Young People's Mental Health Coalition As social beings, the capacity to form and maintain relationships is essential to us and how we function within society. It is a key component to being mentally healthy, and having a positive sense of wellbeing. This is true for children and young people of all ages, from the very early years through to the teenage years. The first two years of a baby’s life are crucial to their development and future mental health and wellbeing. The brain is developing and it is at its most adaptable during these early years of life. So how we interact with the child can be critical for their healthy development. Parents and carers will have a relationship with their child, but it is the quality of the relationship that is important. A consistent and sensitive relationship is needed, to ensure that babies form a secure attachment or bond with their parents. There islots written about attachment theory elsewhere, but the gist of it from a psychological perspective is that it is about how babies use their relationships with their main carer to set-up an expectation about themselves and their relationships with others. A securely attached child will learn that their parents/carer will comfort them when they are distressed, and they will develop a sense that they are worthy of being consoled and loved. This is essential for healthy development in the child, and will set them up for a good start in life. Children who are securely attached are better able to manage their own feelings and behaviours and better able to relate to others. This gets babies off to a good start in terms of their social development as well. As children grow up, their ability to form and sustain relationships – be that with peers, parents, teachers etc. is crucial. Most children will naturally acquire these skills as they develop. However, there are some children who, for various reasons need some help with this. There are various social and emotional learning programmes that work in or with schools, and can help with various things including how people get on with each other. There is some evidence to indicate that these programmes are very helpful both in terms of social and emotional learning,but they also can improve attainment as well. The important thing to emphasis here is that whilst these programmes are evidence based, they need to be implemented properly to achieve these positive results. The Children and Young People’s Mental Health Coalition advocates that these programmes promoting social and emotional learning are set within awhole-school approachto promoting mental health and wellbeing. Our relationships aren’t confined to humans. This is probably not for everyone, but we can have very positive relationships with our pets. These relationships can have a positive impact on both our physical and mental health. For instance, they canhelp reduce stressandbring down blood pressure. Perhaps the strangest, is that dogs have been shown to help children who havedifficulties with their reading. There are a few schools in the country that have ‘employed’ specially trained dogs to help children with their reading. It seems that part of the appeal, as long as you like dogs, is that they are non-judgemental, aren’t critical and just cute. This encourages the child to want to be with the dog and read to it. We know that there are some children who may have particular problems forming relationships. This may include children with a learning disability, autism spectrum disorders and so on. Whilst they have particular needs, it doesn’t mean that they can’t form relationships. But people around them need to give more consideration to how they can help them build relationships. Building a ‘Circle of Friends’ around the person can be very helpful – and can be used with adults as well as children. Often people don’t know how to engage with someone with a learning disability. So Circles of Friends is a useful tool to help create this support network around the person. This is enormously important regarding their mental health as about 36% of children with a learning disability live with a mental health problem. Children’s relationships with their parents, siblings and wider family, and then of course their peers and other adults such as teachers are incredibly important. Whilst they can have a very positive impact on our mental health and wellbeing, when they aren’t good they can have a very negative impact on us. For instance poor relationships both within families and peers are acommon trigger for self-harming behaviours. We know that other issues such as bullying, or relationships difficulties between parentscan have an extremely negative impact on the child’s mental health. Relationships within families can become difficult when the child (or adult for that matter) is ill. A stressful thing for any family is when their child is seriously ill, and this is possibly even worse when a child has mental health problems. Your child being seriously ill is bad enough, but the sad reality for many children and young people with serious mental health problems is that when they need to be admitted to hospital,they often have to travel miles, sometimes across the other side of the country, to find a bed. Being in hospital as a child is awful, but if you are miles away from your family, which many are, it can be horrendous. While young people will no doubt form relationships with their peers on the wards, and hopefully with practitioners as well; it is a time when they need those strong and secure relationships that families and good friends can provide. If your child is miles away, it is very difficult to provide this support on a day-to-day basis. If you as a parent are stressed, this will impact on the rest of the family and your relationship with them. Relationships are important on so many levels, and across the life course. But, if we can make sure that babies, children and young people are able to form and maintain positive relationships in ways that make sense to them, then this will help get them off to a good start in life and support their mental development. This is important for children and young people themselves, but also their families, friends and the communities they live in. In this campaign we talked about healthy relationships; what's important, how to recognise, build and maintain healthy relationships, and how relationships can affect our mental health and wellbeing.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/racism-and-mental-health,Racism and mental health,"This content mentions suicide or suicidal thoughts, discrimination or discriminatory violence (such as homophobia, racism, sexism and ableism), substance abuse and addiction (which may include mentions of alcohol or drug use), trauma, depression and anxiety. Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. Racism means using the concept of race to judge or treat some people worse than others. It exists in many forms, and on many levels in society – including in healthcare. It can include acts of discrimination and prejudice towards individuals and groups. It can also describe wider systems of oppression.Racism is a mental health issue because racism causes trauma. Andtraumacan contribute to the development and worsening of ill mental health. At the Mental Health Foundation, we seek to shed light on a range of issues thatprevent good mental health– andracism is certainly at the top of that list. We have been working hard over the last two years toput anti-racist practice at the centre of our workand we’ll be sharing more on that front later this year. For now, I wanted to create a space for some of the incredible staff members and community partners of the Foundation with lived experience of the harmful impacts of both interpersonal and structural racism.Below, they offer their perspectives and expertise and share the resources they rely on to better understand, cope and take action against various forms of racist oppression they have encountered. I stand humbled by their resilience and commitment to working for the health and well-being of everyone around them. I hope others reading this post are moved to action in the same way we have been moved as an organisation and staff community. And finally, before I turn it over to the experts,a deep debt of gratitude to each of my colleagues listed below for your thoughtful leadership on a topic that is often painful to discuss.I hope that one day soon, the burden of these conversations will stop being placed on your shoulders. I look forward to your continued partnership. The things in society which have an impact on mental health are made worse and intensified by racism for racialised communities – people who are classified by race because of the white-led systems they exist within. This affects our day-to-day quality of life. We believe that racism is created and reproduced by the same socioeconomic systems that mediate the social determinants (i.e. the circumstances in which people live and work) that shape their overall health outcomes, and no conversation about racism is complete without a thorough discussion of these links.  For example, social determinants such as adverse early life experiences or unemployment are believed to drive many deep-rooted health inequalities, such as lower life expectancy or put individuals at stronger risk of mental ill health. We know thatrace and power have long been intertwined– from slavery to the legacies of colonialism, to inequalities of access and opportunity entrenched in education and health, and everything in between. Acknowledging and exploring these issues (with questions such as whose behaviours and feelings are considered ‘normal’ and whose are treated as deviations or diseases?) is paramount to addressing some of the root causes that continue to plague minority communities in all kinds of cruel ways. We want to state up front that race is not something produced by the racialised. It can be understood as having arisen from material conditions that required the delineation and organisation of people into specific groups so they could be exploited and brutalised for profit. This is the process of racialisation and it does not serve the racialised, nor do racialised people reproduce it. It was born as a result of historical processes in service of the class of people who own property and sought to acquire or steal more resources, including human labour.Therefore, it is not the fault of the racialised that we experience racism.This is precisely why racialisation is a traumatic and dehumanising process – one that many racialised people have endeavoured to take an active part in navigating. Through active engagement with the experience of being racialised and out of necessity, racialised people often claim their racial designations and feel a sense of pride in them, which can serve as a protective factor for mental health (Woo, Fan, Tran, Takeuchi, 2019). Further, we recognise that talking about racism and the inequalities it creates as separate from discrimination and inequality stemming from gender, class, sexuality, ability, immigration status, age, etc. often misses the bigger picture. For certain groups of people (like Black migrant women), experiencing discrimination across a number of different axes leads to overlapping, concurrent forms of oppression. For more on this topic, we recommend this resource onwhy intersectionality is vital to anti-discriminatory practice. We also wanted to acknowledge a sad but important truth: we are tired of having this conversation.It is frustrating and disempowering knowing that recommendations from decades ago about systemic racism have still not been actioned.But we are also steadfast in our hope and belief that we’re turning a corner on these issues and will continue to do what is necessary to ensure good mental health for all, especially for our communities experiencing mistreatment, disrespect, the casual racist “joke”, microaggressions, and those encountering injustice through laws, policies, and practices designed to hold us down. All the various forms of racism and discrimination can lead to an erosion of self-confidence and lead to self-doubt, making us question our identity and our place in the world.The emotions brought on by these experiences can have negative effects on well-being: Over time,the dehumanising effects of discrimination and racism can lead to racial trauma,causing someone to revisit distressing events constantly in their head. If this is left untreated, it can affect your ability to function in life and work and maintain relationships with colleagues, friends, and family.Symptoms ofracial traumainclude: In addition to the significant impact of racism on mental health and well-being,racism also affects physical health. If you have or are experiencing racism, help is available. You are not alone. There are a number of excellent resources available already online (we have curated a short list below) and a number of organisations, likeBlack ThriveandColourful Minds, are working hard at addressing the root causes, multiple manifestations and severe consequences of racism in society.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/ceo-mark-rowland-reflects-findings-casey-report-and-its-implications-mental-health,CEO Mark Rowland reflects on the findings of the Casey report and its implications for mental health,"This content mentions discusses discrimination or discriminatory violence (such as homophobia, racism, sexism and ableism) and mentions sexual assault, abuse or violence, trauma, depression and anxiety, which some people may find triggering. Last week, I sat with a group of 12- and 13-year-old boys in a school in Streatham. They are part of ourBecoming a Man programmewhich supports young people in exploring issues around identity and belonging, and how to manage emotions like shame and anger. One of the most common issues they reported was the hostile environment created by the police for Black boys and young men. Their experiences in Streatham were reflected in what I later read inBaroness Casey’s independent reportof the Met Police’s culture and standards of behaviour. It exposed the scale of institutionalised discrimination in the Met Police and the scant progress made since the MacPherson report in 1999. Baroness Casey uncovered a complacency that serves as a warning to all leaders of organisations. One officer told her, ‘I think you might find pockets of misogyny in the organisation, but we’ve pretty much dealt with racism’. The report lays bare how far as a society we need to go. It vividly captures howdiscrimination can lead to disadvantage which can in turn damage life chances. There is much more we must do to ensure safety, dignity and equity for everyone, which is a fundamental requirement of a mentally healthy society. The report sets out a wealth of evidence thatBlack and ethnic minority communitiesare under-protected. Black people were nearly six times more likely to be murdered in London. Additionally, in the three years from 2020, Black people in London were nearly twice as likely to be a recorded rape victim than White people, 66% more likely to be a reportedvictim of domestic abuseand over 2.5 times more likely to be a victim of hate crime. Every year since 2016, those aged 11 to 61 who appear to be Black were at least 3.5 times more likely to be stopped and searched by the Met than their White counterparts. Black people in London were more likely to be handcuffed, have a baton used against them and more likely to have a Taser fired on them by a Met officer than White people. Black children were more likely to be treated as adults and as a threat. Black children have been subject to inappropriate and intrusive interventions by Met officers, including strip searches. The report also highlighted sexism as rife within the Met in terms of how female Met officers are treated by their colleagues, and how women in the public are treated. A third of Met women surveyed reported personally experiencing sexism at work, with 12% reporting directly experiencing sexual harassment or assault. Everyday experiences for women include patronising comments, downplaying of their achievements, overt inappropriate sexual comments, unwanted attention, harassment, violence and being spoken over. Trust has also fallen in theLGBTQ+ community, as recorded homophobic hate crimes in London have increased significantly. Over the past five years, this has gone up by 75% while investigations into high-profile murders revealed deep-rooted homophobia. It is now undeniable that being a victim of a hate crime has a detrimental effect on mental health. Research has suggested that when individuals are targeted because of who they are or how they appear, they are likely to experience a host of negative emotions, distinct from those who have experienced nonbiased criminal victimisation.1 Victims of hate crimes are more likely to suffer higher levels ofdepression, vulnerability,anxiety, nervousness, an extremesense of isolationandlong-lasting fear.2As individuals realise that they have been targeted for characteristics they cannot change, it is common for those who have experienced hate crimes to fear ‘repeat victimisation’.2This can lead to people altering the ways in which they lead their lives. People who belong to targeted communities may modify their behaviour in terms of how they dress and where they go, avoiding certain areas and services as they can be fearful of another attack.3 We know that over-policing in racialised communities can have a detrimental impact on mental health. The review itself found that people stopped by the police suffered more mental health problems than those who live in the same neighbourhoods but have not been stopped by police. People who participated in this review described being stopped and searched as humiliating andtraumatic. Wider research outside of this report has found that fear of the police can elevate distress at a population level: hearing stories of police brutality that apply to one’s population group can foster worry about becoming a victim.4 Bullying,stigmaand isolation because of race, gender, religion, sexuality and disability is like poison for our mental health. We know from our own work that atoxic work environmentand feelings of stigma can be corrosive to our mental health.5It is why workplace interventions on mental health are so vital and why we are calling for trauma-informed training to be a standard for all public servants.6-7 The Casey report is a reminder of why the mission to create a mentally healthy society cannot be realised unless we tackle discrimination, bullying and abuse.For the sake of the boys that I sat with in Streatham last week, let’s re-double our efforts towards that goal.

Last summer, we collaborated with Merthyr Tydfil College and artist Bill Taylor-Beales to help students and staff express emotions creatively, in a safe and supportive environment through the Art + Soul project. Participants of the project included members of the college’s student well-being support team and some of the students that they work with, who have lived experiences of poor mental health andautism, in a town that has considerablesocio-economic inequalities. Over the course of eight sessions in four weeks, participants were provided with arts materials and shown how to create with a variety of techniques including sketching, printmaking, portraiture, stop motion animation and clay work. The arts can be good for our mental health because they provide people with the opportunity to explore their feelings and emotions creatively. Art can also enable people to have conversations about mental health in a way that other experiences and activities can’t. Artistic projects can provide opportunities for people to socialise, helping them to overcome isolation andloneliness. The group bonded quickly, especially as they were able to hold the sessions in person, and experienced multiple benefits. ""I enjoyed exploring how to draw and express emotions to show how we are feeling. If I was not doing this, I wouldn’t have got out of bed."" - Chase, student ""It taught me not to go hard on myself – not to stress out. I struggle withdepression, so being able to show people how it feels through the artwork was really helpful."" - Nikola, student ""I am more myself when I am doing something creative and engaging with someone. Being in the sessions made me feel better and put me in a better mood."" - Cori, student ""It was very cool to look at emotions this way. We are all learning and growing and not fully understanding ourselves. Knowing our emotions and others help us manage them. This is very useful for young people – especially our age."" - Chaos, student Rosy Lewis, Mental Health Officer at Merthyr Tydfil College, said: ""During the sessions, we explored lots of questions that we could not do in other situations… and it helped us to form better relationships with the students. Expressing yourself through art does not have to be complicated, you do not need any artistic competence to be able to engage in the session and explore your emotional expression through art practice. It’s about looking after your own mental health but doing it together."" For more details on this project, please contact Rosy Lewis at Merthyr Tydfil College.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/why-anxiety-theme-mental-health-awareness-week-2023,Why anxiety is the theme for Mental Health Awareness Week 2023,"This content mentions anxiety, which some people may find triggering. I was thrilled to join the Mental Health Foundation earlier this year, having worked in health policy all my life. Many of us have struggled with our mental health in recent years, and it feels like there’s never been a more important time to support and protect our mental well-being. The Mental Health Foundation’s approach – preventing mental health problems before they happen and supporting everyone to thrive – really resonates with me. And the icing on the cake is being part ofMental Health Awareness Week! I have joined in with Mental Health Awareness Week for many years and am delighted to now be part of making it happen. This year for Mental Health Awareness Week we are focusing on anxiety. We all feel anxious from time to time. Anxiety is a natural response to the uncertain world around us. For example, in the currentcost-of-living crisis, more than a third ofadults feel anxious about their financial situation. But it’s important that we recognise and respond when we feel anxious, so that our anxiety doesn’t become overwhelming. Anxietycan affect us physically and mentally. If you are feeling anxious, you might notice your heart rate increasing, headaches, loss of appetite, breathlessness or chest pain. (If you are experiencing these symptoms, you should see a healthcare professional to rule out another physical cause). Anxiety might make you feel tense or nervous, find it hard to relax, feel tearful or have problems sleeping and concentrating. Friends or family might notice you are more irritable than usual, or more withdrawn. Or perhaps you seem fine on the outside but feel panicky inside. Help is at hand. There are things that we can all do to protect our mental health and manage anxiety. What works will be different from person to person. Things that might be helpful include being active, getting out in nature, practising breathing techniques, getting support to tackle money worries or eating well. Talking to a friend, or spending time with loved ones, is often a good first step. We’ve looked at the evidence for what works to manage anxiety and brought together ourtop recommendations. Taking action to address specific causes of anxiety can also help – for example, contacting a money advisor, discussing workplace stress with your employer, or seeking support if you are experiencing bullying, harassment or discrimination. If anxiety is severely affecting your everyday life, you shouldcontact your GPwho can offer additional support and help. No one should struggle alone. Anxiety isn’t just something we can overcome on our own. So much of what may trigger anxiety is not within our control. This is why,during Mental Health Awareness Week, we’ll also be talking to politicians and decision-makers about what can be done as a nation to support good mental health. While causes of anxiety are complex, financial worries, social isolation, social pressures and discrimination can all play a part. And because of this, local and national politicians should be looking at measures such as income support to reduce financial stress, provision of good quality housing, strong legislation to prevent bullying, harassment and discrimination, and ensuring communities are equipped with the services and facilities we need to live well and help protect everyone’s mental health.

This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week focuses on anxiety, which will increase people's awareness and understanding of anxiety by providing information on what can help prevent it from becoming a problem. HLCs will host over 30 events during the week, themed around what can help people protect their mental health. Sessions including Chi Me, colour breathing, mindful walks, music therapy and cold water swimming will be hosted at various centres across Northern Ireland. In addition, events will bring together community and statutory organisations that can provide support on issues such as money issues, healthy eating, spending time in nature and getting moving.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/reflecting-mental-health-awareness-week-2023-northern-ireland,Reflecting on Mental Health Awareness Week 2023 in Northern Ireland,"Location:Northern Ireland During May we celebratedMental Health Awareness Weekin Northern Ireland with a wealth of community events. Partnering with the Healthy Living Centre Alliance under our Covid Response Programme on theMental Health for Better Daysproject, Healthy Living Centres organised a remarkable 41 events. They had everything from calming Tai Chi sessions to staff wellbeing days, nature walks, community lunches, and chilly sea dips. It was a week buzzing with activities, demonstrating the unique role community organisations play in bringing people together. During the week, I had the privilege to encounter extraordinary individuals, each with their unique journeys. Many had their lives disrupted by sudden health diagnoses, which led to changes in their jobs, social networks, and daily routines. They found themselves grappling not only with their new health conditions but also with the impact of increasing isolation on their mental health. So often, the turning point was a referral to the Better Days pain support programme. Hosted at their local community centres, this programme offered a sense of familiarity. Despite initial hesitations, reassuring calls from the facilitators eased them into attending their first session. This programme became more than just a coping mechanism for their health conditions; it served as their bridge back to the community. They often joined others, such as the walking groups or Tai Chi classes. Even when health issues made the physical side of these classes challenging, the tea, biscuits, and heartfelt conversations ensured their continued participation. These groups provided them with a renewed sense of community, a new social circle, and a supportive network crucial in protecting their mental health. These personal journeys were echoed to me throughout the week, emphasising the pivotal role that community plays in mental health prevention. Each event showcased the power of community activity and the sense of belonging it nurtures, creating a space where the business of prevention happens. The week highlights the necessity for sustainable and responsive funding for community organisations. These unsung heroes, often volunteers working with limited budgets, play a vital role in supporting people navigate life's complexities and protect their mental health. As we look back onMental Health Awareness Week, it is a stark reminder of the power and strength present in our communities. By ensuring these community groups have the resources they need, we can cultivate environments where individuals feel safe to express their struggles and seek support. As we plan our next steps, let's remember the lessons from this week. Let's harness the power of our communities and continue to reshape our mental health narrative, creating a society where everyone feels seen, heard, and valued.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/latest-figures-show-those-most-impacted-cost-living-crisis-experience-most-mental-distress,Latest figures show those most impacted by cost-of-living crisis experience the most mental distress,"Location:Scotland Financial strain and poverty are key drivers of poor mental health. People struggling to pay their rent or mortgage, feed their families, or cover essential bills are at higher risk of developing mental health problems includinganxietyanddepression. Last summer as thecost-of-living crisisbegan to take hold, we were, of course, very concerned about the potential negative impacts on people’s mental health. Public mental health was already severely bruised due to the pandemic, with people who were already disadvantaged by inequalities bearing the brunt. With no respite, the cost-of-living crisis hit and exacerbated the pressures already faced by so many people. As the months went by, here, in one of the richest countries in the world, we heard about increasing numbers of people skipping meals and foregoing heating their homes because they couldn’t afford it. Unsurprisingly, by November, people were showing signs of mental distress. In Scotland, our survey of more than 1,000 adults carried out by Opinium found that 33 per cent of adults experienced stress, 40 per cent experienced anxiety, and 13 per cent said they felt hopeless due to their financial situation in the previous month. These results were further affirmed by polling carried out for the Foundation in March of this year, showing that among those who had been feeling anxious in the previous two weeks, worry about paying household bills was the most common reason. Recent statisticspublished by the Scottish Governmentunderscore our concerns. As of March, almost half (49%) of Scottish adults reported that their mental health is being negatively impacted by the cost-of-living situation, and 13 per cent said that their mental health is being negatively impacted to a large extent. As ever, it is people who have the least that are shouldering the greatest burden. People who report that they are managing their household finances less well are ten times more likely to report a negative impact on their mental health to a large extent. Of those who say they are managing their household finances well, only 3 per cent report a negative impact on their mental health to a large extent. On the other hand, almost a third (31%) of people who say they are managing their household finances less well say the cost-of-living crisis is negatively impacting their mental health to a large extent. This huge gap in mental distress between those who are managing their finances well and those managing less well reflects what we know aboutfinancial stress– that it’s bad for people’s mental health. There are things we can do as individuals to help us maintain good mental health but, worryingly, the increased cost-of-living is causing people to reduce these healthy behaviours. Our polling in November 2022 found that people wereexercisingless, getting poorersleep, and not spending as much time with friends and family. Scottish Government data confirms that people are reducing social contact. In March 43 per cent of Scottish adults reported that the cost-of-living situation has impacted negatively on spending time with or connecting with others, and this has risen from 39 per cent in September 2022. This is concerning because connecting with others is a well-evidenced protective factor for mental health. Again, there are large differences between those who are managing well financially and those who are not: These figures show that efforts by UK and Scottish Government to support people who are struggling financially, such as energy support schemes, expanding free school meals and doubling child payment, do not go far enough to address the inequalities that put people at higher risk of poor mental health. The differences in the extent of negative effect on mental health between people who are financially comfortable and those who are struggling highlight the urgent need for additional targeted measures that ensure people in greatest need of support, whose mental health is most at risk, will benefit. These figures show that efforts by UK and Scottish Government to support people who are struggling financially, such as energy support schemes, expanding free school meals and doubling child payment, do not go far enough to address the inequalities that put people at higher risk of poor mental health. The differences in the extent of negative effect on mental health between people who are financially comfortable and those who are struggling highlight the urgent need for additional targeted measures that ensure people in greatest need of support, whose mental health is most at risk, will benefit. To truly address the disparity in mental health between rich and poor, governments mustdo their part in ensuring that everyone has enough income to prevent financial stress. The Scottish Government should advocate to the UK Government for an increase to Universal Credit so that it meets people’s essential needs, as recommended by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the Trussell Trust. In the meantime, one step that would support young parents would be a Scottish Child Payment top-up. The Mental Health Foundation also supports the campaign for a Young Parent Top-up to SCP, which is being led byOne Parent Families Scotland. Additionally, the Scottish Government can take other measures to protect people’s mental health during this cost-of-living crisis by: Workers in the frontline public sector and customer service roles must provide a supportive experience for people that does not stigmatise or cause distress. This can be done by building the capacity of frontline workers in various community and service settings to respond to mental distress and signpost support sensitively. This includes call-centre staff, who are often the first point of contact with people in distress. You can take action to prevent mental health problems today.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/negative-mental-health-effects-rising-cost-living-should-spur-government-action,Negative mental health effects of rising cost-of-living should spur Government action,"By Michael Hough, Policy Officer at Mental Health Foundation, and Rachelle Earwaker, Senior Economist at Joseph Rowntree Foundation As we move into the summer months and parliamentary recess, the ongoingcost-of-livingcrisis shows no signs of receding. This persistent financial reality is detrimentally impacting the mental health of the nation. Over the last few months, at both the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the Mental Health Foundation, we have been further exploring the impact of this cost-of-living crisis on mental health. We know that mental health is shaped by the wide-ranging characteristics of the environments in which we live and that mental health problems are not evenly distributed across the whole population. There are certain risk factors that can make a person more vulnerable to mental ill health. Financial strain is one of these risk factors. It increases the risk of mental health problems and can be a causal factor and consequence of mental ill health. In particular, it heightens the risk of an individual experiencinganxietyordepression. Any focus on reducing financial strain is therefore a focus on improving mental health. Financial support schemes that can alleviate financial stress for people experiencing poverty are vital. That’s why we’ve been proud to work together, along with our colleagues at the Trussell Trust, on the Essentials Guarantee campaign. This calls for the UK Government to make sure that the basic rate of Universal Credit is at least enough to afford essentials, such as food, household bills and travel costs, and that support can never be pulled below that level. Recent polling, commissioned by the Mental Health Foundation forMental Health Awareness Week, revealed the most common self-reported cause of anxiety for people across the UK was being able to afford to pay bills. 32% of UK adults said being unable to pay their bills had made them feel anxious in the past two weeks.1Those aged 35-64 years old were found to be most anxious about their finances. In the same poll, 20% of UK adults said debt had made them feel anxious in the last two weeks.2 These worrying trends are also evident in the Joseph Rowntree Foundation’s latest cost of living tracker from May 2023.3The tracker, which assesses how households in the bottom 40% of incomes are faring during the cost of living crisis, showed that over half of those households (51%) with a member who had a mental health condition reported going without three or more essentials in the last six months.4This was more than double the rate of those households without a member with a mental health condition (22%). The research also underlined that 82% of low-income households containing a person with a mental health condition reported going without essentials. This is significantly more than the average of 63% for all low-income households. The tracker shows evidence of links between those in financial strain and going without essentials and poor mental health:4.1 million low-income households (35%) reported having a person struggling with poor mental health in the last two years. Of this group of households, 40% said their mental health had deteriorated during the last two years, 21% said their mental health had stayed the same, 13% said their mental health had improved, and 26% said their poor mental health had started within the last two years. The tracker also shows how the mental health of people on low incomes is being affected by their financial circumstances. Among low-income households who said they were going without at least one essential, nearly half (47%) reported at least one household member experiencing poor mental health in the last two years, compared to 14% of households not going without essentials. These statistics corroborate what we feared would happen, that the cost of living crisis would put millions of people’s mental health at risk. While the small steps that have been taken such as the introduction of the cost of living grant are welcome, governments across the UK must still do more to help people experiencing problems with their mental health due to the current financial situation. Targeted action is imperative for those high risk-groups that are more likely to be disproportionately affected by the cost of living crisis. Some of these high-risk groups include people on benefits or low incomes, asylum-seekers, refugees, people from Black and minority ethnic communities, lone parents, older people, students and people with disabilities. Alongside the implementation of the Essentials Guarantee, we are also calling for greater support to be given to community groups through access to additional funding. This means looking at the positive assets present in communities and supporting them through additional funding to carry out their vital work supporting social connection and good mental health. This should be accompanied by the implementation of a mental health and well-being policy assessment tool which would assess the mental health impacts of all government decisions. We are also calling for leadership to be shown at the highest levels of essential service companies and creditors and throughout management so that frontline workers know how to respond effectively to the mental health effects of financial stress and strain. This could involve building the capacity of frontline workers in various community and service settings and training them to respond to mental distress and signpost support sensitively. Workers in the frontline public sector and customer service roles must provide a supportive experience for people that does not stigmatise or cause distress. Public mental health, namely the improvement of mental health and wellbeing through preventative work involving communities, organisations and individuals, must be considered a priority in all government policy. The approach outlined above would mitigate the worst impacts of the financial crisis on the UK’s mental health. Governments across the UK should implement it urgently. 7th May 2025

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/reflections-conservative-and-labour-party-conferences,Reflections on the Conservative and Labour party conferences,"Mental Health Foundation’s Director of England, Alexa Knight, reflects on the 2023 Conservative and Labour party conferences and the implications for public mental health. At the Mental Health Foundation, we work with politicians from across the political sphere to make the case for better public mental health. We've just been at the Conservative and Labour annual party conferences, where we met with local and national elected representatives, delegates, third sector partners and others. We ran our own events, opening up spaces to allow people to talk about mental health in relation to their experiences of financial pressures, Black motherhood and racism, and seeking asylum. Hearing these powerful testimonies led to a rich and fruitful discussion with policy makers and partners. But the conferences are also about hearing from politicians as they set out their policies, and to take in the mood music around the hall. Here are our takeaways from this year: Perhaps most distressing was some of the rhetoric used by politicians, particularly around migration and gender. These are complex issues, and parties and individuals will hold strong views. But using language that demonises anyone, particularly groups that are already vulnerable to poor mental health, is never acceptable. When it comes from our political leaders, it is reckless. The quality of public discourse affects people’s mental health because we all need to feel safe in order to thrive. It’s likely that we will have a general election in the next year. As the political world moves into campaigning mode, we will continue to argue for a holistic, cross-government approach that puts prevention of mental illness and the creation of mentally healthy communities at its heart. And we’ll strive for more support for those most at risk, to work towards our vision of good mental health for all – not just for some. Our policy and advocacy work calls on national and local governments to reduce the factors known to pose a risk to people’s mental health, enhance those known to protect it and create the conditions needed for people to thrive.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/my-first-year-member-diverse-experience-advisory-panel-deap,My first year as a member of the Diverse Experience Advisory Panel (DEAP),"Location:Scotland Carola joined the ScottishDiverse Experience Advisory Panel (DEAP)organised by the Mental Health Foundation in 2022, driven by her passion to fight stigma and discrimination towards people with disabilities. In this blog, Carola shares her experiences of her first year as a member of the DEAP. I have a physical disability rather than a mental one, but also a keen interest in all types of disability and 'otherness' that might limit or prevent full participation in society. I responded to the call by Mental Health Foundation (Scotland) for members of the new Diverse Experiences Advisory Panel (DEAP) without any serious expectations of being accepted. I’ve experienced discrimination, bias, stigma and bullying at school, in the workplace, by friends, family and society in general. I can therefore understand and appreciate the challenges and hurt that those with mental health issues face on a daily basis. Knowing that such behaviours often stem from ignorance rather than intended cruelty, of course, does nothing to lessen their impact. Even being selected for an interview surprised me. I met online with two staff members (Mairi Gordon, Senior Participation Officer, and Shari McDaid, Head of Evidence and Impact). The experience was efficient yet friendly and, to my relief, without the awful 'trick' and 'scenario' questions often encountered in interviews. Mairi and Shari seemed genuinely interested to know what I thought I could bring to the Panel. Despite the feeling that things had gone well, I still didn't think I would be selected.  When I heard back a couple of weeks later, I was amazed and thrilled to learn that I was one of about 30 applicants to be chosen. Looking back over DEAP's first year of existence, during which six main meetings (as well as a number of other voluntary ones) were held, what have I been able to contribute? Sadly, probably not as much as I'd hoped - at least that is my own impression. But I have learned an awful lot and it's been eye-opening to be involved in something so worthwhile and completely different from anything I have done before. It seems to me that I have helped more through feedback and editing of documents that explain how DEAP works, rather than through my opinions or ideas on how to improve mental health services. We all have different strengths (and weaknesses) and I do know that mine lean more towards the written, editorial and the administrative than to the spoken. I need time and mental space to reflect, and written work helps me do that. If I can, I leave the speeches and presenting to others who are better at it than I am. I'm sure Mairi, Ines Marcos (Project Officer) and their colleagues will have worked that out for themselves before reading it here. Before joining DEAP I didn't realise how difficult people find accessing some of the services, particularly if they are in the middle of a crisis. I was dismayed to discover that the various mental health services available aren't more joined up. In the age of computers and the internet, when other medical records are available to practitioners online, I was shocked to learn this isn't the case for mental health. I remember feeling aghast when one panel member explained that patients must repeat their experiences each time they see a different specialist. I can't imagine how frustrating that must be, just when you begin to think that someone might finally be able to give you the help you need. I would like to believe that in the time remaining for its current term, DEAP will be able to recommend to Scottish Government that services are streamlined more effectively, and the promotion of available services is extended and improved. I envision information (like easy-to-read pamphlets listing services and contact details) being readily available in many more public spaces than they are at present. These should include GP surgeries, libraries, community centres, church halls, schools, airports, and train and bus stations. I believe that having such information readily available in places where it can be picked up unnoticed will help normalise the fact that we all have mental health. It may also raise awareness that some people face more challenges than others. I hope that this visibility of information will also educate those who have not previously met anyone with mental health issues. I hope this, in turn, will help over time to end bias, stigma and discrimination against all who experience mental ill-health. Everyone is unique, special and has their own talents. This fact should be celebrated, not ridiculed or misrepresented by an ignorant minority. I realise the vision I have outlined here is a tall order, but I am willing to do all I can to help make it happen. I know I am only one small voice, an individual with physical limitations which make me housebound and prevent me from travelling, but I'd like to think there is something I can do to help bring about change. Anyone with more influence than I have reading this is more than welcome toget in touch. Carola Huttmann has been a member of theDiverse Experience Advisory Panel (DEAP)since its inception in March 2022. She holds an MLitt in Scottish Literature and, with almost forty years of working in office administration behind her, now practices as a writer and independent scholar. She is passionate about addressing stigma, discrimination and biases towards those with disabilities — both mental and physical — and finding ways of promoting public awareness and information in order to eradicate such prejudices. 7th May 2025

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/going-smokefree-why-new-age-sale-proposal-smoking-good-news-mental-health,Going smokefree; why the new age of sale proposal for smoking is good news for mental health,"Location:England In October 2023, the Government announced its proposal to increase the age of sale of tobacco in England. Mark Rowland, CEO of the Mental Health Foundation and Co-Chair of theMental Health and Smoking Partnership, shares why this is good news for mental health. For many years now, we have called for across-government approachto tackling the mental health crisis.  That’s because our mental health doesn’t operate in a vacuum. It’s affected by a whole range of social, environmental, physical, and economic factors. There are no silver bullets, no vaccine to protect against the risk of poor mental health. However, there is a lot we could and should be doing. We need bold new policy and community approaches that enable us to thrive and that reduce our risk of poor mental health. Smoking is still the largest cause of preventable death, and it remained in that position even during the pandemic. It is one of the most destructive yet changeable factors that influences our physical and mental health. In January 2023, we wrote with 25 other organisations to the Government. We urged them to publish a new tobacco plan with commitments to end smoking and build on the progress made in recent years that has halved smoking rates in the UK (from around 27% in 1990s to 12.9% in 2022[1]). So, when theGovernment announced its age of sale proposalin October 2023, it felt like a significant potential victory for public health. The Government’s plan would see the age of sale for tobacco increase by one year, every year. This would prevent anyone born on or after 1 January 2009 from legally buying cigarettes in England. It would be a world-leading approach that would reduce health inequalities and accelerate the progress already made in reducing smoking rates, the only legal product on the market which is likely to kill you if used in line with manufacturers’ instructions. For years, many people have believed a myth that smoking is a helpful way of reducing stress and anxiety.  For example, in evidence presented to the Mental Health and Smoking Partnership, the Smokefree Sheffield coalition reported that in Yorkshire, 43% of people still believed that smoking reduced stress. But we know the opposite is true. Although nicotine provides some short-term relief through the release of neurotransmitters like dopamine, this quickly gives way to much longer and increased withdrawal symptoms, including low mood, anxiety and depression. We now have clear evidence of the role of smoking in the onset and maintenance of poor mental health. Indirectly, through trapping smokers in a cycle of dependence that worsens physical and mental health (see fig 1). And directly, by increasing the risk of some mental health conditions (such asdepression and schizophrenia) and through the creation of addiction, which harms people’s mental wellbeing. It has also been shown that that quitting smoking improves your mental health, at least as much as some anti-depressants. And we also know the mental health benefits of stopping smoking increase as people abstain from smoking long-term. The physical impacts of smoking disproportionally affect people with poor mental health. It’s why smoking is the leading contributor to the 10-20 year gap in life expectancy between people with severe mental health conditions and the general population. In England, raising the age of sale from 16 to 18 in 2007 reduced smoking rates among 16- 17-year-olds by 30%[5]. In the US, when the age of sale was increased from 18 to 21, the chance of a person in that age group smokingfell by 39%.Government modelling estimatesthat raising the age of sale each year will mean up to1.7 million fewer people smoking by 2075. This would also avoid the mental and physical health consequences of up to 115,000 cases of stroke[6], heart disease, lung cancer and other lung diseases, saving tens of thousands of lives. And it will reduce some of the£21 billion that smoking coststhe public finances each year (almost double what is raised through taxation on cigarettes)[7]. In 2021, we produced ourbest mental health tips, backed by research. One of the most important tips was to avoid the use of recreational drugs and alcohol because of their damaging impact on our mental health. And this should include smoking. Any reduction in smoking rates will have a disproportionately positive impact on those with poor mental health. It will protect people with an existing diagnosis from the harms of smoking and prevent poor mental health in young people by reducing the number smoking in the first place. Reduced smoking rates will also benefit people with low income.  Smoking increases your risk of poverty and is also a major cause of health inequalities. For example, deaths attributable to smoking happen at a 2.1 times higher rate[8]in the most deprived local authoritiesthan in the least deprived[9]. We know that work to reduce poverty and inequalities are correlated to improved mental health outcomes. We need stop-smoking services in local authorities as well as within in-patient psychiatric settings to support those already addicted. And we also need to increase access to peer support groups for people wanting to stop smoking and to NHS Talking Therapies to enable them to get the support they need. But reducing the overall number of people smoking in the first place will allow the NHS to focus its resources on smoking cessation programs with the most vulnerable, including people with severe and enduring mental ill-health. The age of sale proposals are a once-in-a-generation public health opportunity to help create the conditions for better mental and physical health. We know that 67% of the public support these proposals[12]. But the tobacco industry is mobilising its vast resources to hold conferences, pay for adverts and lobby MPs to persuade us that restricting tobacco use will be an affront to individual liberty and damage the economy.  These myths have been systematically debunked byAction on Smoking and Health, but thecommercial determinants of healthare powerful forces. It’s why we continue to have a health system that treats the symptoms of ill-health while regulators fail to limit the promotion of products that cause many of the symptoms in the first place. Creating a mentally healthy society means taking bold steps to ensure that profit is not placed above the protection of good mental health.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/why-mental-health-awareness-matters,Why mental health awareness matters,"Location:England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland We have runMental Health Awareness Weeksince 2001. But recently questions have been raised about the value of mental health awareness. Have we gone too far in driving awareness of mental health and is it actually encouraging a ‘culture’ of poor mental health? Are the sceptics right? Is increased awareness doing more harm than good? Firstly, we should talk about what we mean by ‘awareness’. At the Mental Health Foundation, we define mental health awareness as increasing understanding of how to protect and support mental health and the range of issues affecting it, while reducing stigma and discrimination. We want people to understand how to manage difficult emotions in a healthy way, whether they are short-term responses to recent events, or a response to trauma in the past. But we also want to increase attention to the causes of mental ill-health and how to address them. Awareness efforts have played an important part in securing greater political attention on mental health and support for increased investment in recent years. Many people have been more open about their experiences, and many have told us this has been a profound journey. There is still much more to do, though.  Effective tools to live with good mental health or prevent issues developing into longer-term mental health problems are a skill we all need. Policy makers are only just recognising the range of wider action outside of the NHS needed to create the conditions for good mental health. Increased public interest and more open conversations about mental health have been a meaningful and important progress. But that doesn’t mean there aren't things to watch out for. Firstly, not all discussion about mental health has a positive impact and not everyone is being included in these conversations. There is a risk that the conversation about mental health isn’t reaching those who need it or including people from all backgrounds and stages of life. Stigma and shame still exist and there are real barriers to people speaking about their own mental health with friends and family. We need to be vigilant of content, especially online and on social media, that is misleading, shaming or inaccurate. Secondly, some people have argued that increased awareness could be leading to an increase in mental health problems. We don’t believe that greater awareness is causing poorer mental health. In fact, it has been doing a vital role in lifting the lid on the extent of the distress people experience. However, there is some evidence that awareness can lead to over-interpretation of mental health struggles and questions about the possibilities of inaccurate self-diagnosis. We need a response that helps people respond to challenges in a measured way while upholding the precautionary principle to take all concerns seriously. Creating a dichotomy between ‘real’ mental illness and those who are ‘just struggling with normal life’ is not helpful if it means we don’t understand they are often linked, or we see some groups as deserving of support and others not. A diagnostic label or clinical help is not always needed or appropriate. But we also know that the risk of poor mental health is increased when difficult emotions are hidden, dismissed, or trivialised. Finally, there is a risk that the awareness efforts neglect the more complex aspects of mental health or sideline the experience of those severely affected by mental ill-health.  This is important to acknowledge and address. There must be space for the full range of experiences to be seen and heard, and efforts made to reduce stigma for all. All of these riskscall for better awareness, not less.We need the conversation on mental health to be evidence-based, genuinely inclusive, embrace complexity, grapple with the root causes and challenge stigma wherever we find it. As with cancer, heart disease, or type 2 diabetes, we are not paying enough attention to prevention and how to stay healthy.  We need more investment in the social infrastructure that keeps us well alongside equipping people with the knowledge and tools to live well. We have seen from our experience of the Covid pandemic, cost-of-living crisis and the impact of global conflict just how damaging it is when the mental health implications are under-estimated or ignored. And this is a key point: it doesn’t take much to shame us into hiding our experience. We cannot allow mental health to be overlooked or the progress gained to be undone.  Our approach must evolve, but we can’t go back. This means more effective literacy about how to positively nurture our mental health (like this year’sMental Health Awareness Week theme of moving more) as well as focusing on the building blocks of good mental health – things like financial security, good housing, and access to nature for all. This matters because mental health isn’t an equal playing field . While anyone can struggle with their mental health, it’s much more likely if you are poor, have faced racial or other discrimination, or had significant difficulties in childhood or as an adult.  But investing in building good mental health has the potential not only to alleviate distress but reduce inequalities, bolster the economy and reduce demand for services. As Mental Health Awareness Week approaches, let's celebrate the huge strides we’ve made. Let’s re-double our commitment to foster awareness that drives meaningful change because everyone deserves good mental health.  12th May 2025

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/running-cambrian-way-mental-health-jareds-story,Running the Cambrian Way for mental health: Jared’s story,"Location:Wales Jared Linter, 22, from Portsmouth, will be running the Cambrian Way to raise funds for the Mental Health Foundation. Designated one of the UK’s hardest trails, it takes in almost 300 miles of Wales’ most beautiful scenery, including 46 peaks, which have the same total elevation as two Mount Everests. Support Jared's fundraiser “I found my latest fundraiser by accidentally misspelling the Cumbrian Way – it’s kind of the daftest way you could find out about an ultra-run,” says Jared Linter. >Jared already has several epic challenges under his belt – walking the West Highland Way, cycling 600 miles to France from Portsmouth, and running the 100-mile South Downs Way in 23 hours. But the self-confessed running fanatic was keen to find a new fundraiser, stumbling across the 300-mile hike across Wales by accident. He will be training during Mental Health Awareness Week this year, expecting to run 100k during the week, and plans to kick off his Cambrian Way Ultrarun later in the summer. “When I told my Mum and Dad that I was going to run the South Downs Way, she said: “But you can drive that, why would you run it? But for me, I enjoy the struggle to succeed.” And it’s not just the challenge that’s the reason for Jared’s running regime and extreme physical events. Having struggled with generalised anxiety over the past few years, he finds exercise and movement give him the space he needs to manage his mental health. He said: “Running is a journey of stretching my mental and physical threshold, allowing me to redefine all my limits. This gives me control over the body I am confined within, and I use that in everyday life. “I use running as a way to mediate, a way to reflect on everything that makes me anxious and that gives me some sort of control over that. Running is the most accessible sport and natural spaces are beautiful, so to combine that is a perfect match.” “If I didn’t exercise, I’d get stuck inside my head really easily. The main thing I get from running is getting away from the external stresses of my life, where I can find myself spending too much time reflecting on myself, or my life, or my worries, and not enough time living in the moment. Movement helps me live in the moment.” Read our tips to help you get moving more for your mental health. Available in English and Welsh.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/fitness-community-helps-parents-mental-health,Fitness community helps parents' mental health,"Location:Wales Mark Lloyd (known as Lloydy), 49, and parent of two, runs a group training fitness business calledBrawdin Barry, Vale of Glamorgan. He started Brawd in 2013, leaving behind his job at a multi-national company. What started as a bootcamp soon turned into a permanent community fixture on Barry Island Beach, with fitness training that emphasises fun and camaraderie. “I was working in a big multi-national and had broken my ankle on a stand up paddle boarding accident. Whilst I was lying there, in bed, feeling sorry for myself, an opportunity came up to run a bootcamp. I knew that it would work in the area I live in, so I went in and that was how we started in 2013”. The challenges of parenting can put people under increased pressure that can lead to feelings of anxiety and overwhelm.  If not supported this could develop into more significant mental health problems. Mark is a parent of two children, 13 and 8 years old. “I always found training helpful to me, if I didn’t exercise a few times a week my mental health would dip a bit. I think now, it’s more important than ever because I’m a parent, I own Brawd,  I’m very, very busy. It’s sometimes overwhelming and you get stuck in your head, and I think movement and exercise is so important. “Movement is probably the number one thing you can do to improve or change your state, people come into the gym feeling exhausted and low. And everyone leaves feeling better.  You move, you change your state – the biggest influence you can have on your mental state is to move, you can walk, you can swim, you can do a gym, come to Brawd, do anything!” “Even if I couldn’t move, I’d find some sort of technique; I’ve done mindfulness, I’ve done meditation, all sorts of stuff. Just being out in nature. There’s lots of things you can do – not just the gym. It’s so important for your own mental health.” In our UK polling*, we found that parents with children under the age of 18 were more likely than the general population to be stopped from doing physical activity in a typical week because of stress, high-cost, and being too busy. Mark adds that around nine out of ten of his members are parents. “If you want to change your life, have a child. It’s the biggest life changing event ever and no-one preps you for this. Today we are trying to have careers, conflicts of work, your other half, kids, and it’s ‘Woah’!” “The biggest thing I would say for parents is that you’ve got kids, which take up 100% of your time, you have to look after yourself. It’s not selfish. Your kids would much rather see you going to the gym and looking after yourself because you will feel better and be a better parent. “You’ve got to put diary time in for yourself – it can be 2 hours a week door-to-door, you’ve got to find that time for yourself. Whether that’s at Brawd or walking round the beaches or even a coffee with someone, you’ve got to do it!” “The other bit of what we do is the community, you do make friends. It’s a social environment, you do group training. It’s all about people working together for that 45 minutes, come in – do your stuff, have fun!” “People that join us on a campaign, are nervous about being fit, ‘I won’t fit in’, ‘I’ve never done anything like this before’, ‘what if I get left behind’, ‘it will be too hard for me’. The what ifs.. I think the main thing is fear. The reality is that that’s just in your head.” “100% is don’t just say it, do it! Because doing trumps everything. I’ve got a bit of a mantra that if I commit to something, to someone I follow through with it. It’s the first step for yourself. Action trumps everything."" “Ignore yourself – ignore the stuff going on in your head because it’s really easy; we think it’s hard, but we do all these things that are hard like parenting and work, and that’s hard, we do it. But actually, just walking through the door is quite easy.” *Polling of 6,000 UK adults aged 18 and over was carried out by Opinium on behalf of the Mental Health Foundation.  The survey took place between 12 and 24 March 2024 and figures are weighted to be nationally representative.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/looking-after-my-mental-health-one-move-time-bethans-story,Looking after my mental health one move at a time: Bethan's story,"Location:England Last month, Bethan Davies completed the London Marathon for the Mental Health Foundation in memory of her friend Jon, known by his mates as Gitts, who she lost to suicide last year. Jon had cheer-leaded Bethan when she did her first marathon over a decade ago in Cork and he was in her mind during every training run that led up to the race a few weeks ago. In addition to honouring her friend, Bethan has so far raised a phenomenal £4,575 for the charity – more than doubling the target set, and raised much needed awareness of mental health issues that she also acknowledges facing. Bethan reflects; “I’ve had some poor experiences with my own mental health, mostly from mismanagement or complete lack of management of my ADHD, resulting in burnout and breakdowns.” Bethan recognises how much movement is an important part of her life and how it supports her mental health; “Movement is everything for me – from the endorphins and getting out any negative energy that builds up, to feeling stronger inside and out, it’s life-changing for me. “I feel much happier, calmer, and more focussed after movement, and that radiates throughout the rest of my day and week. I just don’t feel like myself if I haven’t dedicated time to myself to work out or even just walk outside, it can make me feel quite blue. “It’s been a long process of learning what supports me to live more healthily in all ways, and movement – in particular outdoor, mindful or fun movement like dance – has been key to managing my mental health better. I couldn’t be without it now.” Bethan has movement in mind throughout Mental Health Awareness Week and will be participating in a series of activities. “I’m doing a Movement May challenge with a friend of mine. We used to often do a lot of online workouts together, but haven’t for a while, and have both felt like we want to get back to it! So, this activity will fall within Mental Health Awareness Week, which is lovely.” Bethan is also taking part in Vibes yoga at an event in her hometown of Cardiff as part of a whole host of activities atCardiff’s Mermaid Quayto mark Mental Health Awareness Week. A keen runner, Bethan shares how training for the London Marathon in aid of the Mental Health Foundation helped her beat the blues. “This year, training for the London Marathon meant I was out running in daylight hours in the darkest depths of winter at least two to three times a week, and it made a huge difference to my mental health.” “Running has given me the opportunity to have space and process different things over the course of the last year. I think it’s made me a much more chill person. “Running has taught me a lot over the last year, including how amazing and resilient your body and brain can be. But beyond that, movement has always brought me lots of joy.” Bethan, who is the owner of comms agency‘Cause, spends her time between Cardiff and South West London. “I run my own business which has its challenges, but I have also built the business in a way that lets me prioritise the things that help my mental health – and movement is top of that list, alongside rest! I’m asthmatic and a coeliac, so I do get sick a lot, and those days when I can’t move much, I do struggle. But even then I tend to pop on aYoga with Adrienne– there are videos likeYoga for when you are sick– because I know it helps me. I try to do at least 10 mins of yoga every day to calm my system before I start the day – sometimes I am good at keeping to this, sometimes not but it helps!” The end of Mental Health Awareness Week (19 May), marks a very special day for Bethan as she celebrates her birthday. “I will hopefully be supporting runners in the Cardiff Bay 10km, likely very jealous that I won’t be taking part, but my injuries need a break from running! I’m looking forward to some of the more low-impact sessions that will be on that day too.” “I really recommend doing something you’re really bad at! The silliness of being bad at something is actually really fun. And even just dancing around the house, or in a class- it can really help you shake off anxiety and stress. I understand it’s difficult to take those steps, and do the things that help a lot of the time, but it’s worth a try. It’s hard, because when you’re having a tough time, that’s when you let prioritising movement slip, but it’s actually when you need it most.” Read our tips to help you get moving more for your mental health.

Having sought support for suicidal feelings, anxiety and an eating disorder, his therapist recommended The Running Charity.  This has had a huge impact on him and his mental health. “I think my first experience of running was trying to warm up on my way home, while getting used to the cold North Manchester weather!” Sami is from Pakistan, and has lived in Manchester for more than 10 years. “Cricket was encouraged at home, and football encouraged in Manchester, but I didn’t want to do either! If you’d have told me I'd be a keen runner 5 years ago I would not have believed you, I’d have said you were dreaming.” “I’ve struggled with my mental health in the past, I've been suicidal, had anxiety and an eating disorder. “My therapist recommendedThe Running Charity, an organisation that has made a big, and positive, difference to me.” Sami spoke about running giving him a sense of control, helping him establish positive coping mechanisms and building his confidence over time. “I’d take part in one-on-one running sessions at first. Someone would pick me up and take me for a run, it’s hard to say no or stay in bed on a rainy day when someone is waiting outside for you! “It’s nice when you know you can do something and that you can finish a task (like a run). This sense of achievement has benefitted me, I think it’s helped me established positive ways to express my emotions. “I think setting goals are important, and you can see the progress you make over time. I started slow and used to run from bench to bench and be so out of breath, but now I’m about to run my second marathon!” Sami was keen to emphasise that running wasn’t the only option, and that we can benefit from all sorts of movement, big and small. “I think it’s about finding some form of movement you enjoy and sticking to it. You’ll see the results, even if just over time. Making progress as you go along can make a big difference."" Our survey found more than 3 in 10 young people said they were too busy with work or study to exercise, with 35% of young people compared to 22% for the rest of the population. Sami spoke about the pressures academic and employment pressures facing young people in the UK, and additional pressures that come with being an asylum seeker here. “If, you’re like me, and seeking asylum in the UK, you can’t work in paid employment, but I keep myself busy, I have lots of voluntary roles and even a role at the University. ""I think movement, and running, help make me express my emotions and my worries. I’ve learnt to use running as a way of coping and processing.  “I think cost can be a barrier to exercise, for young people, people seeking sanctuary, and lots of others too. “I remember hating PE at school, I would not want people to see me getting changed and I'd keep my PE kit on underneath my school outfit. I’d be conscious of my trainers, which were old compared to my classmates."" Sami spoke about the low cost that makes running so appealing. He spoke about gyms and exercise classes being unaffordable, and that running can usually take place wherever you are, at whatever time. “Gym memberships are expensive  but running is free! I can run whenever and wherever, even at 3am, if I want to.""  Sami spoke about finding the sport or movement that is right for you, emphasising that it doesn’t have to be running. “It could be hockey, football, skating, swimming, walking, any sort of movement, dance, I dunno, anything! Just go for it, and do it!” “I try not to benchmark against other people, but against the goals I want to accomplish. I’ve gone from bench to bench, to park run, to running lots by myself and with a community, now I'm about to run my second marathon, and I'm doing the Edinburgh marathon this year. Remember, movement can take many forms and you can start slow, just slowly build up, small steps!” Read our tips to help you get the mental health benefits of movement.

For 55-year-old Dave Roberts it’s a daily juggle between moving enough to support his mental health – and not overdoing it too much and face impacting on his physical health. Dave, from Conwy, North Wales, lives with, among other conditions, chronic spinal osteoarthritis, a rare endocrine tumour syndrome and Addisons disease. The former police officer is in constant pain, and some days are good, and others are bad. “Some days the pain is so bad that you don’t want to get out bed, and want the pain to stop. There’s only one way that the pain will stop, and I have been close to doing something stupid. But I’m lucky to have a wonderful family around me,” he says. He also finds mental health support through his cold-water therapy: an inflatable cold water tub in the garden, cold water swimming in lakes, such as Llanberis, or even a cold shower. Walking – or sometimes when the pain is too much, just playing – at the beach with his dogs also brings him joy. “Being in the cold water is a way of coping, you’re in your own world for a couple of minutes; there’s nothing but you and the cold water. Lying back and looking up at the sky,” he says: “It really clears my head.” “Reaching out for help is hard to do – I was of the mindset that I couldn’t ask for help. I was so used to helping others, that I didn’t know how to ask for help. But it’s important to ask for help and know how to help yourself. Making that first step is the hardest. You could start with talking to your GP, or looking online like I did, and came acrossVersus Arthritis. Either you can just read articles, or phone up and speak to them, and often the information they have relates to more than just your condition. “Some days it is a struggle to get out of bed and you just know it’s a bad day, so you have to work what to do to get through it. For me, that’s the cold tub, or a walk on the dog with the beach. But it’s a balance, some days I’ll walk too far, and pay for it that night because the pain is too much to sleep. “But it’s a trade-off. It’s going to get worse and my mental health will suffer if I don’t move, so I have to move.” He added: “It’s good to get the body moving. It’s an achievement. It might not be a big achievement for some people, but it is for me. Simply by being able to do it.” The biggest barrier to exercise is the mental effort of wondering whether you can manage or not, Dave says: “If you look at this vast beach, often I wonder will I be able to walk and get back.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/i-couldnt-manage-my-mental-health-without-exercising-christinas-story,I couldn't manage my mental health without exercising: Christina's story,"Location:England Christina talks about how living with Type 1 Diabetes, and seven other auto-immune conditions, makes exercise difficult – but how essential it is to support her mental and physical health.  Type 1 diabetes means my body doesn’t produce insulin, so I must wear an insulin pump 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. Without the insulin it gives me I’d die. It’s pretty complicated, but when you boil it down that’s pretty much the end result. I work hard everyday to keep myself alive! I was diagnosed ten years ago this year. But I also live with a whole bunch of other things, underactive thyroid, pernicious anemia, so I need B12 shots every eight weeks, and Sjogren's syndrome to name a few. It’s a pretty complicated picture. So I do struggle sometimes with my mental health. Spending every day in fight-flight to keep myself alive is draining and leaves you feeling a bit on edge at times. Not to mention if I have to wake up in the night to treat my blood sugars – tiredness has a bit impact on mood. Exercise is a complicated one, as it massively impacts my blood sugars. So every time I just even go for a walk I have to think – what have I eaten, how much insulin is in my body, and where am I going? Or if I plan to exercise, I have to do lots of prep – setting less insulin on the pump, and thinking about meals. It’s a barrier for sure. But I couldn’t manage my mental health without exercising. I ran a 10k a few years ago and the feel-good hormones after running are the best! Sadly, I’ve now got osteoarthritis in my knee now so can’t run. But I’m walking and using the cross-trainer, and strength training. I’m also a big fan of some Yin Yoga. My favourite exercise though is my morning walk with my husband, through the cycle paths, trees, or to see the sea. We’re very lucky where we live. Even though it’s hard sometimes, and I maybe end up hypo (low blood sugars), and occasionally crying in the kitchen eating jelly babies, I think not moving would make things worse, both mentally and physically.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/why-movement-mental-health-awareness-week,Why movement this Mental Health Awareness Week?,"Location:England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland It’s Mental Health Awareness Week again. We look forward to this week every May since we first launched the campaign in 2001. Over the years it has grown to be a prominent fixture in the calendar of not just the mental health sector but more widely with schools, workplaces, and organisations of all kinds getting involved. It’s a chance to get the whole of the UK focused on mental health, the things that help to protect and nurture it, and encouraging greater openness about our experiences of poor mental health. This year we’re focusing on moving more for our mental health, but why is this our chosen theme? We know that even the thought of starting “exercise” can be off-putting to many people and that’s why we’re focusing on movement to make you feel good. At a very basic level, physical activity means any movement of your body that uses your muscles and expends energy. One of the great things about moving more is that there are possibilities to suit almost everyone. Benefits of movement for mental health range from improved mood, reduced anxiety, lowered inflammation and stress, improved memory and concentration, increased confidence, improved sleep and even increased social connectedness. Often dubbed the ‘miracle cure’, movement is also one of the few proven routes to prevent poor mental health. A study of over one million Americans on the association between physical and mental health found regular movers reported 12-23% lower levels of mental health problems than sedentary participants when matched for gender, income, and other factors. If you are just starting out, have caring responsibilities, or work long hours, it’s important to remember that even short bursts of movement are beneficial. As little as15 minutes of movement a day has been shown to positively impact mental health(although the more often we move, the bigger the benefit). Considering the many benefits of moving, can you think of anything else that could have the same protective power and mental health benefits? If you ask people about movement and physical activity, the vast majority will say that it benefits both physical health and mental wellbeing. In fact, we did ask and more than eight in ten people shared that opinion. If we understand that it’s good for us, why are so many of us not able to incorporate regular movement into our daily lives?  That is what we wanted to explore inour report published today. We polled 6000 adults across the UK and conducted focus groups so we could speak directly to people who live at an increased risk of poor mental health. This included parents, young people, asylum seekers and refugees, and people living with long term health conditions. We wanted to better understand the barriers to movement and, in turn, the barriers to one of the most powerful actions available to us to protect our mental health. In theory movement should be readily available to everyone. But as with many thingswe can do as individuals to protect our mental health, it is much easier to be physically active if we feel secure in our homes, have adequate income, are not living with a long-term health condition and are not subject to racism or discrimination. This was confirmed in our Mental Health Awareness Week research when we found common barriers like the weather, costs, feeling too tired, stressed or anxious are more likely to be a hurdle for people who are already facing disadvantage in their lives.We found people needed more support to find local activities and at a low cost. There are also challenges that come with modern living. While technological advancements bring many conveniences it also means that now, more than any time in human history, we can survive, work, engage in hobbies, see our friends and family… all without doing any physical movement at all. By not having to move out of necessity, many of us struggle to do the minimum amount of movement set out by the World Health Organisation (150 minutes a week). So, what can be done? Being able to protect our own mental health is not a luxury. Too many of us are denied the chance to do things that are good for mental health because of the wider circumstances of our lives. Recognising the barriers to movement people face is a vital first step and we need our local and national governments to be active encouraging more movement, levelling up access and tackling barriers and we’ll be taking that message to our parliaments this week. Movement is too powerful a force for our mental health for people to miss out on. Mental Health Awareness Week is also an important time to explore the ways we can support each other to find our #MomentsForMovement and get the most mental health benefits from movement. We need to find things we enjoy. If it's fun, we'll want to keep doing it. Connecting with others, getting out in nature, planning activity to look forward to are allevidence-based tipswe're sharing to help people squeeze the mental health benefits from movement. So, we want you to find the movement that’s right for you. We invite you to share your #MomentsForMovement, ideas and talk about how it makes you feel. Tag the Mental Health Foundation to be part of the #MentalHealthAwarenessWeek conversation.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/what-can-we-expect-mental-health-next-parliament,What can we expect for mental health in the next parliament?,"Location:England, Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland As we enter this General Election, we know mental health is going in the wrong direction. Levels of poor mental health are rising, there are an estimated 1.2 million people on NHS waiting lists in England1, and 1 in 4 people experience a diagnosable mental illness in a given year.2 However, the prevention of many mental health problems is possible. The evidence is clear that it is the places and circumstances in which people are born, grow, study, live and work that have a powerful influence on their mental health.3We need to make sure everyone has access to the key building blocks of mental health, including decent housing, financial security, and freedom from discrimination. To move to a more preventative approach to mental health as a country, we need a comprehensive cross-government plan, alongside the funding to make it happen. We also require investment in specific areas that the evidence shows will reduce mental health problems, including: We have set out below a range of the commitments that the main parties have made in each of these areas. We have also included links to each of the manifestos at the end of this blog, where you can find further details of all the policies mentioned. Alongside other mental health charities, we have beenadvocatingfor the need for a comprehensive long-term plan for mental health. Responsibility for the social determinants of mental health is spread across different government departments and requires a truly long-term cross-government approach. Such a plan would allow a government to connect the work of different departments to tackle the risk factors of mental ill-health. Disappointingly, none of the parties seeking to lead the next administration in Westminster commit to this in their manifestos. This is a real missed opportunity. Throughout the next parliamentary term, we will be continuing to press whoever forms the next administration of the urgent need for this approach.4 Existing evidence demonstrates that many new parents experience mental ill health.5This is also recognised in theWomen’s Health Strategyannounced in the previous parliament. In these new manifestos, theConservativeshave pledged improved“access to mental health services for new mums.”TheLiberal Democratsare advocating a “transformation of mental health support for those who are pregnant.” TheSNPare arguing for increased paid maternity leave to one year. We need proactive policy approaches to tackle the problems in perinatal mental health. The above policies begin that journey, but more detail will be needed upon the next government being formed. Preventative mental health measures in schools have been demonstrated to be one of the most effective methods to prevent future mental ill-health. They also represent very good value for money.6 We have been vocal about the necessity for many of the measures announced in the manifestos. These include the expansion of mental health support teams to 100% of schools and colleges in England by 2030 as announced by theConservativesor the specialist mental health counsellors suggested by theLabour Party. Specialist staff and counsellors in schools have also been advocated by theLiberal Democrats, theGreen Party, andPlaid Cymru. However, these policies are only a starting point. We also need whole school approaches to mental health and wellbeing which would incorporate anti-bullying programmes and targeted programmatic work, alongside an implementation of atrauma informed approach. For most of us work is where we spend most of our time. It is essential that our workplaces and working conditions support us to have good mental health. TheLiberal Democratshave committed to giving all employees “a right to request a fixed-hours contract after 12 months for ‘zero hours’ and agency workers, not to be unreasonably refused.”Labourand theSNPhave also pledged to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, This is an area we have written about in our report onzero-hours contracts and mental health. Meanwhile,Reform UKpledge tax relief for businesses that undertake apprenticeships. Apprenticeships can be a positive tool to help people into good work. We support the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and Trussell TrustGuarantee our EssentialsCampaign. This campaign calls on the UK government to enshrine in law the principle that the basic rate of Universal Credit at least covers the essentials that people need to live.Plaid Cymruand theSNPalso express their support for this in their manifestos, alongside demanding the scrapping the two child cap on benefits. TheLiberal Democratsand theGreen Partyalso say that they will scrap the two child cap. Theevidenceindicates that the cap has a negative impact on mental health. We have also been calling for acompassionate, trauma-informed approachto our social security system. Any reforms to the welfare system must take this into account and support, rather than damage people’s mental health. We will be keeping a close eye on how the next administration operates in this policy area. Our relationship with nature – how much we notice, think about and appreciate our natural surroundings – is critical in supporting good mental health and preventing distress. Thankfully, there appears to be similar thinking here. TheConservativeshave aimed to ensure “everyone to have access to nature within 15 minutes’ walk of where they live,”with theLabour Partycommitted to getting more children active and improving access to nature and theLiberal Democratsincreasing the amount of accessible green space. Whoever forms the next government must now follow through on these commitments and deliver these benefits. Our mental health is affected by a whole range of social, environmental, physical, and economic factors. We need bold new policy and community approaches that enable us to thrive and that reduce our risk of poor mental health. Mental ill-health can also be caused by commercial organisations seeking to maximise the consumption of their products. This includes things like junk food, smoking, and alcohol. We have previously outlined our support for theTobacco and Vapes Bill, and are pleased to see theConservative PartyandLabour Partycommit to a version of this, and theLiberal Democratsto actions on vaping. We know that we need a wider preventative approach to public mental health, and are pleased to see language included on this in both theLiberal DemocratsandLabour Partymanifestos. One of ourcallsfor the election has also been the restoration of the public health grant which has seen a £1bn real-terms cut since 2015, when population growth is taken into account. This has been included in theGreen Partymanifesto. The public health grant should be used by local authorities to fund preventative interventions including public mental health interventions, and is imperative to a successful public health approach to mental health. We arrive at this election with mental health going in the wrong direction. This needs to change. All of the political parties propose policies to address this and tackle the social determinants of mental ill-health; this is to be applauded. Yet much more is needed. We need a long-term cross-government plan for mental health, and a greater commitment to supporting the mental health of refugees and asylum seekers. We will be continuing to advocate for these policies throughout the next parliamentary term, whoever should form the next administration with the aim of helping to deliver better mental health for all. MHF is a non-partisan charity that does not endorse any political party. We work with politicians of all parties to further our goal of better mental health for everyone.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/digital-peer-support-people-long-covid,Digital peer support for people with Long Covid,"Location:Wales The Mental Health Foundation and Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB)took peer support online to support people with Long Covid in North Wales. “I feel like I’m living life behind a pane of glass”. Feeling understood, feeling connected with others who share your experiences, and feeling validated are some of the many positive outcomes people gain from peer support groups. Peer support models are a well evidenced intervention, and the Mental Health Foundation has developed significant expertise in the development and delivery of peer support approaches. One of the strengths of peer support models is their adaptability. They are shaped by the participants to fit the reality of their lives. The Covid 19 pandemic disrupted everybody’s lives, having a devastating impact on many. For some groups of people the pandemic has left a lasting and enduring legacy of harm that continues to have an impact on a daily basis. One of these groups is people with Long Covid. As life started to return to normal for some people, people with Long Covid were having to adjust to a new normal. “It’s almost like you are grieving for what you have lost. Normal has walked away from us. I feel robbed.” Over 200,000 people in Wales had confirmed cases of Covid, and research suggests that 1 in 3 survivors go on to be diagnosed with a neurological or psychiatric condition within six months, including anxiety and depression. In response to this urgent need, Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB) and the MHF partnered to develop and embed mental health support alongside interventions to improve the physical symptoms of people with Long Covid. Using MHF's expertise, a peer support model was co-produced with BCUHB and people with Long Covid, to support and improve their mental health. An innovative digital peer support model was developed which reduced the barriers to participating for people living with Long Covid, and delivered improved outcomes for participants, with one participant describing the group as “a lifeline”. The Digital Peer Support Model can be replicated and developed at scale and enables participants to be reached who would not be able to access in-person peer support groups. As well as developing, testing, and evidencing a model of Digital Peer Support for people with Long Covid, MHF also created a toolkit for BCUHB. The toolkit is being used to train and support BCUHB staff and partners to roll out and embed the Digital Peer Support model enabling the mental health of people with Long Covid to be improved along with their physical symptoms. “I’m angry that I’m not the person I was 2 years ago. I’ve lost my job; had to move to a bungalow…Nobody understands unless you’ve had it.” To find out more about developing digital peer support approaches take a look at the digital resources that were created, or get in touch atwales@mentalhealth.org.uk.

Mae teimlo eich bod yn cael eich deall, teimlo'n gysylltiedig ag eraill sy'n rhannu eich profiadau, a theimlo'n ddilys yn rhai o'r canlyniadau cadarnhaol niferus y mae pobl yn eu cael o grwpiau cymorth gan gymheiriaid. Mae modelau cymorth gan gymheiriaid yn ymyriad y mae tystiolaeth dda yn perthyn iddynt, ac mae’r Sefydliad Iechyd Meddwl wedi datblygu arbenigedd sylweddol wrth ddatblygu a chyflwyno dulliau cymorth gan gymheiriaid. Un o gryfderau modelau cymorth gan gymheiriaid yw eu gallu i addasu. Maent yn cael eu llunio gan y cyfranogwyr i gyd-fynd â realiti eu bywydau. Fe wnaeth y pandemig Covid 19 amharu ar fywydau pawb, gan gael effaith ddinistriol ar lawer. I rai grwpiau o bobl mae pandemig Covid 19 wedi gadael etifeddiaeth barhaol a pharhaus o niwed sy'n parhau i gael effaith o ddydd i ddydd. Un o'r grwpiau hyn yw pobl â Covid Hir. Wrth i fywyd ddechrau dychwelyd i normalrwydd i rai pobl, roedd yn rhaid i bobl â Covid Hir addasu i normal newydd. “Mae bron fel eich bod chi'n galaru am yr hyn rydych chi wedi'i golli. Mae normal wedi cerdded i ffwrdd oddi wrthym. Rwy'n teimlo bod bywyd wedi'i ddwyn oddi arna' i”. Cafodd dros 200,000 o bobl yng Nghymru achosion wedi'u cadarnhau o Covid, ac mae ymchwil yn awgrymu bod 1 o bob 3 o'r goroeswyr yn mynd ymlaen i gael diagnosis o gyflwr niwrolegol neu seiciatrig o fewn chwe mis, gan gynnwys gorbryder ac iselder. Mewn ymateb i’r angen brys hwn, mae Bwrdd Iechyd Prifysgol Betsi Cadwaladr (BIPBC) a’r MHF wedi partneru i ddatblygu ac ymgorffori cymorth iechyd meddwl ochr yn ochr ag ymyriadau i wella symptomau corfforol pobl â Covid Hir. Gan ddefnyddio arbenigedd MHF, lluniwyd model cymorth gan gymheiriaid ar y cyd â BIPBC a phobl â Covid Hir, i gefnogi a gwella eu hiechyd meddwl. Datblygwyd model cymorth gan gymheiriaid digidol arloesol a leihaodd y rhwystrau i gyfranogiad ar gyfer pobl sy’n byw gyda Covid Hir, ac a sicrhaodd well canlyniadau i gyfranogwyr, gydag un cyfranogwr yn disgrifio’r grŵp fel “achubiaeth”. Gellir ailadrodd y Model Cymorth gan Gymheiriaid Digidol a’i ddatblygu ar raddfa fawr ac mae’n galluogi cyrraedd cyfranogwyr na fyddent yn gallu cael mynediad at grwpiau cymorth cymheiriaid yn bersonol. Yn ogystal â datblygu, profi a dangos tystiolaeth o fodel o Gymorth gan Gymheiriaid Digidol i bobl â Covid Hir, creodd MHF becyn cymorth ar gyfer BIPBC hefyd.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/boost-your-childs-mental-health-adventure,Boost your child’s mental health with adventure,"Location:England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland New research by AdventureMinddetails the benefits of adventure for children and the opportunities for learning and development that it can bring, supporting children and young people to live healthy, fulfilling lives. The key elements of adventure include: Co-author of ‘The benefits of adventure for children’ and Adventurer, Belinda Kirk, explains; “Adventure is for everyone. Adventure doesn’t have to be monumental; you don’t have to climb Everest. To kick-start a more adventurous lifestyle, you might simply take small adventurous steps to test yourself. “Adventure experiences for children are diverse. They might include forest schools, high ropes courses, adventurous play, camping, water sports, and climbing, amongst many other activities. Adventures range from once-in-a-lifetime experiences, through to everyday adventures, accessible to all.” Mark Rowland, Chief Executive of the Mental Health Foundation added, ""Adventure helps to generate a range of positive emotions, including excitement, joy and wonder. ""It also helps to develop a healthy relationship to uncertainty. That is so important in boosting confidence and in children learning how to manage fear and anxiety. ""In mental health, there are no silver bullets. But there is huge untapped potential in encouraging children to discover the world around them... and themselves in the process."" Adventure is all about facing challenge and risk. It provides children with exposure to new experiences, making them feel physiologically energised and can provide an opportunity to learn about coping effectively. This in turn can help children to feel more comfortable when faced with future challenges and reduce the likelihood that they will feel anxious and overwhelmed, supporting them to live with good mental health. With that in mind, we have some everyday adventures for you to explore. Challenge yourself and your little ones to try something new this summer. We know thatmovementis good for our mental health, in fact, studies have shown that those who get moving are 12-23% more likely to have lower levels of poor mental health than those who are more sedentary. Set you and your family a challenge to walk, run, cycle or kayak from A to B during a day or a weekend. The excitement of exploring new areas is as primal as it gets. Then there’s the fun of problem-solving along the way. If you don’t make it and have to catch a bus or call for a taxi, that’s OK; it’s all part of the adventure. It’s the stepping outside of your comfort zone and trying that’s important, not the end point. And when you do make it to the destination, the feeling of exhilaration is second to none. Start small and keep it simple; the most important thing is that you give it a go. All you need to pack is a swimming costume, a towel and an open mind. There are many wild-swimming communities and websites now that offer advice on locations, safety tips and organised events. CheckWild Swimming Map UKfor spots near you. Start in the summer, watch where others are swimming regularly, take a friend and walk in – don’t jump into water you’ve not swum in before. Make wild swimming family-friendly with an alfresco swim by visiting a local lido. One of the biggest adventures, and also most valuable life-saving skill, is to learn to swim. Get inspired by our Olympic swimming team, many of whom started out by having a dip in their local leisure centres. There are lots of crash courses running daily and weekly throughout the summer. Bouldering is in fashion at the moment, for good reason. Not only is it incredible form of exercise but a bouldering wall offers your family a relatively safe space where they can prove to themselves what they are capable of. They can test themselves against climbing routes that seem, from the bottom, to be too hard for them. But with an introduction to the basic techniques, a little emotional support and some patience, they can show themselves that they are capable of more than they thought. And all of this is available in most towns and cities. You don’t even have to scale huge wall-faces, bouldering just a foot or two off the ground gives the same effect and children can participate safely under professional supervision at most walls. If you don’t have a centre nearby, the same effect can be achieved outside, free of charge with some amateur parkouring. No need for extreme sports, any small obstacle or feature of your urban environment can become a moment of excitement. What about an obstacle course through the local park for some friendly competition? The Mental Health Foundation organises a range ofadrenalin-pumping challengesand our CEO and Adventurer, Mark Rowland, leads by example, taking part in sky dives and is a keenultra-marathon runner. Struggling for ideas? Explorer Belinda Kirk, who co-authored this research, also runsExplorers Connecta not-for-profit organisation and knows a thing or two about adventures - big or small! Weather is something you cannot control and British weather is very changeable! Rather than avoiding the rain and wind, choose to run in it! Go on your own ‘Bear Hunt’ ‘swish, swash’ across grass, ‘splish splash’ in puddles and the sea and ‘squelch’ about in the mud. TIP: For big and little kids alike. The natural rhythm of the sun is something the majority of us take for granted, but sunsets and sunrises are breath-taking and can induce feelings of awe. Walking into the approaching darkness just as everyone else is settling in for the night or cycling into the sunrise gives a sense of extra excitement and challenge. Even following a route in the dark that is familiar to you in the daytime is a novel experience; you’ll use different senses, and it will feel like a different world. It’s a great way to experience real adventure and excitement with little planning or travel. Camping is a guaranteed adventure, no matter how many times you’ve done it, and spending nights outside is one of the simplest ways to live more adventurously. An easy start is to camp in your (or your friend’s) garden. Once you progress further afield, try a wilderness campsite instead of a site that has all the modern conveniences and distractions. Immerse yourself in nature and the experience. Connecting with nature is a key element of adventure and is recognised as benefiting our mental health. Our 2021 report'How connecting with nature benefits our mental health'found that 70% of UK adults agreed being close to nature improves their mood, and 49% said being close to nature helps them to cope with stress. If you don’t have access to a garden, get in touch with your local guides and scouts who can provide space to access and experience a night outdoors. Campfire cooking is brilliant fun, and if you’ve never tried it before, it’s the perfect time to give it a go. Get inspiration:5 Foods You Can Cook on a Campfire. Garden camping is an excellent way to introduce camping to children. Getideas and tipsfor spending a night in the garden. Spending a night under the stars away from civilisation is a feeling money can’t buy. It’s the ultimate adventure. If you're a beginner, check out:How to Wild Camp: A Beginner's Guide. Campfires can be a great centrepiece for any camping trip, but it is vitally important that you do thissafely.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/views-after-riots-counting-toll-discrimination-and-dehumanising-language,Views after the riots: counting the toll of discrimination and dehumanising language,"Location:England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, Overseas Three weeks ago, a dark – but hopefully very short – chapter in the UK’s history took place. Across the country, our society suffered a wave of racist rioting whipped up by far-right agitators, targeted primarily at refugees and people seeking asylum. While it is possible to count the physical impact of these events in the assaults and property damage, the mental health impact of what occurred is harder to quantify.  It is clear to us though, as an organisationthat works to support the mental health of refugees and people seeking asylumthrough ourVoices and Visibility,Elevate (Scotland), and Bridges to Belonging (Wales & N. Ireland) programmes, that the mental health effects are significantly more widespread and will take a long time to heal. The accounts of our partners and our own staff tell us these riots will only serve to worsen an already unconscionable situation in which people seeking asylum are 5 times more likely to have mental health needs than the general population, and less likely to get support. The recent racist riots have affected not just those communities directly targeted, but refugees and people seeking asylum across the country, as well as racialised communities more generally. Due to the threats and actual violence of the rioters, many of those affected felt scared to leave their homes. People seeking asylum and refugees we work with have experienced an initial sense of shock, followed by confusion and anxiety as people try to understand why this is happening. We’ve heard from one person seeking asylum whose friend was assaulted in the street by racists involved in the disturbances, and the impact that’s had on them. Another has told us that they no longer feel safe going out for walks in the park since seeing the riots in the news. We know that the people we work with come to this country to feel safe – and some have reflected to us that they now worry what the people they are living alongside think of them and whether they may ever feel safe here again. This fear can lead to withdrawal and isolation from their communities as they seek to avoid further threatening situations. What is difficult to understand, however, is how we got here. The causes and impact of these riots are many and complex, and will take years to unpack. But there is one contributory factor that we, as a mental health charity, can very clearly call out today – the use of dehumanising language and discrimination against refugees. Many of us will remember the shock almost a decade agowhen David Cameron referred to a “swarm” of people crossing the channel. There was outrage from across civil society that the then-Prime Minister – who is supposed to uphold the highest standards of public office – had engaged in language akin to politicians from the extreme fringes. In the decade since, the use of this language has only worsened. Last year, former Home Secretary,Suella Braverman, talked of an “invasion” of Britainby people themselves fleeing conflict and suffering. Over the years, discriminating against people seeking asylum has become commonplace in not only language, but also policy. As a new Prime Minister, fresh from a six year stint as the Home Secretary, Theresa Maydefended her creation of a “hostile environment” for people coming to the country, which have had a profoundly negative impact on the lives of migrants, including refugees with a right to live in the UK. These policies have led to refugees and people seeking asylum feeling othered by limiting how they interact with essential parts of society such as healthcare and housing. In turn, these policies became language used to abuse people seeking sanctuary. “Stop the boats” and “send them to Rwanda,” originally policy positions, became favourite chants of the racists. The blame does not only lie with politicians. Some media outlets have regularly referred to people seeking asylum and refugees, who have an inalienable right to request sanctuary in our country, as “illegals” and other derogatory names. In doing so, they have not only twisted public perception of vulnerable people, but have also harmed many refugees and people seeking asylum’s perceptions of themselves. Every use of dehumanising language has an impact, whether it is visible or not. We know that one of the building blocks of good mental health is feeling safe in your environment. That sense of safety is the first thing that we seek to build up when we work with refugees and people seeking asylum. But we cannot expect any racialised communities to feel comfortable in the UK when they hear politicians and parts of the media referring to them in a way that implies they are not just unwelcome – but that they are less than other humans. This can be particularly retraumatising when many people seeking asylum and refugees have fled conflict situations in which powerful people seek to demonise certain groups. The process of seeking asylum is one that itself takes a toll on people’s identity. People seeking asylum and refugees can experience cultural bereavement because of losing their homes, jobs, and families. Feeling isolated from their culture of origin, unaccepted by a new culture and lacking social support can lead people to feel rejection, alienation, and poor self-esteem, all of which are harmful to mental health. So, how do we make sure this never happens again? When the new Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, arrived in July, he promised a “decade of national renewal.” As part of that, we propose that compassion for one another – refugees and people seeking asylum in particular – be central to both the policies the government implements, and the language they use to communicate with us. At the Mental Health Foundation, we will play our part in reminding politicians of the importance of a compassionate, trauma-informed approach to people who have sought sanctuary in our country. Media outlets must consider the impact on communities vulnerable to hatred when they use the sort of discriminatory language which was echoed by the rioters. They must start reflecting the reality that almost every single person seeking sanctuary wants nothing more than to be safe and contribute to the British economy, culture, and society. They should include the voices of those with lived experience of the asylum system in their reporting. We will do our utmost to convince and support them to tell these stories. Truly, it has been a horrific decade for the mental health of people seeking asylum in the UK - but it does not have to be this way. These riots must be a wake-up call to embark on the promised national renewal in a way which places human dignity at the heart of everything we do. We must become a country which makes people seeking asylum feel safe again. Many of us will have felt uplifted by the sight of thousands of counter-protestors, welcoming refugees and outnumbering the agitators. We know that the vast majority of people in this country do not share the values of the rioters. It is now on all of us, but especially leaders in society and the media, to drown out and call out the racist minority, and instead build a Britain that reflects most people’s values – a nation where everyone is treated with compassion and respect. Refugees and asylum seekers face unique challenges related to their mental health and are often at greater risk of developing mental health problems.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/black-history-month-reclaiming-narratives-black-mental-health,Black History Month: Reclaiming narratives for Black mental health,"Location:England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland This year’s Black History Month theme,“Reclaiming Narratives,”calls for a powerful shift in how we recognise, honour, and celebrate the Black, African, and Caribbean communities. This is not just about retelling history; it’s about reawakening and elevating voices that have been too often silenced, ensuring that black experiences are seen, heard, and valued in their full complexity. For too long, the narratives surrounding Black people have been shaped by otherness—often through the narrow lens of adversity and marginalisation. But reclaiming these stories is a bold act of resistance and empowerment. It’s about celebrating Black excellence, resilience, and innovation, while also confronting and correcting the distorted representations that have contributed to systemic racism. Reclaiming narrative is more than a cultural act; it is deeply tied to mental health and well-being. The narratives that society tells about us, and the ones we internalise, play a critical role in shaping our self-esteem, sense of identity, and belonging. When Black people are misrepresented, erased, or reduced to stereotypes, it can have profound effects on mental health and either leading to feelings of invisibility, alienation, and psychological harm. For years, themental health sectorhas acknowledged the disparities faced by black individuals in accessing appropriate mental health care. Despite promises of reform, black communities have historically faced disparities in mental health care, with overrepresentation in acute settings, lower access to culturally appropriate services, and often experience unequal treatment within mainstream services. This disparity extends to outcomes in therapy, where black individuals frequently report worse result outcomes. Black voices are crucial in the mental health conversation, not only to address historical trauma but to advocate for culturally relevant care that truly meets the needs of black communities. In recent years, strides have been made to incorporate cultural competence into mental health services. Mental health programmes and services are beginning to acknowledge the importance of cultural sensitivity, awareness, and responsiveness in therapy. This includes understanding the unique perspectives that members of the Black African and Caribbean communities may have regarding mental health, and the stigma that can sometimes be attached. While many mental health institutions have pledged to address these inequalities, real change has been slow. Black people continue to face significant barriers when it comes to receiving effective mental health support. Despite efforts to incorporate cultural sensitivity, Black individuals often find themselves navigating a system that was not built for them — a system that does not fully understand their experiences, stigmas, or the unique ways in which trauma manifests. Breaking down these barriers requires open conversations across all generations and encouraging everyone to engage in dialogue about mental health and well-being. Reclaiming the narrative in mental health means pushing for systems that reflect the diversity of those they serve. It's about creating tailor-made mental health solutions that meet the needs of black communities, services that acknowledge the cultural context, historical trauma, diversity and lived experiences of black people. Mental health care must move beyond a one-size-fits-all model and instead become an inclusive and multicultural space where black voices and stories are central to the systemic process.At the heart of this movement is a commitment to systems change and co-production, where Black communities are not only heard but play an active role in shaping mental health services. It's about recognising that those with lived experience are experts in their own right and brings invaluable knowledge to the table. Mental health services must evolve through collaboration, with black communities leading the charge in designing solutions that truly meet their needs. Safe spaces for black people to “discuss, share, reclaim, and nurture” are essential to this process. Intergenerational dialogue about mental health can help break down stigmas and create a culture of openness and support within Black communities As we celebrate Black History Month, let us remember that reclaiming narratives is not just about the past, but a call to action for the present and the future. It is a demand for systems change, for mental health services that respect and understand the diversity of black experiences, and for a society where black voices lead the conversation about their own well-being. It’s time to move beyond mere acknowledgment of the need for change.This Black History Month, let us commit to pushing for real, sustained reforms in mental health care — reforms that are grounded in the knowledge, strength, and resilience of black communities.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/managing-mental-health-while-working-shifts,Managing mental health while working shifts,"Shift work is a common type of work schedule, found in healthcare, hospitality, manufacturing and many other workplaces. Here’s a quick guide to understanding and managing those challenges. Shift work means working outside the typical 9-to-5 schedule, often including evenings, nights, early mornings, and weekends. This can disrupt our body's natural rhythm and affect both physical and mental health. Shift work can also blur the lines between work and personal life, making it tough to stick to a routine and maintain work-life balance. Tips for maintaining work-life balance: Working nights or irregular hours can disrupt your sleep, leading to poor sleep quality and deprivation. Tips for better sleep: Shift work can make it hard to maintain a regular routine, leading to stress and disorientation. Tips for managing inconsistency: Unpredictable schedules can make long-term planning challenging, leading to anxiety and frustration. Tips for managing uncertainty: Switching between different teams and shifts can disrupt social connections at work. Tips for enhancing team connection: Night shifts can be especially tough, affecting your body's natural rhythm and increasing stress. Tips for managing night shifts: Shift work can increase the risk of mental health problems like anxiety, depression, and burnout. Look out for persistent sadness, irritability, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and withdrawal from social activities.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/reclaiming-and-liberating-narratives-black-history,Reclaiming and liberating narratives of Black history,"Location:England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland The theme of Black History Month UK 2024 is “Reclaiming Narratives”. Mental Health Foundation Becoming a Man (BAM) Programme Manager and Psychotherapeutic Counsellor Ntale Eastmond shares his interpretation of the theme with a focus on liberation narratives. What is a story? Is it the same as a tale or is it closer to a record? I think all stories rest on a frame, a set of assumptions and truisms that we accept as existing before, throughout, and after the conclusion of the story we are engaging with. History is a telling of a story, like any other. And like any other, the story-teller makes the story what it is, filling it with all they’d like to see and gutting it of everything they’d rather shut their eyes to. We have to be mindful, therefore, who the telling of our stories serves. Michael Taussig said in his article The Sun Gives Without Receiving (1995), “History itself has taken the turn whereby people are increasingly unable to assimilate the data of the world around by way of experience. The capacity to remember is under siege because, in a shell-shocked world, the capacity to experience has had to atrophy”. In the context of Black History Month, these words highlight to me how history has become such a complex tapestry that it unravels into our present. It floods our lives with so much weight that it impedes our ability to experience our lives fully and, thus, to properly remember our individual or collective past. What we remember of Black History is part of this deterioration, the Black experience everywhere mutilated byWhite Supremacy. The narratives of Africans and racialised people the world over have been dismantled and reformed into unrecognisable tales. These stories assimilate and neutralise rather than challenge the dominant ideological frameworks that oppress Black people. Divorced from a just and coherent tale of our own existence, many Black and racialised people are forced into a relationship with themselves that reproduces the ongoing violence ofneocolonialism(quite literally “new colonialism”)2. So, we are led into misinformed reverence of figures such as Barack Obama, but might remain in ignorance of the works of Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o or the leadership of Thomas Sankara. A narrative must be spun. While a spider weaves a home, a tool, a dinner table, for the fly the web is a trap. Perspective isn’t merely based on who spins the narrative or the web, but whom it serves. When a narrative is spun to serve the dispossessed, it can be empowering, but when created in service of the powerful, a story can facilitate generations of pain. It is for this reason that it is so important that Black History is told not merely from the perspective of a Black person, but from the perspective of Black liberation. In his book, “Decolonising the Mind”, Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o (1986) makes the argument that language lies at the centre of a people’s self-identification. He goes on to argue therefore, that the language we use to communicate (and the culture and collective memory encased in language) constitutes a colonial force on the mind. In essence, language is a means through which people are subjugated. If something so fundamental as the body and structure of the words we use to communicate can mediate what, with whom, and the affect with which we communicate, what ideas then might be possibly rendered incommunicable, or even unthinkable through the limitations of our language? Another question: if African peoples and their languages were colonised by European ones, is it even possible to precisely communicate – and consequently understand – who we have become as a result of the very process that birthed colonialism and grew into imperialism and neocolonialism. That process is a capitalist process and, requiring that we all submit to a principal common language to ease the flow of capital around the world in a neocolonial age, it has made the languages of colonial nations all but a necessity for modern life. If we look only to the languages of those peoples that conceptualised and perpetrated the colonial atrocities, can self-discovery for the colonised and their descendants ever be truly achieved? Or must we look instead to the languages produced in and through the experience of those crimes being wrought upon body and soul? In roots reggae and ska, calypso, rumba and salsa, country, blues, jazz, rock and roll and soul we hear the resilient and resistant voices of Maroons and stolen Africans telling their tales in the tongues that their ancestors crafted as they fought colonial violence and domination. From words like “nyam” (meaning “to eat”), found in both Wolof and Jamaican patois, to the very rhythms that find their origins in Africa, language itself is a mode of resistance. From gwo ka to steelpan, punta and areito, we hear the rhythms and dance the dances of those peoples whose very souls survived in languages shorn not from tongue, but from all the sounds of the worlds they saw and struggled through. Language survives with the people themselves. In language and song, the very words we speak reject colonisation, retaining their meaning across oceans and travelling between worlds. These are the narratives that were not reclaimed, but are anti-colonial in their origins. Over the years, we have seen how Black voices have become co-opted by the interests of those who profit from our exploitation. By co-optation, I am referring to the method through which language that is intended to liberate is appropriated, misused and diluted by those that seek to undermine its liberatory effect. Where hip-hop music once emerged as a mode of resistance to police brutality and a forum for Pan-African ideation, the‘fourth branch of the government’(Immortal Technique) quickly  appropriated and repackaged it into a corporatised form to generatemessages that serve capitalism. These narratives spun by Black mouthsfora class that profits from the subordination and exploitation of Black and racialised peoples and, often, the lands they steward, will not serve the interests of those people. The consumption of Blackmediums ofnarration, under the system of capitalism, emerges at the cost of sanitising the narratives themselves. This co-optation has resulted in a wealth of the sharp analysis of and proposed remedies to the conditions of Black people found in the music of musicians like Bob Marley to Dead Prez. If liberation is considered a core condition of mental and communal wellbeing (Riemer et al., 2020), where can the narratives that promote it be found? As Palestine resists, we have seen the narratives of the oppressed push back against the mainstream narratives of the oppressor, connecting the struggles and narratives of many colonised people and moving hearts around the world. Importantly, the Palestinian liberation movement exemplifies a medium of self-narration that is resistant to corporatisation and co-optation. It shows how, through a radical mode of self-narration, it can generate the space for other experiences of oppression to find resonance. South Africa has identified the commonality of the experience of Apartheid there and in Palestine, and in Congo and Sudan we have seen the narratives of resistance to neocolonial violence connect the conditions of people across lands and languages. Narratives hold the power to liberate and to inspire, to connect and entwine. When narratives are told from the perspective of those that seek liberation, they can free us all from the shackles of alienation from our fellow human beings.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/unsung-heroes-black-history-and-mental-health,The unsung heroes of Black history and mental health,"Location:England For Black History Month, we’re celebrating the unsung heroes of Black History and pioneers of mental health. From fighting discrimination in mental health, to innovating psychological practices, we’re highlighting some of the extraordinary individuals who have paved the way in how we understand and support peoples’ mental health – to all of our benefit. Aggrey Burke was born in Jamaica in 1943 and arrived in the UK in 1959. He completed his research fellowship in Birmingham and went on to become the Chair of the Transcultural Psychiatry Society. Burke was appointed the NHS’s first Black British consultant psychiatrist and worked for many years as a psychiatrist and senior lecturer at St George’s Hospital in Tooting, London. Burke's work throughout the 1980s examined how social determinants, especially racism and poverty, are associated with mental illness. He was one of the first clinicians to question the disproportionate number of black men detained in secure mental health hospital wards. Other work included a study on suicide in immigrant Irish, West Indian and Asian people in Birmingham. Burke worked directly with bereaved families to offer them psychological support following the New Cross Massacre, a fire in which 13 young black people died. He also published groundbreaking work looking at racism and sexism in medical schools, which led to an inquiry by the Commission for Racial Equality and changes in admission processes. In a more than 40-year-long career, Aggrey Burke fought tirelessly against discrimination in mental health, sacrificing his own advancement to do so. Born in the American south in 1917, Mamie Phipps Clark went on to become a pioneer of child development studies, spearheading research that became pivotal in the ending of racial segregation in schools. She completed a Masters at Howard University, on the development of racial consciousness, and then became the second ever Black doctoral student at Columbia, alongside her husband Kenneth. Together they completed the famous study, the 'Doll Test'. In the experiment 250 Black children aged 3-7 were asked questions about dolls that were identical apart from race and hair colour. They were asked which doll does the child want to play with, which doll looks nice, which looks nasty. Most of children preferred and assigned positive characteristics to the white doll. The Clarks reported that many southern Black children, with their experiences of racial segregation had internalised a belief in their own racial inferiority. They concluded that integration could help children develop healthy racial self-identification and improve racial relations more generally. The Clark’s research became the ethical basis for the NAACP's case in Brown Vs the board of Education, the conclusion of which was the banning of racial segregation in public schools. Dr Clark then went on to found the Northside Centre for Child Development in Harlem, one of the first agencies to provide psychological services to Black, minority and poor children. She worked at the centre until her retirement, and also was involved in social service programmes such as the national Head Start Programme, which is active across the US today. Dr Ellen Kitch Childs (1937-1993) was a pioneering clinical psychologist and activist whose work championed gay and lesbian rights. Born in 1937 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, she grew up against a backdrop of racial discrimination, segregation, and the Civil Rights Movement, experiences that profoundly shaped her worldview and activism. Kitch earned her PhD in Human Development at the University of Chicago, one of the first African-American women to do so. During her time in Chicago, she became a founding member of both the Association for Women in Psychology and the Gay Liberation Front at the university. Her activism was deeply intertwined with her professional work, and she was instrumental in challenging the American Psychiatric Association's harmful classification of homosexuality as a mental disorder, a stance that was maintained until 1973. For her efforts, she was honoured in the Chicago LGBT Hall of Fame. Kitch began her own clinical psychology practice, prioritising accessible and inclusive services for the most marginalised groups. She implemented sliding scale fees and offered free services, prioritising Black clients, sex workers, and those living with AIDS, among other groups. Her commitment to inclusivity and social justice was a hallmark of her practice, and of her contributions to the field of psychology. Jacqui Dyer MBE, the Mental Health Foundation’s own President from 2019-24, has also been at the forefront of reform and equality in mental health for over a decade. Jacqui was active in exposing the racism in the disproportionate rate of detentions for Black men under the Mental Health Act and calling for reform before many in the sector understood the scale and impact of the problem. As vice-chair of the independent Mental Health Taskforce, set up in 2015, Jacqui was essential in laying the path for unprecedented increases in investment in mental health through the mental health long-term plan, as well as a series of recommendations to transform mental health services. Jacqui is also the Mental Health Equalities Advisor for NHSE, and has led on the Advancing Mental Health Equalities Strategy and the development of the Patient & Carer Race Equality Framework – a ground-breaking approach to equipping the NHS to address racial disparities in mental health. Jacqui is also a politician, serving as councillor and cabinet member in Lambeth and a social entrepreneur and activist, co-founding Black Thrive. It is a community-led initiative to create a more positive story around mental health in the African-Caribbean community and ensure systemic change to create more responsive, culturally sensitive public services. Meanwhile, in her tenure as Mental Health Foundation President, Jacqui has been responsible for a concerted shift and effort towards becoming an anti-racist organisation and leaves us with this goal as her abiding legacy. Black History Month has given us an opportunity to look back at the pioneers who make our work possible and celebrate those who continue to shape our future. Now, beyond Black History Month, we remain committed to ensuring that all voices are heard and that all those who fight tirelessly for our mental health are recognised.

But while the festive season can be a time of joy and connection – it can sometimes also have the opposite effect – making us feel lonely and disconnected. The pressure to be part of festive fun and feel and act happy can be tough when we feel excluded from it. During the holidays, it can feel like everywhere we look there’s endless festive fun being had by all. We might switch on Netflix for a little escape, but we’re confronted by 10 Christmas family movies. And every advert we see shows families sat around a table wearing Christmas hats and laughing. It can be hard when it feels like everyone is enjoying the time of year, and you’re on the outside.

Many people will be going through the same experiences and find the festive season tough. Here are some things you can try that can help: It can be tough to cope with the pressures and expectations of the holidays. But it can sometimes help to try looking at the festive season from a different perspective. This might be challenging the idea that everyone is having fun and recognising that many people will be facing their own struggles during the festive season. Try to reflect on what you want during the season and focus on the things you can control. It can help to write this down as a list. Connection is important for our mental health. But it does come in different forms. Connection isn’t just about being surrounded by people. We can feel it when we: If we’re struggling with difficult feelings, it can help to open-up to someone. This might be someone you know and trust, or it could be through ahelpline. Kindness and giving back to your community can make us feel good and give us an opportunity to connect with others. Volunteering in your local community can be a great way to do this, and volunteers are often in high demand – particularly during the winter season. There are often opportunities to volunteer on holidays, which can keep you busy, give you a chance to connect with others, and boost your mood. Planning things to look forward is good for your mental health, so try to get a few things in the diary. Doing things you enjoy and are good at can boost your mood and self-esteem. Try to do activities that keep you busy and your mind stimulated. What we enjoy is different for each of us, and that’s okay! If you’re with family or friends over the festive period, and you’re feeling lonely or disconnected, it can help to open-up about it. This can feel really hard, and you may be worried you’ll put a damper on the festivities. But our loved ones want to be there for us and want to help. And chances are, your feelings may resonate with them, too. It can also really help to call ahelpline. Talking to someone you don’t know can sometimes make it easier to talk freely and be honest about our feelings. And they can help you work out what will help you get through it. There are lots of advantages to connecting with people online, if we do it safely. Have you got any particular interests or hobbies? Try searching for online communities where people connect to talk about it. You might just enjoy reading the discussions, or you may want to join in.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/financial-distress-and-anxiety-during-holidays,Financial distress and anxiety during the holidays,"Location:England No matter what we feel is important at this time of year, it’s hard to escape the feeling that the holidays often means spending more money than we usually would. Whether it's gifts, travel or social events, it can be tough to get through December if your finances are tight, particularly for those of us with children with their own expectations. For some of us, the challenge of balancing your finances with the holidays can be stressful or cause anxiety. This can worsen the stresses that some of us feel every day about our bills. And it can feel like everywhere we look, there’s a reminder or an expectation to spend. But it doesn’t have to feel this way – you can still enjoy the holidays without dwelling on these sorts of feelings. Budgeting is helpful all year round and can give us a real sense of control over our finances. It’s almost always the first step financial experts recommend if we’re stressed over our finances. Budgeting is especially useful at Christmas, when there might be extra costs we don’t know whether we can afford. Having a realistic idea about upcoming income and outgoings over the festive season can also help to get a perspective on our finances, and help us plan what we can afford to spend. Try writing everything down to get a true picture of where you are with things. It’ll be better than trying to remember everything, and it’s helpful to see it all organised on paper. There’ssome great advice from organisations like Citizens Adviceabout how to fill out a budget. Essentially it comes down to totting up your income, then subtracting all essential costs for the month, such as bills, debts to pay and groceries, and finally looking at what’s left over to spend on other things, such as presents. You could also try using a budgeting app to help get a better idea of your finances. There are lots of these available for free from your app provider. Just search for 'budgeting apps'. We often think of gifts as expensive things we buy from shops to give to one another. But that’s not the only way we can make our loved ones feel appreciated this Christmas. If your budget doesn’t allow for big spending, why not consider gifting someone your time or an experience you could share? For example, you might promise to walk their dog once a month, give them a ‘voucher’ for a couple of hours of babysitting, or take on the morning cup of tea making duties for your partner. Or if there’s something you know they love doing, why not try to organise something? You might give your teen a movie night at home with them, watching their favourite film together with some snacks, or arrange to have your friend around for a board game evening you host. If you’ve got a special skill – maybe you play guitar, or you know your way around a yoga mat – you can gift someone your time to help them learn. You could even spread the love – how about promising to try to tick off as many of our50 random acts of kindnessas you can alongside a loved one? Spending time with loved ones is an important part of the festive season, and it can be beneficial for our mental health too. So, you might even find these sorts of presents help you both feel better than traditional gifts. Food for special occasions can be expensive, particularly if you’re hosting for everyone. It can be a real cause of anxiety and stress just pulling everything together – but when we’re anxious about money, that worry is doubled. That doesn’t mean you have to miss out on a special time sat around a table with everyone. Firstly, just because it’s the holidays doesn’t mean you have to shop in more expensive places than you’d usually do. If you use a cheaper supermarket, they might have some great deals on holiday food. Shop around – you might find that different supermarkets have deals on different things. It can also be cheaper to buy your Christmas food early, if you have the freezer space to keep it to the day. There are also some great guides online to cooking for Christmas on a budget,like this one from BBC Good Food. Sometimes all it takes is a bit of creativity – and who knows, you might find a new favourite dish! If you’re hosting for people, ask everyone to bring a dish along. This can reduce the financial burden (as well as the stresses of cooking) you might be taking on. If you want to make it part of the celebrations, you could help your friends and family prepare their dishes in the run up to your dinner. Finally, if things are really difficult for you, and you’re struggling to afford even the essentials, the Trussell Trust are here to help. They canhelp you find your local foodbankorprovide advice via their helpline. At this time of year, you might even find your local foodbank has some Christmas items they can help you with.  It’s important to remember when you’re experiencing financial anxiety that you’re not alone in this. The past few years have been tough for lots of us, and money worries have become more common. But this also means that people are becoming more understanding of when things are a struggle for us financially – which is why it’s so important that, when we feel able to, we’re open and honest about the financial situations we’re in. For example, if you and a friend usually exchange gifts, but you don’t think you can afford it this year and are worried what they’ll think, talk to them about it. A friend wouldn’t want you to be spending money you can’t afford, and they definitely won’t want you to be worrying about them. And who knows – maybe your friend is struggling too, and taking the pressure off them as well is the best gift you can give. It can be particularly difficult to have these conversations with children. They might not understand the financial situation your household is in, or you might be worried about them becoming anxious about the family finances. There are somehelpful guides out there from organisations like StepChangeabout how to have these conversations. And if your situation is taking its toll on your mental health, remember that support is out there. Talk to someone you trust, whether that’s a friend, relative, or someone supporting you with your mental health.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/new-years-resolutions-getting-mentally-healthy-start-2025,New Year’s resolutions: getting a mentally healthy start to 2025,"Location:England For many of us, the start of a new year means self-improvement and the promise of, ‘new year, new me’.  This mindset often fuels our New Year’s resolutions. This can help us stay motivated during January, which can be a tough month following the holidays, with spring still feeling far away. But the expectations and pressure we put on ourselves aren’t always helpful. Aiming to be our ‘best selves’ can put us under unnecessary pressure and stress. And when we struggle to live up to the impossible standards we set, it can make us feel guilty and bad about ourselves.  Or we might push ourselves too hard and find that we’re burnt out before the first month is over. Approached with care and a healthy mindset, resolutions can be helpful motivators and have a positive impact. Some people find setting resolutions helpful for their mental health, and others don’t. Before setting any goals for the new year, think about whether this is a helpful motivator – or pressure you just don’t need. It’s okay to decide that New Year’s resolutions aren’t for you. You don’t need a list to tell you who you are, or what you’re capable of. While you’re focusing on the here and now, why not take a look at thethings can that boost your mental health? If you’d like to make some mentally healthy New Year’s resolutions – read on! Many of us make ‘negative’ resolutions – such as stopping eating sweets or spending less money. There’s nothing wrong with stopping things that aren’t good for us – this can be a healthy choice. But it’s important to be cautious about making strict resolutions with no flexibility. One mistake and we may feel like we’ve failed. And while we might try again, we may also abandon the resolution altogether. It can help to re-frame your resolutions in a positive and flexible way. For example, “I will eat healthier”, instead of, “I will stop eating unhealthy food”. We all experience the ups and downs of everyday life. We might have a hard week, or month. We might have a busy period, become unwell, or handle any number of life’s challenges. So, when you’re making resolutions, it can help to make them flexible to respond to real life. You could start small and revisit them each month. For example, if you want to read more, you could start with a resolution to simply start a book. Or if you feel you don’t have enough time to read, you could listen to an audio book or podcast. You could also write them flexibly and plan for when it’ll be hard to keep them up. For example, if your resolution is to exercise more, you could say, when I’m busy or not feeling well, I’ll aim to do 10 minutes of gentle movement. We can often be our own worse critics. And when we don’t meet our own goals, we can be hard on ourselves – and judge ourselves a lot harder than we would others. Try to apply the same kindness you’d give to a friend to yourself. If a friend didn’t achieve a goal they set, what would we say to them? Most likely, it would be something kind and supportive. If you’re struggling to fulfil your resolutions, or you realise that one or two just don’t work for you – try to practice self-kindness. Remember, trying your best can look different each day. And recognising when something isn’t working for you and responding to your needs is something to be proud of. One of the reasons why resolutions can negatively affect our mental health is because of how we think about success and failure. When we set a rigid goal, success and failure can feel black and white. We either met our goal of saving £100 a month, or we didn’t. We either only ate healthy food, or we failed. But this way of setting goals doesn’t account for the ups and downs of life and the different ways we learn, grow, and adapt. When we think of failure as bad and avoid it, we miss out on what we can learn by making mistakes. But if we re-frame what we see as “failure”, we can see it as an opportunity to learn – and as something that can contribute to us succeeding. So, as you’re setting your goals, try to make space for flexibility and the possibility of ‘failing’, and learning from this journey. Not sure where to start? Here are some suggestions for mentally healthy resolutions. Trying new experiences that are outside of your comfort zone can be good for your mental health. Life can feel more interesting, lively and rewarding when we are open to trying new experiences and experimenting with how we do things. You could make an open resolution around trying new things or changing the way you do something. Or you could make more specific goals – like trying different routes to walk your dog. Remember, the important thing is being open and giving it a go – so celebrate this! Spending more time in nature is a great way to boost your mental health. Think about making a resolution that will get you out in nature or even bringing nature into your home. Read our tips Regular movement is important for our mental health. Even short bursts of movement can boost our mood, mental alertness and energy. Gym memberships or fitness classes work for some, and not others. And you may already have a hobby that gets you moving. But if not, then it can help to start by setting small, achievable goals that fit with your lifestyle.  Read our tips Making plans for things we enjoy can increase our sense of hope, which is important for our mental health. Having things to look forward to can also help us cope with difficult situations. Small or big, why not make a resolution to make regular plans to do things you enjoy? We all benefit from kindness, whether we’re giving or receiving it. It can boost our mood, strengthen our connections, and even help us cope better with stress. Think about making a resolution around being kind. This might be to try volunteering, help out a friend or neighbour, or do random acts of kindness.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/why-community-important-our-mental-health-and-wellbeing,Why is community important for our mental health and wellbeing?,"Location:England, Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland We're proud to be the home of Mental Health Awareness Week and gladly accept the responsibility of choosing a theme and running the campaign every year. We take great care to select a topic that people from all over the UK can relate to and will make them want to get involved in conversations and activities to promote good mental health. This year, we're delighted to focus on the theme of ‘Community’. Already we’ve been hearing from people and organisations who are excited about the theme and stories about their own communities.We hope this year’s campaign will be the biggest and best yet. At the Mental Health Foundation we are committed to creating a world where there is good mental health for all. We do this by focusing on preventing poor mental health alongside building and protecting good mental health. We know that being part of a community is vital for our mental health and wellbeing. We thrive when we have strong connections with others and supportive communities around us. We also know that people who are more socially connected to family, friends, or their community are happier, physically healthier, and live longer, with fewer mental health problems than people who are less well connected. Communities can provide us with a sense of belonging, safety, support in hard times, and give us purpose. So, this Mental Health Awareness Week we want to celebrate the communities that support us to protect and nurture good mental health. There are many different types of community, and you can belong to more than one. A community is a group of people brought together through something which they share in common. It can be found with either the people who live around us in a geographic location or with people we connect with through similar values and interests. You might find your community at school or work, through your faith, at a club where you enjoy a hobby, as part of a group inspiring action for positive change, an online game, or even through a love of Taylor Swift. Importantly, a community should make you feel good about yourself, feel safe, and feel empathy towards others. A community is there to help you through the hard times such as illness, bereavement, or natural disasters. Throughout covid we saw so many examples of communities coming together to support one another, find joy, and ensure that those most in need were looked after. Of course, not all communities are safe or healthy. If a community makes you think badly of yourself, encourages hateful or discriminatory actions towards others, or puts you in danger, it will be damaging to your mental health and wellbeing. Throughout the week we’ll also be talking about how to recognise and protect yourself and loved ones from harmful spaces. We will be providing expert information and guidance on how community supports good mental health, providing ideas for how to cultivate mentally healthy communities, sharing inspiring stories from communities across the UK, and encouraging people and organisations to get involved with activities and events. We hope that you’ll get involved.  Please keep an eye on our website for further updates, information and campaign materials. Or sign up to our mailing list.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/you-cant-pour-empty-cup-value-community-parent-mental-health,You can’t pour from an empty cup: the value of community for parent mental health,"Location:England, Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland Parent Mental Health Day is held on30th January, with the theme Creating Positive Connections. To mark the day Gillian Meens, manager of the Small Talk programme for lone parents shares her own experience of the necessity of community for parents and how peer support can make the world of difference. I love being a mum, I love my kids but almost nothing else has tested my mental health in the same way. After years of working in self-management and wellbeing support, I thought I had patience, I thought I had resilience, I thought I knew how to look after myself… It turns out having children was where I found the end of my own resilience and the beginning of a new type of solidarity and support that I hadn’t experienced before. When my eldest was born, I’d had a difficult pregnancy and a traumatic birth experience followed by feeding issues caused by tongue tie. Then, when he was a few months old, my son’s ‘harmless’ hemangioma (birth mark) on his head blistered and burst which resulted in a hospital stay in a burns ward. Meanwhile, I was moving through the motions, exhausted and detached from everything. I knew parenthood was going to be hard, but I didn’t realise it was going to bethishard. Three stories stick out to me of how my friends and community had my back. A few weeks in, we were struggling. My son wasn’t feeding well, I was struggling with recovery and we felt like we were falling apart. My friend messaged and asked if she could come around and help. It was genuine. Not a ‘can I come around and help’ but really ‘can I come cuddle your baby while you run around cleaning up and bringing me cups of tea’. All well intended, but a lot of guests had looked like the latter. I asked her if she would help clean the house for me. A simple request, but I found my anxious energy was being directed into that and I knew it wasn’t helping me recover or establish feeding with my baby. I remember she came around, chatted with me for a bit and then cleaned. She did the dishes, she cleaned our bathroom and let me rest and just be. I cried with gratitude. A little while later, I was due to come to a newly found mum friend’s house for both of us to get our hair cut by another of our ‘First Steps’ mums who was building up her home hair cutting service. For context, the First Steps groups were set up by our local health visitors for mums to come to a weekly class together when babies were around 8-10 weeks for around 4 weeks, I honestly can’t remember much about what they taught us but I do remember the friends I made there. Back to the story…When I got to the house, I was late, like really, late. The hairdresser had left by time I turned up. I can’t even remember what that morning looked like. Much of that time is a blur. But when I arrived and realised I had let someone down and missed out on something remotely resembling self-care, I broke down. My mum friend – on her third child and who had likely seen it all before - gently took me and my little one into her house. Let him play, made me a green tea and had a chat, then sent me home with some homemade curry. It was simple but it was healing. I can’t remember that morning, but I can remember how her care made me feel. Fast forward a few years and baby no.2 arrived. We found out we were pregnant just as covid lockdown was announced in March 2020. I remember thinking, ‘great I won’t have to hide my nausea and fatigue from everyone’. In reality, almost no one, other than the midwives and my neighbours at our weekly ‘clap for the NHS’, saw my bump at all. This time, no major complications with birth or feeding and no visitors either. This time, the loneliness and detachment were of a different kind. I had a toddler at home, worries of the impact of covid during pregnancy, on our hospital visits, and with a tiny baby. Constant testing, changes in rules, no visitors to help but once again, I had some truly magnificent people who stepped in. We had friends from our church who dropped meals at our door for the first few weeks. And the relief of not having to make meals for 3 hungry mouths was immense. They also dropped in toys & magazines for my oldest, probably recognising the challenge of keeping him happy and entertained when almost everything was closed. It made me feel a sense of connection and support when I felt distant and without the face-to-face support of friends like the last time. Once again, the ‘First Steps’ group were a lifeline, though this time, all online. Very quickly we became a group that was less about the babies and more about looking out for one another. When we could, we met for walks with the prams and coffees in the park despite it being freezing. Those chats kept me sane. The WhatsApp group became a place of solidarity and support in place of health visitors, baby groups and face-to-face chats at playgroups. I look back and recognise now that with both my boys, I likely experienced post-natal depression and anxiety. The thing is, I didn’t realise it, or if I did, I certainly didn’t want to admit it to myself or anyone else. As I reflected on it, I think I thought that if I was to admit it, it would mean I had ‘failed’. I had failed at what should be natural. Part of the picture, I think, was that as someone with a tendency to ‘type A’ I struggled to compute that I couldn’t do this, or do it well. Or to put it another way, I was attempting to ‘get it right’ all the time, while it was something you can’t healthily approach this way. I had failed. I had failed at something which wasn’t a test, and the stress and anxiety that brought was crushing at times. The thing that brought me back to reality though was speaking to other mums. They helped put into perspective the realities of life with a little one and brought me back many times from spiraling. And as I came out of the fog of little babies and determined toddlers, the fog of anxiety lifted too. I started at the Mental Health Foundation 3 years ago, bringing my background in wellbeing and family work together with my personal experience as a mum of two. I was tasked with looking at support needs for lone parents, for a now well-established project called “Small Talk”. As I worked with other organisations to look at the needs of lone parents in the perinatal period (pregnancy and the early years), peer support came up,a lot. I recognised then, just how fortunate I had been and that many parents don’t have access to, or feel able to access, the support that I had from other people going through similar experiences to me. This paired with my own experiences of care and support from groups of other parents, made me really passionate about working together to ensure all parents could get the kind of support that I did. Accessing groups not only made for good experiences for me and my baby but where those groups fostered relationships with others, they also became places of precious knowledge and care. Without a doubt peer support has supported me and countless others but in an unequal society, we have unequal levels of support as well as the many types of stigma which make it so hard to open up and find support when it’s needed. Having a baby can be a really isolating experience (even with a support network) and we can feel we have to figure it all out ourselves but thankfully, we don’t. I hope by supporting organisations to create more spaces for peer support with theSmall Talk framework, new parents just might find that so many others are struggling with exactly the same things they are. I don’t know how things would have looked for me without the support of other parents and my friends and family but I certainly know I was better for it. When my cup was empty, others helped me fill it up.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/journey-safety-struggles-lgbt-asylum-seekers-and-refugees,The journey to safety: the struggles of LGBT+ asylum seekers and refugees,"Location:United Kingdom, England, Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland Imagine fleeing your home because of who you are and who you love, only to face even more hurdles when you finally reach safety. This LGBT History Month, as we reflect on the theme of Activism and Social Change, it’s important to recognise the experiences of LGBT+ asylum seekers and refugees, and the work being done to create a more humane and inclusive asylum system. Their stories are not just about survival but also about resilience and the ongoing fight for dignity and acceptance in the face of systemic challenges. Despite the many stories of progress across the world, being LGBT+ is still extremely dangerous in far too many places. In around60 countries, same-sex relationships are criminalised, and in some, simply being LGBT+ can result in imprisonment or even the death penalty. Many of these laws have roots in British colonial history. Overhalf of the countriesthat criminalise LGBT+ people today can trace their laws back to Britain - whether as a former colony, a ‘protectorate’, or through another historical relationship. While the UK has come a long way since this dark period in promoting LGBT+ rights, the legacy of its laws still influences too many countries to this day. Another major source of criminalisation comes from the strict interpretation of Islamic law, with some of the harshestpenalties found in Muslim-majority countries.Together, these laws create a hostile environment where countless LGBT+ people are forced to hide who they are, live in fear, or risk their lives simply for existing. For many, fleeing their home country is the only option for survival. Many of those who flee choose the UK, a country widely seen as a global leader in LGBT+ rights, as their place of refuge. However, although in many ways the UK is a safe haven for LGBT+ people, its asylum system provides a much less rosy picture. For many seeking refuge, arriving in the UK is just the beginning. Instead of finding immediate safety, LGBT+ asylum seekers are often met with new barriers, challenges and even more trauma. Let’s imagine you’ve finally escaped your country. After a gruelling and often traumatic journey you have managed to arrive in the UK safely. You might feel both exhausted by the journey and what you’ve endured but also feel an unmistakable sense of relief. But that relief quickly fades once you find yourself sitting across from a Home Office asylum officer, being asked odd and inappropriate questions about your sex life or even hearing them say that you don’t even look gay or transgender. This isn’t just hypothetical. Over the last decade, many LGBT+ asylum seekers have had such shocking experiences. From intrusive questions to insensitive treatment, the asylum system can feel more like another hurdle than a safe haven.1Many LGBT+ asylum seekers are sometimes required to ‘prove’ their sexual orientation or gender identity in legal contexts such as Home Office interviews that may lack understanding or empathy. This process can be distressing for the individual and the ‘proof’ needed also often relies on Western conceptions of sexuality and expectations of LGBT+ lifestyles which can be highly stereotypical.2 Types of evidence such as public displays of affection, social media posts and photos with partners - things that might seem normal for people in the UK - are naturally hard to come by for those fleeing persecution. In many countries, having such evidence could mean imprisonment or even death. While the Home Office has since provided guidelines to prevent the use of such inappropriate and invasive questions, the impact of this legacy lingers. For many LGBT+ asylum seekers, the asylum process continues to be not just about proving their identity but confronting the fear that they won’t be believed. One of our Young Leaders voiced their anxiety about engaging with the Home Office because of their sexuality: ""For a long time I did not disclose my sexuality to the Home Office because of the fear and anxiety of having to prove my sexuality during the process."" Furthermore, the asylum process can also risk retraumatisation for these individuals. Being forced to recount traumatic experiences over and over isn’t just exhausting—it can reopen old wounds and leave lasting scars. This can intensify ongoing mental health challenges, which are only worsened by the lack of transparency and long waiting times for their asylum claim to be processed.3 Even after passing the initial screening interviews and being placed in asylum accommodation, many LGBT+ asylum seekers continue to face threats of abuse and discrimination - in many cases from the people they live alongside. Wider research has documented verbal and physical harassment in asylum accommodation, where LGBT+ individuals are housed with people from the same regions they fled.4 In detention facilities, the situation can be even worse. LGBT+ asylum seekers have reported experiencing discrimination and harassment both from other detainees and from members of staff. These hostile environments lead to severe anxiety, depression, self-harm and even suicide attempts.5 Now you’ve gone through the gruelling and traumatic asylum process and finally received your refugee status. But suddenly, a large wave of new questions hits you. What now? How do I get a job? Will I be discriminated against because of my sexuality, gender identity or even just because of my skin colour or where I come from? After all the trauma and mental health challenges that I’ve experienced, is there a safe space where I can just…be? After officially becoming refugees, many LGBT+ individuals find it very difficult to rebuild their lives and settle into society. The experiences of detention, retraumatisation, discrimination and abuse don’t just fade away and often leave lasting scars. Many continue to struggle with severe mental health issues, isolation, and further discrimination within British society. LGBT+ refugees often face multiple layers of stigma, including xenophobia, racism, homophobia, and transphobia. This intersectionality leads to discrimination in crucial areas such as housing, employment, healthcare, and other essential services, further exacerbating feelings of worthlessness, anxiety, and depression.6 Research by Micro Rainbow International found that in a sample of 50 refugees who identified as lesbian or gay, 86% felt they had been discriminated against because of their sexual orientation, not just in their country of origin but in the UK too. Even in job interviews, some refugees have been inappropriately asked questions regarding their sexuality, reflecting a systemic pattern of bias and misunderstanding.7 Additionally, many LGBT+ refugees feel excluded from their ethnic communities while also struggling to access local LGBT+ networks.8Micro Rainbow International also found that 36% of respondents avoided socialising with co-nationals in the UK, unless they were also LGBT+, fearing the same prejudice they faced in their home countries. This kind of social isolation makes it even harder to feel a sense of belonging in their new country.9 But there is hope. Many organisations across the UK such asRainbow Migration,Micro Rainbow,African Rainbow Familyand many more provide vital support to LGBT+ refugees and asylum seekers. These organisations work tirelessly to advocate for a more humane and inclusive asylum system while offering community spaces where refugees can build supportive relationships, find a sense of belonging and successfully rebuild their lives in the UK. On a policy level, the current Labour government's commitment to a comprehensive reform of the asylum system and its subsequentabandonment of the Rwanda asylum planpresents a timely opportunity to reinvigorate engagement and advocacy for an asylum system that is more efficient and humane. The Rwanda plan posed significant risks to LGBT+ asylum seekers, as it could have resulted in people being sent to a country whereLGBT+ rights are not fully protectedand where discrimination and persecution remain serious concerns. Its cancellation offers a critical window to ensure that future policies reflect the progressive values of inclusion, compassion, and dignity, particularly for vulnerable groups like LGBT+ refugees. We need to do better. If the UK wants to reclaim its reputation as a leader in LGBT+ rights, we must create systems that don’t retraumatise those seeking safety but instead offer the support, dignity and compassion they deserve. This LGBT History Month, let’s not only celebrate how far we’ve come but also commit to making the asylum system safer for those still seeking refuge. Some of the many things you can do to make a difference include: Resources to support refugees and asylum seekers with their mental health, including advice translated into other languages.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/self-harm-and-recovery-lets-talk-about-it,Self-harm and recovery: let's talk about it,"Location:United Kingdom, England, Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland The first of March is Self-Injury Awareness Day, a day for breaking down stereotypes and sharing messages of support for people who self-harm. “Self-harm"" can mean different things to different people. Here, we are using the word “self-harm” to mean any behaviour that injures your body on purpose, without meaning to end your life. This is also called “non-suicidal self-injury"". The first thing to know is that self-harm is common – around 20% of young people and 5% of adults have self-harmed1. If you self-harm, you are not alone. And even if you haven't self-harmed yourself, you probably know someone who has. This means it’s everyone’s business to understand self-harm. People self-harm because it helps them cope in some way. Some people self-harm to release tension, express anger, or cope with emotional pain. Some people self-harm to stay grounded when they are feeling emotionally numb or disconnected from their bodies. Some people feel that they are bad inside or deserve punishment, and self-harm becomes a way of expressing these negative feelings towards themselves. For some people, self-harm helps them stay alive when things feel unbearable. Whatever the reason, self-harm is a sign that someone is struggling and in need of support. Once someone has started self-harming, it can become difficult to stop. The urge to self-harm can be very strong and hard to ignore. This makes it difficult to use other coping strategies in the moment. Self-harm can feel like an addiction for some people. It can become part of a daily routine or turn into a habit that is hard to break. Researchers don’t know exactly why this is, but the biological effects of self-harm are probably part of the explanation. When we are injured, our bodies release chemicals called “endogenous opioids” which are natural pain killers. These chemicals affect our bodies in a similar way to other opioid drugs, like morphine, which can explain why some people don’t feel any pain while they are self-harming. Once someone starts experiencing the emotional and physical relief brought on by these natural pain killers, this can drive them to self-harm more2. It can feel confusing or scary to want to stop self-harming, while also finding it hard to give up. If you are experiencing this, know that this is something many other people have struggled with, and there is support available for you. Recovery from self-harm is a personal journey and everyone will have their own definition of what this means for them3. In general, it involves looking after your physical and emotional wellbeing so you can live the life you want. We understand it’s not as simple as “just stopping” and there may be setbacks along the way. Some people go a long time without self-harming, then find themselves back in the habit during a particularly difficult time. Some people keep feeling strong urges even after they’ve stopped self-harming. This is all normal. It might be a process of trial and error to find the strategies that work for you. Recovery isn’t easy, but things usually get easier with time. The most important thing is not to give up – you can recover and live a life free from self-harm. It’s important to reach out for professional support if you are struggling to stop self-harming. Alongside this, these tips can help: It can also be reassuring to know that, for many young people, self-harm will get better or stop completely as they get older. Adults say that developing self-compassion, learning more about self-harm, finding new coping strategies, strengthening their social support networks, and leaving stressful environments (like leaving school and moving away from home) were important to their self-harm recovery journey4.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/advice-parents-worried-about-issues-raised-netflixs-show-adolescence,Advice for parents worried about issues raised in Netflix's show Adolescence,"Location:United Kingdom, England, Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland Stephen Graham and Jack Thorne’s Netflix drama Adolescence has captured the country’s attention, both for the quality of the drama and the light it shines on the issues facing young people today, which can affect their mental health in new and complex ways. Many parents may be shocked at the portrayal of teenagers’ online life and the distress it can cause. If you are worried about your child, we have set out some thoughts and advice below. It’s important to remember that online communities, like those in real life, can be incredibly supportive places. Supportive communities can offer a sense of safety and connection, reduce isolation, and give a sense of purpose. Online communities have the advantage of connecting people with shared interests or experiences who might be geographically distant, and many people find it easier to express themselves online. Not having to use your own identity or name can encourage more honest self-disclosure than conversations in-person, which can be particularly helpful for marginalised groups such as LGBTQ+ young people. Not all online communities are healthy, as Adolescence shows to devastating effect. While digital communities lower the bar to expression, this can also lead to a culture of bullying and toxicity which young people have no respite from in an ‘always on’ culture. In particular, Adolescence highlights the toxicity of the manosphere, where misogyny flourishes. This ranges from regressive and wrong attitudes around gender all the way through to extreme misogyny on incel and related forums. Most people, thankfully, have never visited these sites; but to give you a flavour of their content, aCentre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) reportfound that the members of one incel forum post about rape once every 29 minutes. While the very hateful sites might only be populated by a few thousand users, their influence has spread to common parts of the internet. They normalise behaviours that are damaging both to the mental health of members and those affected by their behaviour. And conversely there is a clear path where from seemingly innocent content young people start by engaging with such as fitness and gym material to more sinister content based on hatred for women, LGBTQ+ people, and people of colour. While the pathways are driven in part by algorithms, young men are also cynically manipulated by linked sites that work together. As a parent of two teenagers, I know we can feel scared and helpless to advise our children how to navigate through the online world. But there are things we can do. Firstly, know what’s out there. Whilst I definitely wouldn’t encourage anyone to search out hateful sites on the internet, CCDH has a usefulglossary of terms(like incel, bluepill, chad, looksmaxxing) which can help understanding of the cultures online. And knowing about the most common platforms and understanding how your children engage with them (e.g. passively observing or actively posting) is a good place to start. Next, talk to your kids about what they are engaging with online and how it makes them feel.  Be curious about what your children enjoy about the sites and forums they visit. Encourage them to reflect on whether the communities they are part of feel healthy, or the opposite. Mental Health America has agreat resourcewhich suggests a healthy online community should make someone feel safe, hold everyone accountable, be a space where you feel connected to others, align with your values a person, and not drain you or make you feel bad about yourself. Encourage your child to keep reviewing whether what they are engaging with online still feels right for them, because communities change over time. Talk to your children as well about age appropriate guidelines and help them understand how they can change algorithm ‘bubbles’ if they feel they are seeing too much of a particular kind of content. Algorithms will push content they think we want to see – but it’s important for everyone to block, mute, unfollow, and report content that makes you feel uncomfortable.  We have published more general advice on our website about talking to your children about healthy internet use. Currently, materials and training given to teachers, and the nature of online safety education as a part of Personal, Social, Health and Economic (PSHE) education, is failing our schools and our children, leading to devastating mental health impacts. Teaching about online communities and online safety more broadly should be a statutory requirement for schools. Schools must upskill both teachers and children so that relevant, meaningful and age-appropriate discussion can happen in the classroom. In addition, we know that a ‘whole-school’ approach is the most effective way to protect and support the mental health of young people and teachers. It’s not enough to have discrete PSHE classes or pastoral care session if the rest of the school structure is blind to the pressures children are under, or if bullying and discrimination go unchallenged.  Regular tracking of pupil and teacher’s mental wellbeing  in schools would give vital information to understand trends and where action is needed. There is a growing movement to ban mobile phones from schools. We agree that currently smart phones simply are not safe for kids. However, banning them in schools would only solve one small part of the problem. We need to give young people the skills and confidence to navigate the internet safely and to recognise harmful cultures when they see it. And we need the government to ensure the most harmful content is properly regulated and removed – something they are shying away from doing in their lacklustre implementation of the Online Safety Act. Adolescence is one of those great pieces of TV that engages people for its own sake but also drives a national debate about important issues. There are few issues more important than the safety and mental health of our children and young people. Let’s make sure this discussion leads to much needed action and meaningful change.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/how-does-community-support-parents-mental-health,How does community support parents’ mental health?,"Location:United Kingdom, England, Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland Community plays an important role in protecting parents’ mental health. Being a parent comes with many ups and downs, joys and challenges, which can affect your mental health and wellbeing. For parents at greater risk for mental health problems, such as those experiencing poverty, single parents, young parents, and those with a long-term condition, or caring for a child with one, it’s especially important to protect your mental health. Many of us will have heard the saying, “it takes a village”, when it comes to parenting. Our families and friends can provide us with support and community. But this isn’t guaranteed for everyone. Not all of us have supportive family or friends, or people we can turn to, for many different reasons. And sometimes, those close to us don’t always understand our experiences as parents. That’s where peer support groups come in. Peer support is central to our work with parents and families, and for good reason. Connecting people with shared experiences can give a unique sense of understanding and belonging that we need as parents. These groups can offer a positive community that promotes connection, provides support, and a feeling of being seen and heard, while reducing loneliness and isolation. We asked members of ourParent Champion Group– a peer support group for parents – how this community helps their mental health. For a lot of parents, just at the point where you need community the most – it can sometimes get smaller. Maintaining connections is important, and why peer support groups can make such a difference. The members also shared the following ways that the Parent Champion Group has helped them: Our programmes run across the UK. Created for specific groups such as single parents and families, they bring people together to share their challenges and their knowledge, and to find the confidence and develop the tools to transform their experiences and grow their communities. Project Manager, Nadine Rose, shares: ""What people need is a safe place to go, the chance to open-up about how difficult they are finding things, and access to resources that protect their mental health. That’s why it’s so important to have these peer support programmes, so people can connect with one another and find new ways to cope. ""While bringing people together may sound like a small thing, in reality, it’s massive. ""People who’ve been in a very dark place tell us it’s like getting themselves back, And that’s really powerful.""

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/supporting-refugees-and-asylum-seekers,Supporting refugees and asylum seekers,"Location:United Kingdom, England, Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland Our sense of community often begins in the neighbourhoods we grow up in—places where we feel secure, connected, and able to thrive. If we’re lucky, this means access to safe spaces, education, employment, and opportunities to socialise freely. However, not all of us are able to stay in the place we call home. Fleeing one's home country is a decision which no one makes lightly. For asylum seekers and refugees, it is often forced by violence, persecution, or war within their communities—circumstances that leave lasting scars, both physically and mentally. Trauma from these experiences significantly impacts mental health, putting individuals at a higher risk of developing long-term challenges. While seeking sanctuary in a safe country like the UK can mark the beginning of a fresh start, the reality is far from simple. The journey is fraught with uncertainty—awaiting Home Office decisions, coping with frequent relocations, the threat of detention or deportation, financial struggles with no right to work, and experiencing racism and discrimination. All of these factors compound the mental health challenges faced by asylum seekers, making it harder for them to heal and integrate into new communities. A stable and inclusive community is vital for mental wellbeing. Yet, constant upheaval and uncertainty often prevents asylum seekers and refugees from laying down roots and reaping the benefits of belonging to a safe, welcoming environment. Recognising this, the Mental Health Foundation has developed initiatives to support asylum seekers and refugees in looking after their mental health and contributing meaningfully to their new communities, providing a sense of belonging and purpose. At the Mental Health Foundation, we understand the positive impact that community connections can have on mental health. That's why many of our projects focus on bringing people together to share, collaborate, and create. Art and creativity often play a key role in our projects, offering individuals a way to process emotions and share their experiences in powerful, transformative ways. Projects likeElevateandOur Powerhave not only fostered connection but also led to in inspiring exhibitions at prestigious art galleries in Glasgow. Other projects have included producing podcasts, writing workshops, and even the creation of a comic book. ForMental Health Awareness Week, a group of women came together at Glasgow’s Gallery of Modern Art (GoMA) for an art workshop where they crafted artworks that celebrate the power of community and what it means to them. Their creations, inspired by collaboration and mutual encouragement, are now featured on postcards and tote bags available in our shop to raise money for the Mental Health Foundation’s work. Watch our video showcasing the ‘Community’ art workshop. The challenges of seeking asylum do not end when people reach the safety of the UK. People can be retraumatised through their post-migration experiences as they navigate harsh Home Office processes and contend with repeated setbacks and barriers. That’s why projects such as those run by Mental Health Foundation to support people to be included in their new communities and protect their mental health are so important. We've created some limited-edition products based on the designs created by ou programme participants in the workshop at Glasgow’s Gallery of Modern Art. Check them out and order below.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/finding-safe-and-supportive-communities-trans-or-non-binary-person,Finding safe and supportive communities as a trans or non-binary person,"For transgender and non-binary people in the UK, supportive communities can enable our survival. As a trans person living in Scotland, the recent increase in and acceptability of transphobia in the UK has been frightening. Like everyone, trans and non-binary people need communities where we can be ourselves, feel supported, support others and work towards shared goals. Transgender and non-binary people already face significant discrimination globally and in the UK. And transphobia has only increased in recent years1following opposition to the reform of the Gender Recognition Act and the demonisation of trans women by politicians, hate groups and in the media. It is no surprise therefore that trans and non-binary people are more likely to experience mental health issues, suicidal ideation and to die by suicide than cisgender people.2 We face discrimination in our everyday lives and hostility to trans lives is hard to escape. When you simply go to the shops, the newspaper headlines are full of portrayals of trans people (particularly trans women) as deceptive and predatory, with any bad actions by individuals generalised to portray all trans people as dangerous. Going to the bathroom or walking down the street involves the fear and often reality that you will be verbally or physically abused. Research by Scottish Trans in 20243found trans and non-binary people were less likely to positively rate their neighbourhood compared to the general population with over 60% avoiding at least one public service due to fear of being outed or harassed due to being trans. Fear unfortunately can be a daily reality of being trans. This has only intensified following the recent Supreme Court decision4, where despite no trans people being heard by the court, it was unanimously decided that women in the Equality Act (2010) refers exclusively to cisgender (non-transgender) women. Statements by politicians and the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) have only intensified the fear and despair of trans and non-binary people that we will be excluded from the spaces and services that enable us to go about our daily lives. Trans and non-binary people already avoid a lot of public services, especially bathrooms and this ruling and statements by politicians as well as forthcoming EHRC guidance will only make it harder for trans and non-binary people to work, study, volunteer, exercise, socialise and attend appointments. In response trans and non-binary people have organised protests across the UK and we recognise that this attack on our rights will only make women and other marginalised communities less safe alongside trans and non-binary people. Being trans or non-binary is not a mental health condition but facing transphobia in our everyday lives means many of us develop poor mental health. Supportive communities can go some way to meeting the unmet needs of trans and non-binary people. This is particularly the case in trans and non-binary specific communities where peer and social support can be invaluable in enabling our survival. Such communities where trans people can connect with others, learn skills and support each other are necessary when public services and society fail to meet our basic needs. Mutual aid and informal support and volunteering are therefore common in communities of marginalised people such as trans and non-binary people when other services fail to include us or protect us from harm. Trans and non-binary people have always been here and so have trans and non-binary communities, even when wider society has been and continues to be hostile to our existence and participation in everyday life. When we have places whether online or in-person, where we can feel welcome and safe, this can help us process and respond to negative experiences and feel rare validation in a society that is hostile to us. Many trans and non-binary people may be estranged from their families due to transphobia and so forming new connections is even more important. As trans and non-binary people are a relatively small proportion of the population, online spaces from Discord servers to Facebook groups and more can be helpful especially for those in rural locations or in small or unsupportive towns and cities. However, it is important that online communities are properly moderated by those that use them as many social media platforms which (like the legacy media) are already underregulated have further regressed to allow even more transphobic harassment, microaggressions and hate speech. A lot of trans and non-binary people who are already more likely to have low income must choose between transition related costs and buying food and paying bills and unlike transphobic hate groups which are well funded (including by socially conservative organisations in the USA), many organisations that support trans and non-binary people are underfunded. Therefore, practices of mutual aid where trans and non-binary people support each other despite limited resources are vital. Whether this is a community meal, crowdfunding for transition related costs, self and collective advocacy or protesting the erosion of trans rights, it is important that we build communities of self and collective care. This connection and mutual aid can help us respond to the hostility to our lives with hope instead of despair. Supportive communities are essential for maintaining our mental health and wellbeing as well as ever increasing the spaces we don’t have to feel constant anxiety, fear and despair. Where together we can talk, perform, create, take action and even just exist. From local groups to online spaces, sports clubs and community centres - there are lots of ways to connect with other trans and non-binary people.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/how-foster-positive-community-group-settings,How to foster positive community in group settings,"Location:United Kingdom, England, Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland It takes more than simply bringing people together to build a sense of community and belonging within a group. Read our blog to learn about how to foster positive community within groups that supports good mental health. In my six years running groups with asylum seekers and refugees in Wales, I've learnt a lot about how to support individuals to grow their sense of community within their groups. I've seen firsthand how a sense of community can draw together individuals from a wide range of identities, cultures, and across languages. Positive community also helps to build a sense of belonging and purpose, which can support good mental health and wellbeing. As part of theBridges to Belongingproject, we run Community Conversations on mental health for asylum seeking and refugee groups. Through this model, we support community groups to run 8 sessions that discuss mental health, and pair this with a creative or movement-based activity. Each session uses a variety of techniques that builds group member’s sense of shared community. Based on my experience, here are some of those key components to fostering positive community, and some tips of how you might embed these within your groups. Inclusivity is about making everyone feel included. This is fundamental to building positive communities within groups. Everyone in the group can participate fully, and no one feels left out. The group may include individuals from a diverse range of backgrounds, such as having different religions, race, sexuality and gender identity. Without inclusivity, it is impossible to build a sense of community within such diverse groups. Feeling able to take part and be supported by other group members allows individuals to truly engage with a group, and produces a sense of shared community. A key way to ensure inclusivity in group settings is to actively consider the needs of group members, and to be responsive and flexible. This will allow you to ensure that everyone is able to participate. If there are language differences within the group, consider tailoring sessions. For example, if there are some with limited English language, you could consider including more activities that don’t need language, such as art or movement based. It is also important to consider if changes need to be made to accommodate for disabilities. Not all disabilities are visible, so creating an inclusive environment is key to individuals feeling comfortable to disclose these, so that you are able to make any adjustments. To feel able to engage in community, individuals must feel that the group is a safe space where they are able to be open about their identities without any risk. To build this kind of environment, it is crucial to make it clear that intolerance is not accepted and to make it clear that all are welcome, regardless of background. Some groups add a pledge alongside their joining form which all members will read or sign. This could include something even as simple as “I agree to be welcoming to everyone in the group and I am aware that intolerance is not accepted here”. The purpose of this is to not only warn against intolerance, but allows those with marginalised identities to feel protected, and therefore safe to be open within the group. Groups might begin sessions by reminding of this pledge or their ground rules, particularly if there are discussions planned on relevant topics. A crucial way to build community within groups, is ensuring that group members are involved within the group’s design and planning. This is especially important where group members have specific lived experiences, that allow them extra insight into the best ways of shaping the group. Through utilising lived experiences, we ensure that the content of sessions and activities are relevant to group members. When lived experience is not listened to when creating or designing a group and its activities, we risk creating a non-inclusive and non-empowering space, which is out of touch with the life experiences of its members. Using lived experience voices to form groups empowers individuals to design spaces that fit diverse experiences of the world. Healthy communities are inclusive of diverse groups, and therefore lived experience is essential when considering building community in groups. Peer support is a powerful tool to create community through groups. Peer support is when people who have some overlapping experiences support each other. Feeling supported through other group members can create a sense of community, as well as promoting wellbeing. Through our community conversations model, rather than presenting groups with a preset informational slideshow, we encourage our groups to discuss mental health topics. For example, instead of telling groups how to manage anxiety, we might start a discussion on “What tips might you suggest to a friend experiencing anxiety?”. Through questions like this, individuals are encouraged to come up with solutions that work for them, as well as practicing how they might share tips for mental health with the wider community. Friendship and fun are key elements to build community within groups. Looking forward to seeing and spending time together encourages individuals to continue attending the group. Through continued attendance, individuals can grow stronger bonds and trust with other group members. You can build this into your groups by including enjoyable activities that encourage individuals to get to know each other better, or to work together on something creative. In our community conversations sessions, one icebreaker activity we use involves group members not only sharing their name, but sharing the meaning of their name, and who gave it to them. By providing personal stories, group members get to know each other better, and become closer. In our session on social support, we encourage building friendship through doing group art. In our latest session we asked teams of four to create a collage on “What does community mean to you?”. Here are some examples of what our teams created: Positive community brings many mental health benefits, including a sense of belonging, safety and purpose. Whether you’re setting up a new group or already running one, and especially if you’re working with minoritised and marginalised groups, consider how you might embed these principles to help foster positive community. Being part of a community can make life feel more meaningful and enjoyable, help us feel happier and safer, and improve our mental health. Read our 10 tips on how to get involved in your community. Coming together to share, collaborate, and create is a great way of building a sense of community to support the mental health of refugees and asylum seekers taking part in our projects in Scotland.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/without-community-theres-no-mental-health,"Without community, there’s no mental health","Location:United Kingdom, England, Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland A thriving society is built on strong communities: people coming together and offering each other a sense of belonging, safety, and support. This Mental Health Awareness Week, we are celebrating the incredible community organisations across the UK that play a huge role in fostering good mental health. These groups do such vital work, often stepping in where the decline of local industry, years of underinvestment, and rising deprivation have left communities struggling. When communities falter, people feel isolated and unsupported, especially during life’s toughest moments. We’ve seen this erosion fuelled by poverty, inequality and systemic injustices like racism and sexism. The impact is huge - poor mental health is now the largest single contributor to ill-health across the UK. It’s not just about wellbeing; it has economic consequences, too, with economic and social costs of at least £118 billion every year. At the Mental Health Foundation, we are committed to understanding and improving mental health through our research and programmatic work. We focus on preventative approaches, addressing the root causes of mental ill-health and promoting resilience within communities. We particularly work with people at higher risk of developing mental health problems, includingnew parents, young peopleandrefugees and asylum seekers. These programmes often include peer support networks and community-based activities to combat loneliness. We know that programmes like these can create environments where people feel connected, supported, and empowered to maintain good mental health. But we and our colleagues in the sector cannot do it alone. The burden of reversing the effects of poor political planning and decision-making should not fall solely on the shoulders of charities or those who live and work in the communities most affected. We need our governments across the UK to step up and take action to tackle the erosion of our communities and support the public’s mental health. This isn’t something governments can afford to ignore. Investing in communities isn’t just the right thing to do morally - it’s the smart choice, too. It helps address the root causes of poor mental health, like inadequate housing, lack of opportunities, and social inequality. At the Mental Health Foundation, we’ve been calling for a cross-government plan to prevent mental health problems for many years. This was announced – and then dropped again – but the previous government. There is a huge opportunity for the current government to revive this work. Such a plan would look at how every government department can play its part in improving the nation’s mental health, moving to a truly preventative system where parts of government as diverse as Work and Pensions, Education and the Home Office are all thinking about what they can do build a mentally healthy society. A fundamental part of that is building our communities back up. When people have access to community assets like youth clubs and leisure centres; when they live in decent housing with local amenities; when thought has been given to preventing loneliness, people are both healthier and more productive.

Peer support groups can provide people with a community that plays a vital role in improving mental wellbeing, fostering resilience, and enhancing quality of life. Connecting with others that truly understand what you’re going through can be key to navigating the complexities of long-term conditions. Peer support is more than just shared experiences—it's about mutual understanding, encouragement, and empowerment. When people with similar health challenges come together, they create a safe space where they can exchange knowledge, offer emotional support, and build confidence in managing their conditions. Research shows thatpeer supportcan lead to fewer hospital stays, stronger social networks, and improved self-esteem. A strong community provides: Many Mental Health Foundation programmes include an element of community-based peer supporting.  For example, theLiving Wellproject in Scotland supported people with long-term health conditions by providing tailored mental health support via partner organisations focused on specific conditions. In partnership with the Health and Social Care Alliance Scotland (the ALLIANCE), the initiative supported charities to deliver emotional wellbeing services by providing their staff with training and access to peer learning networks. In Northern Ireland, theMental Health for Better Daysproject, developed in collaboration with the Healthy Living Centre Alliance, integrated mental health support into chronic pain management programmes. This initiative equipped centre staff with the tools to help people learn to better manage their mental wellbeing, offering training on trauma-informed practices, stigma reduction, and mental health inequalities. Since its launch, hundreds of participants have reported increased confidence in discussing their mental health and seeking support when needed.Participant Bill* began to share his experiences with others.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/online-safety-and-mental-health-are-more-connected-ever,Online safety and mental health are more connected than ever before,"Location:United Kingdom, England, Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland Today, most people in the UK spend time in online communities, whether that be social media like Facebook or X, video platforms like TikTok or Twitch, or messaging services like WhatsApp and Discord. Through these communities, many of us form friendships, explore our identities, and connect with our peers in ways previous generations couldn’t have imagined. And the mental health benefits of those connections are undeniable. But those digital spaces are not always safe. While there are many supportive and uplifting online communities, there are also harmful ones that promote hatred, self-harm, and dangerous misinformation. The mental health impacts of these negative environments can be catastrophic, so it’s essential that each one of us feels well-versed in embracing the good, and avoiding the bad. This is why, as part of our ‘Community’ theme for Mental Health Awareness Week, we’ve chosen to explore people’s online communities, and suggest what we all – and the government – can do to better navigate an increasingly complex online world. In April 2025, we undertook some polling which painted a concerning picture: most young people (85%) access online communities daily, butnearly 7 in 10 (68%) have encountered harmful or disturbing content while online, including suicide & pro-eating disorder content, racism, misogyny, and bullying. For those caught in toxic online spaces, the damage can be profound. Hate-fuelled communities deepen feelings of isolation and reinforce destructive ideologies, like the ‘incel’ movement. Exposure to self-harm content can drive vulnerable individuals toward dangerous decisions. And while supportive online spaces exist, without education on digital literacy and self-protection, young people may not always recognise the difference between helpful and harmful content. This is especially important given that regulation of the online world is still not where it needs to be – something we continue to push for through our advocacy work. We need to see urgent action from social media platforms and regulators to make online communities safer: but such changes do not appear to be on the horizon. Until they are, education will be critical. Schools are uniquely positioned to prepare young people forhealthy and informed online engagement, just as they already teach about relationships, democracy, and personal well-being. This needs to be built into our education from day one. Yet, right now, online safety education is failing many students.10% of young people aged 16-21 report receiving no education on online safety at all, and58% of those who have feel it wasn’t useful enough. Teachers, too, are struggling - overthree quarters of secondary school teachershave reported concerns about the rise of online misogyny. They need better resources and training to help students navigate these challenges. We are calling for the government to make urgent reforms. Some of these reforms may only be relevant to England, while others are for the entire UK. As much as government must help reform education in this area, we all need to be equipped with practical tools to navigate our digital lives. Here are some key tips to ensure online spaces support our mental well-being, rather than harm it. Mental health doesn’t exist in isolation – it’s shaped by our experiences, relationships, and the environments we engage with daily. And for many of us today, the online world is a central part of that. If we truly care about safeguarding mental well-being, we cannot ignore the dangers of the digital world. By making online safety education a priority, we give young people the tools to thrive - not just online, but in every aspect of their lives. And by focusing on our own understanding of the online communities that form a part of our lives, we all stand to improve our mental health. This Mental Health Awareness Week we’re celebrating the ways that communities protect our mental health.

But, our communities are in danger. Recent cuts to welfare are a disaster to the ability of communities to be spaces of safety, care, and support.

We must fight for our communities. Positive online communities can support our mental health, as long as we're staying safe online. Read tips from the Mental Health Foundation's Young Leaders.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/importance-community-refugees-and-asylum-seekers,The importance of community for refugees and asylum seekers,"Location:United Kingdom, England, Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland This Refugee Week, we’re reflecting on the theme of “Community as a Superpower”. At the Mental Health Foundation, we know that community is more than just a collection of people. It provides a feeling of belonging, of being welcomed, supported and understood. For many refugees and asylum seekers who have been forced to flee their homes, families and communities, rebuilding this sense of belonging is crucial for their wellbeing and success in their country of sanctuary. In this blog, we’ll explore the ways in which refugees and asylum seekers struggle to access community along with potential policy solutions which can aid in their integration into communities across the UK. A “community” is a group of people brought together through something they share in common. This might be based on geographic location or we might connect with people based on shared interests or values, whether that’s at school or work, through a faith group, at a club where you enjoy a hobby, or through online groups or an activist network. At its core, a healthy community can provide a sense of belonging, safety, support in hard times, and a sense of purpose. People who are more socially connected arehappier, physically healthier, and live longer, with fewer mental health problems. But while a lot of us may be fortunate enough to be a part of a community or even various communities, many refugees and asylum seekers are often starting again from scratch - arriving in unfamiliar towns, facing isolation, and navigating systems that can feel impersonal or even hostile. For them, community is vital lifeline. Fleeing one's home country is a decision which no one makes lightly and is often a last resort. Many asylum seekers and refugees are forced by violence, persecution, or war to be uprooted from their communities and social networks - circumstances that leave lasting scars, both physically and mentally. While seeking sanctuary in a safe country like the UK can mark the beginning of a fresh start, the reality is far from simple. The journey is fraught with uncertainty - awaiting Home Office decisions, coping with frequent relocations, the threat of detention or deportation, financial struggles with no right to work, and experiences of racism and discrimination. All of these factors compound the mental health challenges faced by asylum seekers, making it harder for them to heal from past trauma, connect with others and integrate into new communities. A survey of refugees in Londonfound that 58% of those interviewed identified loneliness as their biggest challenge when attempting to settle into a new country. Loneliness has been widely evidenced as beinglinked to poorer mental health, including depression and suicidal thoughts. That’s why meaningful social contact and community engagement is so essential. One method of achieving this is through peer support interventions which have been effective in reducing feelings of loneliness. Peer support groups for asylum seekers and refugees allow individuals to meet others in their communities in a similar situation, and this increased social support has been linked withenhanced wellbeing. Our Perthyn community programme in Wales trained women with experience of seeking asylum to lead peer support groups focused on emotional literacy, new friendships, reducing isolation. Participantsreportedfeeling a stronger sense of belonging and less loneliness.Wider researchhas also found that peer interventions for asylum seekers and refugees can aid community integration and improve access to community resources, as well as offering benefits in emotional support. But these connections can’t thrive without additional structural changes throughout the asylum system. A stable home is an important foundation for safety, connection and community building. But for many asylum seekers, this is far out of reach. For them, it is common to spend months or even years in hotel accommodation, often with poor living conditions and cut off from local communities. It is almost inevitable that mental health problems are more likely to arise as a result. Onestudyfound through analysis of clinical data from 110 participants, higher levels of mental health difficulties for people seeking asylum living in hotels compared to those living in alternative housing. Many asylum seekers reported feeling a lack of safety and autonomy, social isolation and feelings of imprisonment. Housing instability is also a huge issue that has uprooted many asylum seekers from the few social connections they were able to initially make. Many asylum seekers are moved multiple times between different types of accommodation across the country with no choice over where they can be sent. The negative mental health outcomes of such instability in accommodation have been widely recorded with one study finding that asylum seekersreportedthat the constant movement between regions of the UK was one of the biggest barriers to feeling settled and part of a community. These barriers not only increase the feelings of isolation and anxiety that individuals may already feel as they wait for their asylum applications to be processed, but also impede integration efforts as a whole. Ultimately, if community is about roots, then housing instability keeps pulling those roots up before they can even take hold. Being unable work does not only mean financial hardship – it also removes a sense of purpose and confidence to connect with others. Asylum seekers in the UK can only apply for permission to work after 12 months and even then jobs are limited to anarrow list of skilled roles. This forced unemployment increases experiences ofloneliness,financial strain, andloss of self-esteem. All these aspects further limit one’s ability to engage in social contact. Granting asylum seekers the right to work would enhance their wellbeing, restore dignity and strengthen their chances of integrating into their new communities. Volunteering also offers asylum seekers and refugees an opportunity to contribute to their local community, build confidence and feel more connected.Researchhas shown that it can support skills development, improve wellbeing and encourage feelings of social inclusion. Our Young Leaders have also shared how volunteering has benefited them: Recognising these various challenges, the Mental Health Foundation has developed several policy recommendations on what needs to change in order to help refugees and asylum seekers with their integration into their local communities throughout the UK. Our report on the mental health of refugees and asylum seekers outlines the barriers to employment, difficulties accessing services, experience cultural differences, and discrimination and stigma connected to being a migrant and/or their other characteristics. This LGBT History Month, as we reflect on the theme of Activism and Social Change, it’s important to recognise the experiences of LGBT+ asylum seekers and refugees, and the work being done to create a more humane and inclusive asylum system.

      / Challenging mental health inequalities This piece explores some of the historical factors that affect mental health within the Black community, explains how this history shapes Black mental health today, why ‘resilience’ can be a double-edged term, and what should change to address these inequalities. 2nd Jul 2025
      / Challenging mental health inequalities The government has released the latest data about mental illness and treatment across the population in England. It confirms that more people than ever are struggling with their mental health - and they are not making it up. This content is tagged with: Home of Mental Health Awareness Week"
https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/englands-mental-health-getting-worse,England's mental health is getting worse,"Location:England The government has released the latest wave of results from the much-delayed Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (APMS), which monitors mental illness and treatment across the population in England every 7 years. It confirms what we and many mental health professionals have been saying for years:  more people than ever are struggling with their mental health - and they are not making it up. More than one in five adults (22.6%) are being clinically assessed as having a common mental health condition, compared to 18.9% in 2014. That’s a 20% increase. Amongst young adults the rise is even more drastic, with one in four experiencing a common mental health condition, a 47% increase from 2014. If this was any other area of health, a rise of this nature would prompt a public outcry and and an urgent government response. Instead, there has been a muted response from the government. This may be because the government has at times promoted a myth - that the numbers of people experiencing mental ill-health are overinflated.  In fact the APMS data points to the risks of under-reporting, rather than diagnostic inflation. As APMS lead researcher Sally McManus said: “There’s no evidence from our data to indicate over-reporting, but in the past there may well have been under-reporting.” The APMS is particularly valuable in this conversation, because it provides clinically reliable and credible data about mental ill-health. It uses high quality screening and assessment tools, which demonstrate levels of distress widely accepted by clinicians to indicate genuine illness. This makes it an invaluable tool for evidencing the extent of the mental health crisis – and its unequal distribution. In other words, thanks to this data, nobody serious can deny that England’s mental health crisis is real. The data also confirms another vital fact for policymakers - socioeconomic factors, like a person’s job or financial situation, have a close relationship with mental health. Problem debt and economic inactivity are closely linked to a range of mental health concerns including common mental health conditions and increased risk of suicide attempts. Living in one of the five most deprived areas in England makes having a common mental health condition more likely (26.2% prevalence in the most deprived areas compared to16% in the least). The good news is that, with some willing, the UK government can take political decisions that improve people’s living conditions and financial wellbeing, and at the same time, help to prevent poor mental health. We need a response that is appropriate for the problem in front of us. The government talks about shifting to prevention and nowhere is this more vital than in mental health. We need to invest in the mental health of the nation, avoiding additional stress on our health and welfare services. We are calling on the government to re-build its decimated national public mental health teams and develop a cross departmental plan for mental health that prioritises prevention and addresses the holistic factors affecting our mental health. These statistics make it clear that the time for dismissing people’s suffering is over. England’s mental health is getting worse – full stop. Now is the time for action. The government has an opportunity to create the conditions for everyone to experience good mental health across the UK. We set out what needs to be done to improve the mental health of the UK population. 29th Oct 2025

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/mentally-healthy-workplaces-2025,Mentally healthy workplaces in 2025,"Location:United Kingdom, England, Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland We are proud to share the evaluation of our recent one-year pilot of a 32-hour working week, along with the news that the Mental Health Foundation has made this a permanent initiative for staff, because of the substantial wellbeing benefits it has generated. While most staff were optimistic about the pilot, it delivered beyond our expectations. Not only have we seen incontrovertible improvements in wellbeing, but we are confident that our impact as a charity is undamaged – and may have been boosted by a greater sense of focus and flourishing. There is good news on equalities too, with the flexible reduced week providing specific support to staff with lived experience of poor mental health, disabilities, and parenting or caring responsibilities. As an organisation focused on the promotion of good mental health, we naturally wanted high-quality insights into the 32-hour week’s effects in this area. We measured changes using the respected Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale, which interpretsmental wellbeing as ‘feeling good and functioning well’- and68% of survey respondents showed statistically significant improvements.We also used the Office for National Statistics’ measure for overall life satisfaction, which considerswellbeing as a holistic concept- and64% of people showed statistically significant improvements. Through in-depth interviews and free-text survey responses, we explored the contribution of the 32-hour week to different dimensions of wellbeing and mental health. Colleagues described how they are using their extra time for a wide range ofactivitieswhich MHF encourages as promotinggood mental health– but particularly, healthy movement (58% of colleagues) and time with family and friends (60%). People also see great value in having space to address ‘life admin’ in a less pressurised way, so that they feel less overwhelmed and can enjoy more meaningful activities. Chores are not glamorous, but this genuine sense of relief reflects the pressurised, busy reality of our modern lives. Areduction in stressstands out throughout – when thinking about responsibilities at home, during leisure activities like hosting friends, as a general mindset, and when dealing with work pressures. Despite having less time, 69% of colleagues reported less work-related stress. People often used words like ‘space’ and ‘breathing’, and feel more incontrolof their time and their lives. Thepositive feelingsexperienced range fromday-to-day peace, energy and enjoyment, to what is called‘eudaimonic’ wellbeing – a sense of growth and of fulfilling our potential. People have more time to live in line with their values, for example by developing their careers through study, or supporting ageing family members. Some also relish their continued sense of achievement in their job, having found more energy and efficiencies at work. People find that the reduced working week gives them betterbalance, not only between work and home, but between work, the needs of others, and themselves; between necessities and fulfilment. This can be particularly important for parents, carers, and those living without other adults. Unsurprisingly, 79% of staff reported a better work/life balance at the end of the pilot. Having more time can help us todeal with challenges,for example through more reflection from a distance on problems at work, or even a chance to meet fundamental human needs like being with loved ones towards the end of their lives. There is a pervasive sense of betterpresence and focus. People feel better able to compartmentalise their lives, so that they can pay more attention to quality time with their children, concentrate better on their priorities at work, and even feel more mindful while doing household chores. For some people, the benefits of the 32-hour week are even greater than expected, often because freedom over their particular working pattern optimises it for their particular circumstances. People have either established new routines or are actively enjoying the freedom to incorporate variety, and they expect the pilot’s benefits to be sustained. It’s important to be realistic about the challenges of a new way of working. For a few people there is increased pressure due to the pilot’s interaction with other difficulties, and challenges in adjusting internal collaboration to the reduced week. However, our leadership team and the majority of staff feel that the 32-hour week has not damaged outputs, or that it is having a positive impact. There is evidence that the 32-hour week is bolstering recruitment and retention, and interacts positively with the important process of strategic prioritisation. Our report explores the explanations and success factors for maintained performance within a reduced week, and makes recommendations for organisations considering their own pilot. Our workforce is highly motivated by the charity’s mission, and staff clearly experience a synergy between achievements at work, and their overall wellbeing. Indeed, our study found that quantitative self-rated productivity improvements are statistically correlated with increases in mental wellbeing, life satisfaction, and work/life balance. There is a sense of being valued by MHF as an employer which supports people’s commitment even further. Overall, the 32-hour week is an initiative that will enhance MHF’s success into the future and keep us competitive as an employer, in a changing world where rapid advances create the potential for a revolution in working lives.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/uks-asylum-system-must-work-everyone,The UK's asylum system must work for everyone,"Location:United Kingdom Dear Parliamentarian,  The anti-asylum seeker protests across the country in recent weeks are deeply worrying, particularly given last year’s racist riots. A government minister has claimed that the protestors are upset for “legitimate reasons”, without acknowledging that some organisers have neo-Nazi links. It is alarming that there has been little empathy shown towards asylum seekers themselves, many of whom are fleeing trauma and persecution. As an organisation working to protect asylum seekers’ mental health, we too find the UK’s current asylum system unacceptable, for different reasons. Asylum seekers are denied agency, community, and sometimes even medical care. All of these factors severely damage mental wellbeing. The system forces asylum seekers into limbo - unable to work, travel, house themselves, or integrate - and systematically undermines their mental health. Asylum seekers are left to become sitting ducks for ire, wrongly perceived by some as ‘on the take’ or here with wrongful intentions, but in reality desperate to give back and live in peace. This provides fuel for racist hatred, while working to poison public opinion against them.  The mental health toll extends beyond asylum seekers. Local communities are being polarised, public discourse is increasingly hostile, and many people - regardless of their views - feel anxious and powerless. A humane, efficient asylum system would help to restore a sense of compassion, stability and shared purpose in our society.  An important part of the solution is the development ofa national integration strategy, already in place in Scotland and Wales, but absent in England. Without it, asylum seekers face endless uncertainty, isolation, and poor access to services. Meanwhile, surrounding local communities, many of them low-income, are denied opportunities to foster relationships with them and are left vulnerable to misinformation and racist rhetoric.  This integration strategy must be co-created with local authorities, civil society and people with lived experience of seeking refuge. It should include:   These measures have public support and are economically sound. For example granting work rights could add £4.4 billion to the economy as well as promote further integration.

But it can also be intense and stressful and this can have a huge impact on your mental health. It’s important to look after yourself and your wellbeing during your time at university. So whether you are starting university or returning for a new term, here are some tips to help you prepare for, make the most of and look after your mental health during your time there. It’s important before you even step foot on campus to be as prepared as possible, as this can help to reduce stress. Have a checklist of all the things you need to do before you start the first semester. Some things to consider include: If you are an international student, you can find out more information about funding your studieshere. Once you reach university it might all start to feel very real which may in turn impact your mental health, here are some things to remember/consider when you get there: Making the most of opportunities:University is about more than just what you study, it presents a great opportunity to try new things and gain new skills. Be sure to dedicate some time outside of your studies to making the most of university and being a student. Check out the societies fair, join a sports club, get involved with campaigns both on campus and in the local community. Don’t be afraid to try something new and if it’s not for you that’s okay. But,you might just end up finding a new passion or future job opportunity. Do what's best for you:While a lot of fun, university can also present a lot of challenges and pressures that you may not have been ready for. It’s important that you prioritise your health and wellbeing while at university to ensure that not only you do your best but also that you feel good and enjoy yourself. Self-care can present itself in many ways, it could be choosing to stay in instead of going on a night out, cooking a favourite meal at the end of a long week and so much more.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/tackling-childhood-health-inequalities-scotland,Tackling childhood health inequalities in Scotland,"Location:Scotland Every child deserves the chance to grow up healthy, happy, safe, and supported. Childhood health inequalities in Scotland are deeply unjust, but they are not inevitable. Scotland needs a bold, joined-up preventative policy approach. On 27 February 2025, the Mental Health Foundation and the Royal Society of Edinburgh (RSE) co-hosted a national workshop on childhood health inequalities. More than 40 experts from the public, voluntary and academic sectors came together to identify and bridge gaps between research, policy, and practice and jointly confront a stark reality: Scotland’s children continue to face profound and preventable health inequalities. It is to Scotland’s shame that children growing up in our most socio-economically deprived areas experience significantly worse physical and mental health outcomes than children in more affluent areas.  They are: These disparities result in deeply damaging long-term personal, societal and economic costs by stymying people’s life-chances based on their position in society.  They also perpetuate cycles of disadvantage across generations. Expert discussions during the workshop identified three recurring gaps holding back progress: Disconnect between research, policy, and practice.Despite a wealth of research, too often it fails to shape policy effectively, and national strategies frequently fail to translate at the local level. Missed opportunities for co-design.Families, children, and diverse communities are rarely meaningfully included in shaping policies that affect them. The exclusion of lived experience as a central feature of such policies often makes them less effective in practice. Data limitations.Current tools don’t capture the full picture. Experts stressed the need for richer, more accessible data—including qualitative insights—to truly understand what works, for whom, and why. There was acknowledgement that these gaps sit within a broader context of significant underfunding across public services, with particular implications for third sector organisations  burdened by short term funding cycles and related bureaucracy. Read the full report The key overarching message from the workshop is the urgent need to make a decisive shift from reactive, short-term fixes to preventative, upstream interventions to meet the Scottish Government’s child poverty targets by 2030. This means investing in better living conditions, equitable access to services, stable incomes, food security, trauma-informed whole-family support, and inclusive, community-led policy design. Workshop participants were also clear that bridging the gaps between research, policy and practice to reduce childhood health inequalities therefore necessitates the following actions: Every child deserves the chance to grow up healthy, happy, safe, and supported. Childhood health inequalities in Scotland are deeply unjust, but they are not inevitable. They are the result of political choices—about policy, investment, and priorities. As the workshop’s findings make clear, Scotland needs a bold, joined-up preventative policy approach, rooted in equity and empathy to effectively tackle these inequalities.  With a Scottish Parliament Election on the horizon, now is the time for policymakers to show how they intend to put such an approach into practice.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/black-mental-health-and-resilience,Black mental health and resilience,"Location:United Kingdom, England, Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Falkirk, Glasgow, Scottish Highlands, Overseas This piece explores some of the historical factors that affect mental health within the Black community, explains how this history shapes Black mental health today, why ‘resilience’ can be a double-edged term, and what should change to address these inequalities. This piece explores topics of racism and discrimination which some may find upsetting, please read with care. There are details of where to find support at thebottom of this page. “Resilient” is a term often used to describe the Black community, and while not an innately negative word, not enough consideration has been given to the impact that term has within the context of Black mental health and wellbeing. We all need resilience. By definition, being resilient means being able to adapt to life's misfortunes and setbacks, something which is vitally important to our mental health and wellbeing. However, there are important nuances within this definition. When the setbacks are rooted in things like systemic racism and discrimination we must ask if the term is truly being used to empower or being used to cover over centuries of complex trauma. Resilience helps people cope; it should never be used to excuse systems that cause harm. To understand this a bit better let’s look to the past. Throughout history Black people have experienced neglect, racism, and discrimination by healthcare institutions who were either unwilling or unable to cater to their needs. This has been the result of historical legacies of colonialism, slavery, and historical malpractice1. Even the idea of resilience within the Black community can be traced back to a racist myth that Black people have thicker skin or less sensitive nerve endings than white people – a statement which 40% of white medical trainees believe6. Because of everything that Black people have endured throughout history there is this idea that they are “stronger” an idea which not only is untrue but has many unintended consequences for mental health. It’s also important to note that those living today still feel the trauma and impact on their mental health of the historical racism, discrimination and colonialism their ancestors experienced through intergenerational trauma, so even Black people who did not experience a trauma directly may have inherited trauma symptoms, such as anxiety and mood dysregulation7. Despite positive steps and contributions towards Black mental health (see:The unsung heroes of Black history and mental health) there is often still a lot of taboo around mental health and talking about mental struggles. A recent study showed that Black people are significantly less likely to seek mental health treatment8as well as being less likely to talk openly and honestly about mental health struggles. This is in part due to the perception of strength discussed earlier, resulting in the perception among some Black people that talking about mental health may be seen as a sign of “weakness” or “vulnerability”. Both as individuals and as a community there is much, we can do to address these inequalities including: There is still much to be done to address inequalities for Black people within mental health. For allies it is important to consider language (like using the terms ""strong"" or ""resilient without considering the context) and address any biases (either conscious or unconscious) that could be creating barriers. And for those in the Black community, remind yourself and those around you that it is okay not to be okay, we all experience mental health struggles, and your lived experience adds in an additional layer of intricacy. Resilience is important, but so is vulnerability. It is also important to remember our intersectional identities and the complexity, care and consideration that need to be given also, while as community Black people share a lot of struggles through things like intergenerational trauma and shared experiences racism, the community is not monolithic, everyone is still a unique individual and that needs to be considered in support. With that being said don’t be afraid to reach out when you need help and uplift others around you to reach out for help also. If you’re Black you may face difficult experiences, like discrimination and microaggressions, that can affect your mental health. It may feel helpful to get support from an organisation with a deeper understanding of your lived experienced. (This doesn’t mean that other mental health services aren’t for you – as services should always be inclusive and welcoming.) Below are some organisations to check out. 2nd Jul 2025

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/university-alcohol-and-mental-health,"University, alcohol and mental health","Location:United Kingdom, England, Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Falkirk, Glasgow, Scottish Highlands, Overseas For a long time, students and universities have been intrinsically linked to alcohol and “drinking culture”. There has been a perception that students drink a lot and often, but is this still the case? Read on for information about drinking trends at university, how alcohol can affect your mental health and advice on how to navigate drinking at university. This blog explores current trends in student drinking and the impact that alcohol can have on our mental health, particularly for university students.Thecontent mentions substance abuse or addiction (which may include mentions of alcohol or drug use), suicide or suicidal thoughts, self-harm, depression and anxiety. Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at thebottom of this page. Many students at university choose to drink alcohol, this can be for several reasons: to socialise, celebrate or just because it is often the expected thing for students to do. However, increasingly more students are choosing to not drink or to drink less, perhaps because of the cost of alcohol, healthier lifestyle choices, personal reasons or something else entirely. Research from theSOS Drug and Alcohol Impact Surveyshows that: Many students are facing financial difficulties due to the cost of living; many are finding it necessary to make cutbacks to manage their finances. TheNatWest Student Living Indexreveals that students are prioritising essential spending, with half reducing spending on nights out. Almost a quarter (24%) say that they don’t go to nightclubs with and one in five (20%) avoid going to the pub. While 76% of students agree that drinking and getting drunk is part of university culture, an increasing number of students are choosing to drink less or not to drink, as of 2025 over a quarter of students do not drink which has almost doubled since 2017. 78% of students also have said that they do not need to be drunk to have a good night out and 75% said that excessive drinking can make people hard to socialise with or cut a night out short. There is a clearer understanding by students of the impact that drinking can have as well as an increasing number of drink-free social events which is resulting in many students drinking less frequently (20% once a week and 29% less than once a week) or not at all. Whether or not you decide to drink at university, it is important to be well informed about the effects of alcohol on your mental health. Alcohol is a depressant which means it is a substance that reduces arousal and stimulation. These affect the central nervous system, slowing down the messages between the brain and body and this can have a direct effect on how you think, feel and behave. When you drink you may feel more relaxed, confident and less anxious. But these effects quickly wear off. The chemical changes in your brain can soon lead to more negative feelings, such as anger, depression or anxiety, regardless of your mood. Alcohol and ill mental health (particularly depression and anxiety) are closely linked and those who drink alcohol are more likely to develop mental health problems, the reduced inhibitions that can result from drinking can also lead to other issues such asself-harmorsuicidal thoughts. For more general information on how alcohol affects our mental health check out ourA-Z on alcohol. Of the students at university who do drink: 44% reported that they missed a university seminar, lecture or class during or following the consumption of alcohol 13% of respondents identified that drinking alcohol (during or following) had made an existing mental condition worse 46% reported being unable to remember what happened the night before 30% experienced unwanted sexual attention 27% took risks with their personal safety they otherwise would not have 27% Injured themselves It’s clear that drinking can have an impact on both mental health and university experience. The effects of drinking and the impact of alcohol will differ depending on the person, but it is important to be aware of the potential risks associated with drinking especially as it may impact your time and enjoyment of university. University can be an incredibly rewarding and memorable time in your life.  Whether you choose to drink at university or not is entirely up to you, but it is important to make sure if you do decide to drink, that you are doing so in an informed and safe manner. Drinkaware has some great tools for informed drinking and understating risk. UK low risk drinking guidelines Drinking Check tool Remember: you don’t need to drink to have a good time at university.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/covid-19-resources,How to look after your mental health during the coronavirus outbreak,"Infectious disease outbreaks such as coronavirus (COVID-19) can be scary and can affect our mental health. While it’s important to stay informed, it’s also vital we look after our mental wellbeing. After living in a pandemic for so long, you may be feeling exhausted, fed up, depressed or anxious. You may have experienced bereavement, furlough or unemployment as well as loneliness, disruption to normal life, and relationship stress. While some of us have been able to enjoy new family routines or more time outdoors, for many of us life feels difficult and uncertain. We have created a COVID-19 resources hub to give helpful tips and advice across all our nations that we hope will help you, your friends, and your family to look after your mental health.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/en/explore-mental-health/covid-19-resources/our-coronavirus-response-programme,Our Coronavirus response programme,"Date:Wed, 01/20/2021 - 09:00 2020 will be known as the year when the world faced and responded to one of the greatest public health challenges of our era. Schools and workplaces closed, travel ground to a halt, cities and neighbourhoods fell quiet. Amongst the deaths and physical illness, we have also seen the emergence of psychological suffering, loneliness and distress. Even before Covid-19 we knew that mental health was our biggest national concern. We are now at serious risk of a rising tide of poor mental health. And whilst Covid-19 has touched us all, it has magnified and accelerated mental health inequalities across our society. The poorest, the most marginalised and the most discriminated-against, have been even more disconnected and disadvantaged. However, we know that it does not need to be this way. Individuals, communities and workers of all kinds have shown remarkable resilience and kindness throughout the pandemic. With the right action, a mental health catastrophe can be prevented. As the UK’s leading charity for the public’s mental health, we are launching a major initiative to develop community prevention programmes across the four nations of the UK, helping those in greatest need.In the first instance our programmes will support groups who we know have been hit hard by Covid-19: single parent families; people with long term health conditions, refugees and people from minority ethnic communities. Our own nationally renowned ‘Coronavirus: Mental Health in the Pandemic’study has told us that these groups are struggling now and that without help this will endure. So with the help and support from key donors like you, we are planning on investing £2m to expand our well-evidenced programmes. We are also joining forces with other charities and community organisations so that we can reach communities at scale. We are launching this new programme at the start of this year and it will run for the next three years. Our goal is not just to help people now but also to support other organisations, and give them the tools and techniques to make mental health their number one priority too. There really is no health without mental health. This programme is ambitious and will draw upon our teams from across the UK, but with your support we can make a real difference.

Причина для ваших почуттів може бути очевидною – наприклад, тяжка втрата або стрес на роботі, – а може бути вам невідомою. У будь-якому випадку, шукати допомоги – це нормально. Багатьом із нас важко знайти слова, щоб розповісти про свої почуття. Але ви не повинні відкладати запис на прийом до настання кризової ситуації. Підготовка може трохи полегшити бесіду з лікарем. Що скоріше ви підете до лікаря, то швидше відчуєте покращення. Підготовка може допомогти вам отримати максимум користі відконсультаціїлікаря. Ви можете дещо зробити під час вашого прийому, щоб отримати максимальну користь від консультації. Наш безкоштовний посібникЯк говорити з лікарем про своє психічне здоров’япропонує додаткові ідеї про те, як отримати максимум користі від консультації. Ваше лікар, ймовірно, запитає вас про: На основі того, що ви розповіли, ваш лікар може: Зазвичай лікар призначає наступну консультацію через декілька тижнів, щоб дізнатись, як ви себе почуваєте. Безумовно, ви можете самі домовитись про прийом раніше, якщо справи не покращуються або вас щось непокоїть. Все, що ви скажете вашому лікарю, залишиться конфіденційним, за винятком випадків, коли існує ризик заподіяння серйозної шкоди собі або іншим людям. У цьому випадку лікар все ж повинен, загалом, тримати вас у курсі того, що відбуватиметься далі. Можливо, він попросить вас прийти на прийом знову найближчим часом, самому сповістити інших людей, або повідомити іншого спеціаліста в сфері охорони здоров'я або соціальної допомоги, щоб вони могли провести оцінку та вирішити, чи вам потрібна госпіталізація. У дуже рідких випадках вони можуть повідомити поліцію. Третина всіх лікарських прийомів пов’язана з психічним благополуччям, отже, ваш лікар вже звик до вислуховування проблем психічного здоров’я. Вони не осуджуватимуть вас за психічне захворювання, так само, як не осуджували б за висип або біль у животі. Якщо у вас депресія або тривожний розлад, такі думки можуть бути симптомами вашого стану. Низька самооцінка та страх, що всім байдуже і ніхто не розуміє вас – звичайне явище. Постарайтеся, щоб такі думки не завадили вам записатись на прийом. І пам’ятайте – якщо ви не задоволені лікуванням, яке надає вам лікар, ви можете вибрати іншого лікаря або іншу амбулаторію. Щоб записатись на прийом до лікаря, ви повинні зареєструватись в місцевій амбулаторії. Зареєструватись в амбулаторії та записуватись на прийом до їхніх лікарів (GP)можна легко та швидко. Ви можете зателефонувати, надіслати електронне повідомлення або навідатись до місцевої амбулаторії, щоб дізнатись, чи ви можете там зареєструватись. Щоб знайти амбулаторію лікаря загальної практики: Ви можете змінити свого лікаря, коли побажаєте. Наприклад, можливо, ви схочете перейти до нової амбулаторії, якщо мали неприємний досвід у своїй нинішній амбулаторії, або якщо бажаєте перейти до амбулаторії, яка надає послуги психологічної допомоги або з охорони психічного здоров’я. В Англіївеб-сайт служби NHSдозволяє вам оглядати рейтинг та відгуки людей, які користуються послугами амбулаторій. Якщо ви не задоволені консультацією або не впевнені щодо наданої вам поради, ви можете звернутись до іншого лікаря (GP) або спеціаліста за другою думкою. Ви можете записатись на прийом до іншого лікаря (GP) у вашій амбулаторії, або взагалі змінити амбулаторію, якщо вони відмовляються надати вам можливість звернутися за другою думкою. Якщо ви не згодні з лікуванням, яке ваш лікар (GP) підібрав для вашої проблеми з психічним здоров’ям, або якщо ви не задоволені послугою, яку надав лікар, можливо, ви захочете подати скаргу. Щоб подати письмову скаргу, зверніться до вашого лікаря (GP) або адміністратора амбулаторії. Спитайте в реєстратурі про процедуру подання скарг у цій амбулаторії або знайдіть її на їх веб-сайті.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/a-z-topics/alcohol-and-mental-health,Alcohol and mental health,"This content mentions substance abuse or addiction (which may include mentions of alcohol or drug use), suicide or suicidal thoughts, self-harm, depression and anxiety. Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. Alcohol and mental health are closely linked. Drinking too much can affect your well-being. Some people may drink to try to relieve the symptoms of mental ill-health. People drink for many reasons: to celebrate, socialise, commiserate or drown our sorrows. We may drink to try and change our mood: to feel more relaxed, courageous or confident. However, the effect of alcohol is only temporary. As it wears off, we often feel worse because of how alcohol withdrawal affects our brain and body. You may feel like alcohol is your coping mechanism: a way to deal withdepression,stress,anxietyor other difficult feelings. You might be nervous about what life would be like if you stopped drinking or cut back. But relying on alcohol to manage your mental well-being can become a problem in itself. There’s no shame in asking for help and exploring what a new relationship with alcohol could look like. Alcohol is a depressant, which can disrupt the balance of neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) in your brain and affect your feelings, thoughts and behaviour. Alcohol affects the part of your brain that controls inhibition, so you may feel relaxed, less anxious, and more confident after a drink. But these effects quickly wear off. The chemical changes in your brain can soon lead to more negative feelings, such as anger, depression or anxiety, regardless of your mood. Alcohol also slows down how your brain processes information, making it harder to work out what you’re really feeling and the possible consequences of your actions. In the long-term, alcohol uses up and reduces the number of neurotransmitters in our brains, but we need a certain level to ward off anxiety and depression. This can make you want to drink more to relieve these difficult feelings – which can start a cycle of dependence. In the short-term, drinking too much can lead to alcohol poisoning,sleep problems, an upset stomach, bloating and migraines. It may make you behave recklessly or aggressively, have an accident or become the victim of violence. Drinking a lot for many years will take its toll on your body. Long-term alcohol misuse increases your risk of serious health conditions, including heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, liver disease and cancer. It can lead to social problems such as relationship break-ups, unemployment, financial difficulties and homelessness. Dealing withphysical health problems,debtandhousingissues can all affect your mental health. Alcohol problems and mental ill health are closely linked. Research shows that people who drink alcohol are more likely to develop mental health problems. It’s also true that people with severe mental illness are more likely to have alcohol problems. This may be because they ‘self-medicate’, meaning they drink to deal with difficult feelings or symptoms. Regular heavy drinking is linked to symptoms ofdepression. People with depression who drink alcohol often start to feel better within the first few weeks of stopping drinking. If you try this and feel better, it’s likely the alcohol was causing your depression. If your symptoms of depression continue, speak to your GP for help. It’s generally not recommended to drink if you’re taking antidepressants. Alcohol can make depression worse and increase the side effects of some antidepressants. If you’re trying to cut down or stop drinking,research showssome antidepressants can increase your risk of relapsing. The NHS website has more information onalcohol and antidepressants. If you experienceanxiety, alcohol can give you a very short-lived feeling of relaxation – but this quickly disappears. If you rely on alcohol to cover your anxiety, you may soon find yourself drinking more and more to relax. Over time, this can lead to alcohol dependence. You may also find a hangover makes your anxiety worse. If you use alcohol to unwind, think about other ways you can find to relax: meditation, yoga, exercise or making time for things you enjoy, for example. It’s possible to experiencepsychosisif you regularly drink a lot of alcohol or if you’re a heavy drinker and suddenly stop drinking. Because alcohol can make you lose your inhibitions and act more impulsively, it may lead to actions such asself-harmor suicide. Heavy drinking is also linked tosuicidal thoughtsand attempts. If you’re having suicidal feelings, you can callSamaritansfree any time. Call 999 or go to A&E if you’ve hurt yourself or think you might act on suicidal thoughts. The government advises that both men and women should not regularly drink more than 14 units a week. This is the equivalent of six pints of average-strength beer or six medium glasses of wine. If you regularly drink as much of this, it’s best to spread it over three or more days. If you’re worried about drinking or feel it’s affecting your mental health, a lot of help is available. Talk to your GP. It might feel difficult, but they will have heard from many other people going through something similar and will want to help you. They can check your physical health and put you in touch with local support, such aslocal NHS alcohol addiction support services. You can also ask about other support groups ortalking therapiesto help you. If you’re physically dependent on alcohol and need to stop drinking completely, stopping suddenly could be harmful. Your GP can give you advice and/or medication to help you do this safely. If you have a severe mental health problem and a drinking problem, you may be given a ‘dual diagnosis’. If so, mental health services should be in charge of your treatment, rather than drug and alcohol services. Find out more on ourdrugs and mental healthpage. If you want to cut down on your drinking, avoid situations where you’re tempted to drink. If you usually socialise in the pub, think about other activities you could enjoy with friends: going to the cinema, doing an activity together or trying an evening class.Club Soda– which can help you become more mindful about drinking – has more tips on socialising sober. Changing your habits can be tough. Talking to people you trust about your plans may help you change.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/a-z-topics/anorexia-nervosa,Anorexia nervosa,"This content mentions body image or generally discusses weight, eating disorders, anxiety and depression, which some people may find triggering. Anorexia nervosa (commonly referred to as anorexia) is aneating disorderand a serious mental health problem. Someone with anorexia often has an intense fear of gaining weight and may have a distorted view of their body, thinking they’re fat even when they’re underweight. People often think anorexia is about dieting, but it’s more complicated than that. It’s linked to low self-esteem, negativebody imageand many other factors. Anyone can be affected by anorexia. While young women more commonly report it, anorexia is increasingly being reported by men and boys, women over the age of 40, and children as young as seven. The idea of recovery might feel difficult or scary if you're afraid of putting on weight or worried about losing control. You might not feel ready to think about it yet. Just remember that it's possible to feel better, even if it takes a while to get there. If you have anorexia, you may feel: You may also underestimate or deny that you have a problem, even after you’ve been diagnosed. The physical signs of anorexia include: Anorexia can affect your behaviour. You might: With other people, you may lie about what you’ve eaten, make excuses about why you’re not eating or pretend you’ve eaten earlier. You might also lie about how much weight you’ve lost. There is no single cause of anorexia. It usually develops because of a combination of factors. People with anorexia often have common traits, including: Society places a lot of importance onbody image, meaning we’re constantly told that how we look reflects our worth. This can leave us feeling ashamed if we don’t fit the model of a ‘good body’. While these pressures don’t cause eating disorders, they can make us feel we’re not good enough or negatively affect our self-esteem. This can trigger an eating disorder in people already vulnerable to developing one. Research shows there may be genetic links to anorexia. The brain chemicals that control our hunger, appetite and digestion can also make us more likely to develop anorexia. If we have too much or too little of these brain chemicals or are particularly sensitive to them, our appetite and mood can be affected. Living with anorexia can be incredibly difficult, but so too can the idea of recovery. If anorexia has become a big part of your identity, you might wonder who you'll be without it. You might be afraid of not being in control of your food or of how your body might change. It can take time to feel ready to try to recover. Think about what recovery might look like to you and what the benefits could be. Change is possible, even if it doesn't feel like it right now. If you think you have anorexia, start bytalking to your GP. They may not be an expert in treating eating disorders, but they will be able to assess any physical symptoms and then refer you to specialist eating disorder services. Talking therapiescan help you identify the feelings and fears that triggered your anorexia and help you develop a healthier attitude towards food and your body. You may be offered: The ‘Maudsley Approach’ is a type of therapy to help children and young people with anorexia. It involves parents taking an active role in helping to get their child’s weight to a normal level, giving control of eating choices back to the child and then encouraging them to develop healthy independence. You may be offered antidepressants alongside self-help or therapy to manage other conditions such asdepression,anxietyorobsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, antidepressants shouldn’t be the only treatment you’re offered. Most people with anorexia won’t need to go to hospital. However, if your weight is very low, you may be admitted. Your treatment could involve counselling, group and family therapy, and working with a dietician and mental health team. It’s difficult to recover from an eating disorder on your own, but there are things you can try alongside treatment and support. Beat has manytips for recovery, and Mind hasideas for self-care, including managing relapses, changing unhealthy routines and being careful online. You may find that support groups are useful. It can be comforting to talk to others with the same feelings and experiences. You could join Beat’sonline support group for people with anorexia.

Studies show that ADHD may affect certain areas of the brain that allow us to solve problems, plan ahead, understand others’ actions, and control our impulses. Most cases are diagnosed in childhood, but it’s possible to be diagnosed as an adult. ADHD can’t develop for the first time in adults, but you may have had it as a child and not been diagnosed. The symptoms of ADHD fall into two groups: inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness. You may have difficulties that fall into one or both categories. Symptoms of ADHD may present themselves differently. For example, boys with ADHD may be more disruptive in the classroom than girls. Adults are less likely to show hyperactivity. The main symptoms of inattentiveness include: The main symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsiveness include: Many children have phases where they’re restless or can’t concentrate. This doesn’t necessarily mean they have ADHD. But, if you think your child’s behaviour is different to most children their age, speak to their teacher or GP about your concerns. While you can’t develop ADHD as an adult, your symptoms may have been missed as a child. Some children grow out of ADHD, while others continue to have symptoms. Adult symptoms tend to be more subtle than those seen in children. They include: If you have undiagnosed ADHD as an adult, you may find life overwhelming but not know why. You may bestressedout and have problems with work, money and relationships as a result of your ADHD. If you have ADHD, you’re more likely to experience a mental health problem.

The causes of ADHD aren’t fully known, but a combination of factors – including genetics and brain chemistry – are likely responsible. Some people may be more likely to develop ADHD, including those born prematurely or with low birth weights or with epilepsy or brain damage. If you think you or your child could have ADHD,speak to your GP. They can’t formally diagnose you, but they can talk about your concerns and refer you for a specialist assessment if necessary.

Autism is a spectrum condition, meaning it affects people in different ways. Around 1 in 100 people are on the autistic spectrum. Over the years, different terms have been used for autism. We use ‘autistic person' on this page to reflect the growing preference for identity-first language, but it’s important you use the language that feels most comfortable for you. No two autistic people are the same. Autistic people have varying needs ranging from 24-hour care to simply needing a little more time to understand things, for example. However, there are certain traits that most autistic people experience to some degree. These include: While autism can come with challenges, some autistic people find there are positive things about their condition: for example, being more creative, determined, focused or accepting than other people.

Just like everyone, autistic people can have good mental health. However, according to the autism research charity Autistica, seven out of ten autistic people have a mental health condition such asanxiety,depression,attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)orobsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

It’s normal to feel anxious sometimes. It’s how we respond to feeling threatened, under pressure or stressed: for example, if we have an exam, job interview or doctor’s appointment. Anxiety isn’t necessarily a bad thing. It can spur us on, help us stay alert, make us aware of risks and motivate us to solve problems.

Anxiety can affect both your body and mind. The effect on your mind can include: Physical feelings can include: Anxiety can also affect your behaviour. You may withdraw from friends and family, feel unable to go to work, or avoid certain places. While avoiding situations can give you short-term relief, the anxiety often returns the next time you’re in the situation. Avoiding it only reinforces the feeling of danger and never gives you a chance to find out whether your fears are true or not.

Some common anxiety disorders include: Anxiety disorders are among the most common mental health problems. Up to 1 in 20 people in the UK have a generalised anxiety disorder. Many different factors can make anxiety disorders more likely to happen. These include genetics, painfullong-term health conditions,traumatic eventssuch as childhood abuse or domestic violence, ordrugoralcoholmisuse. Your current life situation can also trigger anxiety – for example,moneyorhousingproblems, unemployment,work stress,loneliness, bullying, or difficult family or personal relationships. There are different ways to treat and manage anxiety disorders. The right treatment for you will depend on your type of anxiety disorder, how severe it is and your circumstances. The first step to getting support is usually tospeak to your GP. This might feel hard, especially if your anxiety makes it difficult to speak on the phone or leave your home. See if you can book an appointment online or ask someone to call up to book it for you. They could also come with you to your appointment for support. Or you couldrefer yourself for talking therapy(in England only) if that feels easier. Your GP will assess you during your appointment and then explain your treatment options. Your GP may offer you self-help resources such as workbooks or online CBT courses. These are often available quite quickly and may be enough to help you feel better without trying other options. NHS Inform has anonline anxiety self-help guideyou can work through. This involves working through your thoughts, feelings and behaviours with a mental health professional.

Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. We recognise that not everyone likes the term BAME. It covers a wide range of people with diverse needs, and it can be problematic to put all those people into a single group. However, it can be useful to show that people who aren’t White British can face specific issues and challenges because of their ethnicity. We use BAME here as a shorthand term but acknowledge people can find it unsatisfying or prefer to use a different term to describe themselves. Rates of mental health problems can be higher for some BAME groups than for White people. For example: Some groups have better mental health. For example: With all these statistics, it’s important to note that they might not reflect the true extent of mental health problems among BAME groups. This is because not much data is available and also because BAME people may be less likely to report mental health problems. As well as the factors that can affect everyone’s mental health, people from BAME communities may also contend with racism, inequality and mental healthstigma. Racism can range from micro-aggressions (subtle but offensive comments) to explicit hurtful words to verbal or physical aggression. Experiencing racism can be very stressful and negatively affect your overall health and mental health. Exposure to racism may increase your likelihood of experiencing mental health problems such aspsychosisanddepression. If you’ve experienced racism, read our page onstigma and discrimination. While the page is about mental health, the tips on making a complaint are relevant to all discrimination cases. There is also a list of organisations that can help and advise you. People from BAME communities often face disadvantages in society whichcan increase the risk of developing mental health problems. Different communities understand and talk about mental health in different ways. In some communities, mental health problems are rarely recognised or spoken about. They may be seen as shameful or embarrassing. This can discourage people from talking about their mental health or seeing their GP for help.

Bulimia nervosa (commonly known as bulimia) is aneating disorderand serious mental health problem. Someone with bulimia might feel parts of their lives are out of control and use purging to give them a sense of control. Bulimia is a serious condition that can cause long-term damage, but help is available. Anyone can develop bulimia, but it’s most common in young people aged 13 to 17. If you have bulimia, you may feel: The physical symptoms of bulimia include: Your behaviour may be affected. You may: Bulimia can cause serious physical damage to your body. Vomiting can damage your teeth. Laxative misuse can lead to heart disease and digestive problems such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and constipation. It’s important to get help quickly if you think you have bulimia. There is no single cause of bulimia. There are many reasons why someone might develop bulimia and many factors that can contribute. An eating disorder can be a way of coping with distressing emotions and feelings. Many people report feeling sad or stressed, for example, before they binged. Other common traits include: Research shows there may be genetic links to bulimia. Changes to the chemicals in our brains can also be a factor in developing bulimia. Anyone can develop bulimia. If you’re worried you may have bulimia,contact your GP. They may not be an expert in treating eating disorders, but they will be able to assess any physical symptoms and then refer you to specialist eating disorder services. Treatment may take time, but you can recover from bulimia. You may be offered guided self-help as a first step. This often involves working through a self-help book and sessions with a therapist. The book may take you through a programme that helps you make realistic meal plans, understand your triggers and find other ways to cope with your feelings. You may be offered an online self-help programme calledOvercoming Bulimia Online. It’s free if a healthcare professional gives you a code, or you can pay for access. Talking therapiescan help you tackle your underlying thoughts and feelings triggering bulimia and find healthier ways to cope. You may be offered: Antidepressants shouldn’t be the only treatment you’re offered. However, you may be offered them alongside self-help or therapy to manage other conditions such asdepression,anxietyorobsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Most people with bulimia will stay at home during their treatment. However, if you are very underweight, have heart problems, or are so ill that doctors feel you’re at risk, you may be admitted to a hospital. Doctors will help you gradually reach a healthy weight and either start or continue your therapy. It’s difficult to recover from an eating disorder on your own, but there are things you can try alongside treatment and support. Beat has manytips for recovery, and Mind hasideas for self-care, including managing relapses, changing unhealthy routines and being careful online. You may find that support groups are useful.

Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. Alarmingly, 75% of children and young people who experience mental health problems aren’t getting the help they need. Children’s emotional well-being is just as important as their physical health. Good mental health helps them develop the resilience to cope with whatever life throws at them and grow into well-rounded, healthy adults. Things that can help keep children and young people mentally well include: Other factors are also important, including feeling loved, trusted, understood and safe. Children who are optimistic, and resilient, have some control over their lives and feel like they belong are more likely to have good mental well-being. Most children grow up mentally healthy, but surveys suggest that more children and young people have problems with their mental health today than 30 years ago. Traumatic eventscan trigger mental health problems for children and young people who are already vulnerable. Changessuch as moving home, changing school or the birth of a new sibling, etc., may act as triggers. Some children who start school feel excited about making new friends and doing new activities, but some may also feel anxious. Teenagers often experience emotional turmoil as their minds and bodies develop. Working out and accepting who you are is important to growing up. Some young people find it hard to make this transition to adulthood and may experiment withalcohol,drugsor other substances that can affect mental health. Certain risk factors can make some children and young people more likely to experience mental health problems than others. However, experiencing them doesn’t mean a child will definitely – or even probably – go on to have mental health problems. These factors include: If you’re a young person and you’re worried about your mental health, there is help available. You may want to try the following things. You could text theYoungMinds Crisis Messengerif you need support. A trained volunteer will text with you to help you think through your feelings and signpost you to other support. Mindhas lots of information for young people about understanding your feelings, how to get help and support, what happens when you visit your GP, looking after yourself and more. One of the most important ways parents or guardians can help is by listening to their children and taking their feelings seriously. They may want a hug, they may want you to help them change something, or they may want practical help. Children and young people’s negative feelings usually pass. However, it’s a good idea to get help if your child is distressed for a long time if their feelings are stopping them from getting on with their lives, if their distress is disrupting family life or if they are repeatedly behaving in ways you wouldn’t expect at their age. If your child is having problems at school, a teacher, school nurse, school counsellor or educational psychologist may be able to help. Otherwise, go to your GP or speak to a health visitor. They can refer a child for further help if necessary. Different professionals often work together in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). Most mental health support for children and young people is provided free by the NHS, your child’s school or your local council’s social services department. Young Minds has aParents’ Helplineyou can call if you’re worried about a child up to the age of 25. They provide advice, emotional support and signposting to other services. Treatment for children and young people often involves discussing the problem to work out the best way to tackle it. For young children, this may be done through play. They may be referred to a specialist, such as a trained counsellor, to help them explore their feelings and behaviour. There is a lot of evidence thattalking therapiescan be effective for children and young people, butmedicationmay also help in some cases. Children need to be assessed by a specialist before they are prescribed any medication. The professionals supporting a child will keep information about them and their families confidential. Young people can seek help on their own by ringing a helpline or approaching a professional directly. Still, they will usually need a parent’s consent for medical care if they’re under 16. Young people have a right to privacy if they don’t want to talk to their family about their conversations with professionals.

      / Families, children and young people Every child deserves the chance to grow up healthy, happy, safe, and supported.  Childhood health inequalities in Scotland are deeply unjust, but they are not inevitable. Scotland needs a bold, joined-up preventative policy approach, rooted in equity and empathy to effectively tackle these inequalities. The Mental Health Foundation Scotland has welcomed the publication of “A Connected Scotland”, the Scottish Government’s strategy to tackle loneliness and isolation, but has warned that urgent action must be taken to address mental health problems like depression and anxiety in both young people and older adults as a consequence of feeling lonely.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/a-z-topics/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-cbt,Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT),"This content mentions depression, anxiety and eating disorders, which some people may find triggering. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is based on the idea that our feelings, thoughts and actions are all connected. By changing one of these, we can change the others. When we’re upset, we often fall into patterns of negative thinking and responding that can make us feel worse. If we don’t challenge these negative thoughts and behaviours, they can become a cycle. For example, if you feel depressed, you may withdraw from your friends. You may think you’re no good or that you don’t deserve their friendship. This can make you feel more depressed, which makes you withdraw even further. In CBT, your therapist will help you notice and change how you think and behave so you can break this cycle and feel better. CBT usually takes place over a set number of sessions, often 6 to 20 weekly or fortnightly sessions. This might be delivered one-to-one or in a group with a therapist, via a self-help book or through an online CBT programme. CBT is different to other talking therapies in several ways. Not every session of CBT looks the same, but they tend to follow a similar structure. If you had any tasks to complete after your previous session, you’d look at how they went. If you weren’t able to complete them, let your therapist know so you can talk about what stopped you. Then you’ll decide what you want to focus on today. This might include recent problems, reflections on the previous session or planning for future events you might find difficult. Your therapist might give you exercises to do to explore your thoughts, feelings and behaviour. These could be worksheets, role plays or discussions. Based on what you’ve talked about, your therapist might suggest some more tasks to try. For example, if you’ve talked about feeling worried about letting your friends down, you might try saying ‘no’ to some small requests from them and seeing how that feels. Confronting your fears can be difficult, and your therapist won’t ask you to do things you don’t want to do. They should always work at your pace and check how you feel about your progress. CBT is one of the most common treatments offered for mental health problems. Evidence suggests it can be used to treatdepression,anxiety,obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD),eating disorders,post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),schizophreniaand more. It’s also sometimes used to help people withlong-term health conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or chronic fatigue syndrome. CBT can’t change someone’s physical symptoms, but it can help people cope better with them. While CBT can be helpful for many different people, it isn’t right for everyone – just like every treatment. Talk to your therapist about if you’re having CBT now and not finding it helpful. They may be able to help you get more from the sessions by making changes or trying a different approach. If you don’t feel comfortable with your therapist, you may be able to switch to a different one. Having a good relationship with your therapist is key to getting the most out of your sessions. Ask your doctor or whoever is providing your therapy about switching. It may be that CBT isn’t the right sort of therapy for you. Perhaps you need something long-term or look more at your past. Go back to your doctor or the organisation providing your therapy to ask about alternatives. Our page ontalking therapiescan help you think about what approach might be right for you. You can get CBT (along with other talking therapies) on the NHS, although there may be a long waiting list. You canrefer yourself directlyor ask your doctor for a referral.

Mental health problems can make earning and managing your money harder, and debt can trigger or worsen conditions such asanxiety,depressionandstress. There is a common misunderstanding that people find themselves in debt due to living an excessive lifestyle or going ‘wild in the aisles’ with credit cards. The truth is that unemployment and redundancy are the most common triggers for debt problems and can happen to anyone, no matter what their attitude to money may be. Life changessuch as losing your job, mental or physical health problems or separating from your partner can mean that you struggle to pay your household bills. Having to adjust to such a financial change can be difficult. There are many reasons why mental ill-health can make it hard to manage your money. If you’re depressed, you might not have the energy or motivation to keep track of your money. If you’re going through a manic episode, you may make rash or unwise decisions with your spending. If you need time off work or a hospital stay, you may be faced with a sudden reduction in income and difficulty keeping up with your bills. Some mental health problems (and conditions such asdementia) may make it difficult or impossible for you to make decisions about money. The ability to make decisions is known as mental capacity. Someone else may have to make decisions on your behalf if you don't have mental capacity. Our page onmental capacityhas more information, including ways to plan in case you become unable to make your own decisions. A study from the Royal College of Psychiatrists around Debt and mental healthfound that half of all adults with a debt problem also live with mental ill-health. This ranged from a consistent feeling of anxiety and low mood to a diagnosed mental health condition. Debt can make you feel anxious, especially if you don’t have support from friends or family or from your creditors. Debt can be a considerable burden, made worse by dealing with it alone. Worrying about debt can affect yoursleep. Losing out on a good night’s sleep can not only affect your mood and energy levels, it can also affect your ability to work or have good relationships with friends and family.

Dementia is a term used to describe a range of conditions that affect the brain. It’s caused when the brain is damaged by diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, or by a series of strokes. Dementia mainly affects people over 65, and the likelihood of developing it increases with age. If you, or someone you care about, has recently been diagnosed with dementia, you may feel overwhelmed by different emotions. You may be shocked, afraid of the future, or sad about changes you may have to make in your life or things you may miss out on. You may even feel relieved that your symptoms have an explanation. Whatever you’re going through, you don’t have to do it alone. Alzheimer’s UK has information onadjusting to your diagnosisas well asinformation and support for carers. Dementia affects everyone differently. It usually gets worse over time. Common symptoms include: For example, people with dementia may have mood changes, becoming irritable, tearful, anxious, depressed or agitated. In the later stages, they may experience physical symptoms such as muscle weakness, weight loss, and changes in appetite and sleeping habits. Some of these symptoms have other causes, such asstress,depression, dehydration or even a urinary tract infection.Speak to your doctorso you can get the right treatment. While there isn’t a cure for dementia, there are treatments that can help people live well with dementia. These includetalking therapies,cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), cognitive stimulation therapy to keep someone’s mind active, and medication that may help with the symptoms of dementia or stop them from progressing for a while. Alternative therapies such as music therapy, aromatherapy and reminiscence work can also help. The Alzheimer’s Society hasmore information about treatments.

Severe depression can lead to feeling hopeless and, in some cases, suicidal. If you’re depressed, you’re not alone. In England, 3 in every 100 people will experience depression in any given week. Even more – 8 in every 100 – will experience mixed depression andanxiety. (Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey: Mental Health and Wellbeing, England, 2014).

If you’ve felt depressed for a long time, you may feel like it’ll always be part of your life - but try to stay open to the possibility of change. There are many different types of help available now. A common treatment for depression involves a combination of self-help, talking therapies and medication.

Eating meals with other people has many psychological, social and biological benefits. They give us a sense of rhythm and regularity in our lives, a chance to reflect on the day and feel connected to others. Biologically, eating in upright chairs helps with our digestion. Talking and listening also slow us down, so we don’t eat too fast. Make the most of mealtimes by setting aside at least one day a week to eat with family and friends. Choose a meal that’s easy to prepare, so it doesn’t become a chore. Share responsibility, so everyone has a different task: doing the shopping, setting the table, cooking or washing up, for example. Keep the television off so you can all talk and share.

Being online can let you explore things at your own pace, at a time that suits you and with total anonymity if that’s important to you. It’s also important to get a balance between being online and offline. Make sure you have regular time to go outside, read a book or visit a friend, for example. If you feel like being online is making you feel worse, take a break or find offline mental health support instead. Perhaps the simplest way to get help online is by visiting trustworthy websites to find out more about mental health problems, symptoms and treatment options. Use reliable, evidence-based sources such asour A-Z pagesor the NHSEvery Mind Matterswebsite. Have a look at the links on our‘getting help with your mental health’ page, orask your GPfor recommendations.

When we talk about drugs on this page, we’re referring to recreational drugs such as cannabis, ecstasy, cocaine and heroin, as well asalcohol,tobaccoand some prescribed medicines if they are misused. Drugs may be legal, illegal or controlled substances (only legal if you have a prescription for them). People take drugs for many different reasons. You may begin out of curiosity, rebelliousness, or because your friends take them. You may enjoy taking them and want to repeat the experience. You may take drugs when you’re unhappy, stressed or trying to cope with problems in your life. If you have a mental health diagnosis, you may use drugs to help you cope with the symptoms. Drugs can act as a temporary prop to get you through difficult times. However, drugs can make difficult feelings and emotions even worse. And in the long term, any feelings of relief won’t last. You may find yourself using more and more drugs to deal with your problems and risk becoming dependent on them – which can create new problems for you. There are different ways drugs can affect your mental health. For some people, taking drugs can lead to long-term mental health problems. Regular cannabis use can increase your risk ofanxietyordepression. There’s also a link between using stronger cannabis and developingpsychosisorschizophrenia. The Rethink website has more information oncannabis and mental health. Stimulant drugs can make you feel depressed, anxious and paranoid. Cocaine – a type of stimulant – can make previous mental health problems recur and trigger psychosis and schizophrenia. Ecstasy users can experience memory problems. Hallucinogenic drugs such asmagic mushroomscan make any mental health issues worse. They can make you feel detached from your surroundings and cause flashbacks, which can be frightening or distressing. Mixing it with alcohol or drugs can be dangerous or even fatal if you take medication. Mind has more information about thepossible effects of mixing different drugs. You may feel you’re no longer in control of your drug use or need to take more of it to feel an effect. If so, you could be becoming addicted. Drug addiction is linked to mental health problems. Taking any drug can be dangerous. TheFrankwebsite has more information about how different drugs can affect your mental and physical health. If drug use affects your mental health, don’t be afraid to ask for help. You can either speak to your GP or contact alocal NHS drug treatment service. If you’re having trouble finding the right sort of help,visit the Frank websitefor free practical advice. Be honest about your drug use. It may be difficult to talk about, but your treatment is likely to be more successful if your doctor or support worker has all the information about what you take, how often and how it affects you. You may be offeredtalking therapy, such ascognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). It’s unlikely you’ll be offered medication for any mental health problems caused by your drug use. For example, antidepressants won’t help with depression caused by taking ecstasy, and anti-psychotics won’t help with psychosis caused by cannabis use. But if you already had a mental health problem before you started taking drugs, you may be given medication to treat it. You may be offered help from drug treatment services to stop taking drugs or alcohol. You may be given a 'dual diagnosis' if you have a severe mental health problem and misuse drugs. It may be that your mental ill-health led to your drug misuse or the other way round, or they might not have been related. If you have a dual diagnosis, mental health services should be in charge of your treatment rather than drug treatment services. They can refer you to other help you may need with housing, benefits or employment, for example. There may be a dual diagnosis team in your area. If not, ask your GP to refer you to your local community mental health team (CMHT). Some people with a dual diagnosis find it hard to get the help they need. For example, you may have been told that you can’t access mental health support because of your drug problem. However, the government guidance is clear: mental health services should try to help you if you have a drug problem. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) also says you shouldn’t be turned away from mental health support. If you’re turned away by your mental health team, ask why. Ask if they have an eligibility policy – you may be able to use this to show you qualify for help. Otherwise, go back to your GP and ask for help.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/a-z-topics/friendship-and-mental-health,Friendship and mental health,"Friendship is a crucial element in protecting our mental health. Our friends can keep us grounded, help us get things in perspective, and help us manage life's problems. “The best thing my friend did for me was that they just accepted me as I was.” If we’re experiencing a mental health problem, our instinct might be to hide away and avoid our friends. But friendships can play a key role in helping us live with or recover from a mental health problem and overcome the isolation that often comes with it. We can end up with the strongest relationships with the people who’ve supported us through hard times. “They kept coming to see me even though I didn’t seem to want them and they made me laugh.” Talking to friends about your mental health, and supporting a friend with a mental health problem, can be difficult to do. We have tips on how to start a conversation, offer support, and look after yourself. If you have a mental health problem, you may feel ashamed of ‘admitting’ to it. You may feel that you’re bothering or upsetting your friend, fear being labelled, or worry about how your friendship might change. You don’t have to tell your friends – and you certainly don’t have to tell everyone. Think about who you might feel comfortable talking to. It might help to write a list of the pros and cons of telling or not telling people about your problem. Tough as it can be, talking to close friends can be important for both of you. Even if you don’t talk about it again, having the issue out in the open means that you don’t have to worry about mentioning your mental health problem by accident or ‘explaining away’ medication or appointments. It may also clarify why you’re behaving in a particular way or don’t want to go out or talk to them much. “I wanted my friends to know so they...would cut me some slack if I behaved oddly.” You may want to practise your opening sentence or you may want to play it by ear. Choose a time and a place where you will both feel comfortable. Think about whether: You could phone or write to your friend if it’s easier than talking to them face to face. Understanding mental health problems can be difficult, despite how common they are. Be ready for your friend to be shocked or react badly. They may feel awkward and not know how to respond. This may be because they feel so worried about you, or perhaps your news has struck a chord with something in their own life. They may even suggest that you’re fine and just need to ‘pull yourself together'. Give them time to process what you’ve said. Most people don’t know very much about mental health issues so it may be a good idea to tell your friend about the problem itself but don’t overwhelm them. You could show them a book or website that’s helped you understand what you’re experiencing. If you don’t feel that turning to a friend is an option, there are other forms of informal help. Self-helpandpeer supportgroups are often useful. By sharing your experiences, you can support other people and learn about how they cope with challenging situations. You could join a group centred around an activity: a book group, a chess club or an exercise class. If you don’t want to join a group, try going to places where there are lots of people such as a library, leisure centre or café. You don’t have to talk to anyone if you don’t want to, but just being around other people can help you feel more connected. Online communities can also be supportive, whether or not they are focused on mental health problems. Mind’s online community,Side by Side, is where you can listen, share and be heard. If you’re a friend of someone with a mental health problem, you may be concerned about them. The most important thing is to show them that you’re still their friend and you care about them, whether that’s through your words, a hug, or another way that conveys how you feel. “My friend asked me questions, didn’t just assume things, she really wanted to know.” The most valuable support you can provide is just being there to talk and listen. Making time to call, text, visit or invite someone over can make a big difference. “My friend realised I had taken an overdose and rang for an ambulance... but has never judged me or criticised my action.” Mental health problems can be misunderstood. Simply acknowledging your friend’s problems, accepting them and treating them with compassion is important. Your friend isn’t looking for another mental health professional – they just want your support as a friend. They’re likely to want to keep things as normal as possible, even if you need to adapt some of the activities you used to do together (for example, because they feel anxious in big groups or their medication makes them tired in the evenings). “My friend phoned me, talked to me about normal stuff, sent me letters, took me out sometimes.” Remember that someone who insists they’re fine may be in a bad way. They may just need to talk, or they may need professional help. Men are often particularly reluctant to talk about emotional issues. The NHS offers advice forhelping others with mental health problems, which can be as simple as asking someone if they’re sure if they tell you they’re feeling fine. Practical help can be valuable too. Cleaning, shopping and basic household tasks can seem impossible to someone who is having a difficult time. Ask your friend what they need: it could be going to appointments with them, helping them manage their finances or finding information about therapies and services, for example. Some people reach the point where they feel they’ve become more of a carer instead of a friend. You may feel responsible for your friend and worry about what would happen if you weren’t around. It can be painful and embarrassing – on both sides – to admit that this is happening. But there are things you can do to look after yourself and rebalance the friendship. For example: “I gave my friend a lot of support and at times felt close to burning out. Now that my friend has recovered we are closer than before. However, I worry that I might not be able to cope with another episode.” Different types of peer support, what peer support can help with and how to find peer support.

Many different factors can increase your risk of developing a gambling problem, including: Gambling can cause low self-esteem,stress,anxietyanddepressionif gambling becomes a problem. Gambling can become an addiction, just like drugs or alcohol, if you use it compulsively or feel out of control. Gambling can affect the part of our brain that releases dopamine. A ‘feel good’ hormone that creates feelings of pleasure and reward. When we win a bet, our brain gives us an emotional reward. If you get addicted to gambling, other pleasurable activities may no longer make you feel good. So instead, you will gamble to get the same buzz. The good news is that your brain chemistry can change back. Everyday life can feel enjoyable again. There’s also a strong link between gambling problems and thoughts ofsuicide. If you have thoughts of ending your life or don’t feel you can keep yourself safe, call 999 or go to A&E immediately. If you have a mental health problem, you’re more at risk of harmful gambling. For example, you may gamble to feel better about yourself when you’re depressed or distract yourself if you’re angry or upset.

Talk to your doctorif you’re worried about how gambling affects your mental health. Gambling can be treated in the same way as other addictions, often withcognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). If you have a gambling problem, you tend to think differently about betting than others. For example, you may believe you’re more likely to win than you really are, that certain rituals can bring you luck, and that you can win back any losses by gambling more. CBT will look at these beliefs around betting as well as how you feel and behave when you want to gamble. You can also refer yourself to theNational Problem Gambling Clinicfor care and support.

While hearing voices can be a symptom of some mental health problems, not everyone who hears voices has a mental illness. Hearing voices is actually quite a common experience: around one in ten of us will experience it at some point in our lives. Hearing voices is sometimes called an ‘auditory hallucination’. Some people have other hallucinations, such as seeing, smelling, tasting or feeling things that don’t exist outside their mind. Whatever your experience, you’re not alone. Everyone’s experience of hearing voices is different. The voices can vary in how often you hear them, what they sound like, what they say, and whether they’re familiar or unfamiliar. Sometimes hearing voices can be upsetting or distressing. They may say hurtful or frightening things. However, some people's voices may be neutral or more positive. You may feel differently about your voices at different times in your life. It’s common to think that hearing voices must be a sign of a mental health condition, but many people who are not mentally unwell hear voices. People may hear voices because of: If you hear voices,talk to your GP.

Rethinkhas more information about the treatment you may be offered. Sometimes, voices are a problem because of your relationship with them. Changing your relationship can make you feel differently about them. Understanding your voices Understanding how your voices relate to your life may help you to manage their voices. This could include keeping a diary of your voices. You could note what they say, how they make you feel and how you manage them. This may help you to notice patterns of what makes you feel bad, what makes you feel good, or what triggers your voices. Taking control Some people find that standing up to the voices, choosing when to pay attention to them and when to ignore them, and focusing on more positive voices can help them feel more in control. Talking therapy can help you with this, as it can be difficult on your own. Keeping busy Keeping busy can distract you from the voices, help you express yourself, feel more relaxed, and allow you to meet new people. You could try listening to music or audiobooks, keeping up with hobbies or doing something creative such as writing or painting. Sharing your experiences There can be astigmaaround hearing voices, making it hard to talk about them, even to friends or family.

It means all public authorities – including the government, police, NHS and local authorities – must treat everyone equally, with dignity, fairness and respect. The Human Rights Act legally protects your human rights. There are 16 rights in total, and each one is referred to as an ‘article’. For example, article 10 is the right to freedom of expression. You’re protected under the Human Rights Act if you live in the UK, including if you’re a foreign national or a child detained in a hospital or prison. If a public authority doesn’t respect your human rights, you can bring a claim against them. The Human Rights Act doesn’t apply to individuals or private companies such as employers. If you feel your employer has discriminated against you, read our page onstigma and discrimination. All public authorities or bodies carrying out public functions need to follow the Human Rights Act. These include: If you have a mental health problem, the Human Rights Act means staff and service providers should treat you with dignity and respect. Mental health, social services and emergency services staff must comply with your human rights. If you’re detained under the Mental Health Act (‘sectioned’), knowing your rights can be a way to question and change how you’re looked after. There are 16 rights or articles in the Human Rights Act. We’ve looked at the most important ones for people with mental health problems. This means that nobody, including the state, can try to end your life. The government must make laws to protect you and, in some circumstances, protect you if your life is at risk. It also means the government must investigate suspicious deaths and deaths in custody. Hospitals must take steps to protect your life. If you’re a patient at risk of attempting suicide, the hospital must ensure you don’t have access to the means to do this. They must ensure you can’t easily leave the building if you're detained under the Mental Health Act. You should never be tortured or treated in an inhuman or degrading way. This means, in a way, that it causes intense physical or mental suffering. This could include police violence, poor prison conditions, or neglect or abuse in a care home. In one case, the European Court ruled that giving a patient a cheaper psychiatric drug with worse side effects than a more expensive one was inhuman treatment. Being restrained isn’t generally seen as torture unless too much force is used, or it’s used to limit your movements beyond keeping you safe. We all have the right to personal freedom: to move around and not to be locked indoors. However, there are times when this right can be taken away: if we’re arrested, imprisoned or detained under the Mental Health Act. If you think you’ve been detained unlawfully, you can use article 5 to challenge it. This could be if the correct procedures weren’t followed or you’ve been detained for longer than the law allows, for example. Everyone has the right to a fair hearing. A fair hearing must be independent, impartial and heard within a reasonable time. This applies to: You have the right to: Private life has a broad meaning. It means you can live your life with privacy and without interference from the state.

This doesn’t mean mental ill-health is inevitable, though. There is support available, as well as things you can do to help yourself. Long-term physical conditions are those which can’t currently be cured but can be managed with medication or other treatment. They are also known as chronic conditions. Examples include diabetes, asthma, arthritis, epilepsy, chronic fatigue, and high blood pressure. More than 15 million people in England have one or more long-term physical conditions.They’re more common in older people (58% of people over 60 compared to 14% of people under 40) and in more deprived groups, but anyone can be affected. You may find having a long-term physical condition affects many areas of your life, including your relationships, your ability to work, your finances and your mental health. Having a long-term physical condition can lead tosocial isolation, low self-esteem,stigma and discrimination. You may feel tired, frustrated, worried orstressed, especially when dealing with pain, tests, treatments or flare-ups. All of these things can make you more likely to develop a mental health problem such asdepressionoranxiety. In fact, research shows that people with long-term physical conditions are more than twice as likely to develop mental ill-health. Mental health problems can then make it harder for you to cope with your physical health condition. You don’t have to just accept mental health problems as part of having a long-term condition.Speak to your GPabout how you’re feeling and ask about different treatments to find one that’s right for you. Our page onphysical health and mental healthhas ideas on how you might be able to help yourself, although some of these things might feel more difficult if you’re physically unwell. You may also find the following helpful when dealing with a long-term health condition: Some symptoms of a long-term condition, such as tiredness and pain, aren’t always visible. Other people might not realise what you’re going through. If you can, talk to someone you trust about how you’re feeling and what support you need.

It's important you feel supported and understood by your GP, especially if you need to visit them regularly: considerswitching GPs or making a complaint if you don’t.

If you’re in pain,cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)may help you change how you think, feel and behave about it. It can help you manage your pain better and feel more in control, even if your level of pain doesn’t change. Ask your GP if they can refer you. NHS Inform has anonline self-help guide for chronic pain. Having reliable information about your condition, treatment and management can help you feel more positive and in control.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/a-z-topics/medication-mental-health-problems,Medication for mental health problems,"Medication can be a way to get through a crisis or a long-term treatment. You might take it to treat or reduce the symptoms of your mental illness or stop them from coming back. There are four main types of medication for mental health problems. It’s easy to get confused when talking about mental health medication because the same drug may be known by several different names. These are: For example, diazepam (generic name) belongs to the benzodiazepine (chemical group name) family. It may be sold under the trade name Valium. Your doctor will consider a number of things when deciding which medication to prescribe. These include: It’s not possible to predict which medication is right for you before you try it. Some drugs work better for some people than others, and it may take time to find the right drug and dose for you. If your doctor has suggested you take medication, don’t hesitate to ask questions. We’ve listed some examples below but ask about anything important to you. Tell your doctor about any other medication you take, including any over-the-counter or herbal remedies. They may interact with the medication you’ve been prescribed. Let them know about any other mental or physical health problems you have, as well as any previous experience of taking mental health medication. After you start taking medication, you should have regular reviews with your doctor or psychiatrist so you can talk about how you’re finding it. They should ask how you’re feeling, if you feel the medication is working, and any side effects you’re experiencing. You don’t have to wait for a review if you have questions about your medication though – get in touch with your doctor at any time. You can also contact the people or use the resources listed in 'How can I find out more about my medication?' to find the answers. You can find out more about your medication from: In most cases, you can’t be forced to take medication. You have the right to refuse it and ask for an alternative treatment. There are some circumstances where you can be given medication even if you haven’t agreed to it. These are: If you don’t find your medication helpful, you may want to stop taking it. Or perhaps the side effects are worse than any benefits you’re getting from it, or you’ve found another way to cope with your symptoms, such astalking therapyorexercise. Or you may have been feeling better for a long time and want to try coming off your medication. Whatever your reasons, talk to your doctor first and make a plan. It’s important to reduce your dose over time slowly. Stopping suddenly can increase your risk of withdrawal symptoms and can even be dangerous for some medications. Slowly reducing your dose also gives you time to adjust to being without your medication and see how you feel without it.

The eating disorder charityBeatestimates that around 1.25 million people in the UK have an eating disorder. Anyone can develop an eating disorder, no matter what their age, gender, race or weight. You might be surprised to learn that around 25% of those with an eating disorder are male, and most people with an eating disorder are not underweight. There are several types of eating disorders, including: If your symptoms don’t exactly fit the symptoms for any of these three eating disorders, you may be diagnosed with an ‘other specified feeding or eating disorder’ (OSFED). OSFED is the most common eating disorder. Find out more about OSFED from the eating disorder charity Beat If you or the people around you are worried you have an unhealthy relationship with food, you could have an eating disorder. Some common symptoms of eating disorders include: There is no single cause of eating disorders. Many specialists believe they develop because of a mixture of factors. These include: Our pages onanorexiaandbulimiahave more information about the causes. Recovery is possible, even if it doesn’t feel like it right now. Recovery might even feel scary, especially if your eating disorder has become a strong part of your identity or you’re worried about your weight or diet changes. Think about what recovery might look like for you and what the benefits could be. It’s never too soon or too late to ask for help: it’s out there once you’re ready. If you’re worried you may have an eating disorder,contact your GP.Your GP may not be an expert in treating eating disorders, but they will be able to assess any physical symptoms and then refer you to specialist eating disorder services. There are lots of different ways that eating disorders are treated. The most appropriate for you will depend on your type of eating disorder, how severe it is, and your personal circumstances and preferences. Talking therapyinvolves working through your thoughts, feelings and behaviours with a mental health professional in regular sessions over a set period. Different kinds of talking therapy are available for treating and managing eating disorders. These includecognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), family therapy or psychotherapy. During your therapy sessions, you may agree on an eating plan to ensure you get the appropriate vitamins and minerals from your diet. Your GP may also conduct an X-ray to check your bone health if you have been underweight for a prolonged period, which can lead to low bone strength. You may be offered a guided self-help programme if you have bulimia or a binge eating disorder. This involves completing exercises in a workbook alongside having short sessions with a practitioner. If someone you care about has an eating disorder or is starting to show some of the symptoms, encourage them to see their GP and perhaps offer to go along with them. It can be helpful to let them know they are valued, that you support them and are willing to listen to them without judgement or criticism.

While all this can paint a gloomy picture, help and support are available if you’re worried about your own or someone else’s mental health. Society's expectations and traditional gender roles play a role in why men are less likely to discuss or seek help for their mental health problems. We know that gender stereotypes about women – the idea they should behave or look a certain way, for example – can be damaging to them. But it’s important to understand that stereotypes and expectations can also damage men. Men are often expected to be the breadwinners and to be strong, dominant and in control. While these aren’t inherently bad things, they can make it harder for men to reach out for help and open up. Men may also be more likely to use potentially harmful coping methods such as drugs or alcohol and less likely to talk to family or friends about their mental health. However,research suggests men will get the help that meets their preferences and is easy to access, meaningful and engaging. For example,Men’s Shedsprovides community spaces for men to connect and chat, often over practical activities. While there isn’t a different sort of ‘male depression’, some symptoms are more common in men than women. These include irritability, sudden anger, increased loss of control, risk-taking and aggression.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/a-z-topics/menopause,Menopause,"Your experience of the menopause will be affected by many different things, not just what’s happening in your body. Menopause may be one of manysignificant events happening in your life, such as your children leaving home or your parents needing more care. You may still be working full-time and having to juggle these new responsibilities. Cultural differences can shape how you’re affected by the menopause too. Research shows that in societies where older people are respected, menopause symptoms are often less troublesome; but where younger women are admired more highly, going through menopause can feel like a time of loss and be less valued by society. Menopause symptoms for these women can feel much worse. However you feel about the menopause, you may find physical symptoms such as mood changes and hot flushes hard to manage. Don’t be afraid to talk about it and ask for help if needed. The menopause is a natural biological process. Put simply, the menopause is when you stop having periods and are no longer able to get pregnant naturally. It happens when your ovaries age and naturally produce lower levels of reproductive hormones. If you’ve had a hysterectomy and had your ovaries removed, you will immediately reach menopause. This is known as surgical menopause and can happen to women of any age. We often use the word menopause to describe when we notice our periods changing, and we start to experience menopausal symptoms, which is called perimenopause. The menopause itself is defined as the day when you haven’t had a period for 12 months. The average age of menopause is 51 but it may happen sooner or later than this.Around one in 100 women experience the menopause before they reach 40. The perimenopause is the time when your body starts transitioning towards the menopause, and your ovaries slow down. It can start months or years before the menopause. You might experience irregular periods that are lighter or heavier than normal, hot flushes, mood swings, sleep problems and fatigue. Eight out of ten women have symptoms in addition to their periods stopping. The type and severity of symptoms can vary, and some are the same as the symptoms that can occur during the perimenopause. Common menopausal symptoms include: It can be helpful to track your symptoms, so you can monitor how you're feeling and keep an eye on patterns. The Menopause Charity has a symptom checker, and lots more information and advice. Read more about menopause symptoms If you’re trans, how the menopause affects you will depend on which medical interventions you’ve undergone and whether or not you’re taking hormones.Speak to your doctorif you have any questions or concerns.Rock My Menopausehas some information about themenopause and trans people. Changing hormone levels can cause mood swings, low mood andanxietyaround menopause. For some women, these are the first signs that they are approaching menopause. Self-help measures such as getting enoughsleep,eating well, taking regularexerciseand practising yoga or meditation may help. You might also want to speak to your doctor about getting help. They may suggesttalking therapy,medicationor both. The low mood you may experience with menopause is different from depression. NICE (the organisation that produces guidelines for healthcare professionals) is clear that you shouldn’t be offered antidepressants as the first line of treatment. Your changing hormones cause mood changes, so hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can help. However, you may be prescribed a low dose of antidepressants to help with hot flushes and night sweats. Read more about antidepressants and menopause While the menopause isn’t a mental health condition, it can affect your mental health. Hormone changes during the menopause can sometimes make mental health conditions worse. Not all women are affected butspeak to your doctorif you find your mental health condition harder to manage. Changes to your treatment may help you feel better. Speak to your doctorif your menopause symptoms are affecting your life. You don’t just have to put up with them – there is help available. The main therapy is hormone replacement therapy (HRT). This replaces the hormones that are reducing your body and is very effective at relieving menopause symptoms. It can also help with thinning of the bones, which is more common after the menopause. There’s no limit on how long you can take HRT, but most women stop taking it after their symptoms stop – usually after a few years. You may find your menopause symptoms come back for a while after stopping HRT. If they’re severe, speak to your doctor about managing them. As with all medication, you must weighthe benefits and risks of taking HRT. Some women and doctors have been reluctant to use HRT because of studies that have focused on the potential risks. However, recent evidence shows the risks are very small and usually outweighed by the benefits. Talk to your doctor about any concerns. It’s always your choice whether to take medication or not. Some women prefer not to take HRT and to manage their symptoms in other ways until this stage in their lives has passed. Talking therapy, such ascognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), can help with low mood,anxiety,stressand even hot flushes and night sweats.

Most older people don’t develop mental health problems, and there is help available if you do. If you’re struggling to manage or not feeling like yourself, you don’t have to put up with it. Some of the changes that can come with later life can affect our mental health. For many of us, work can bring a sense of purpose and boost our self-esteem. It can also bring friendships, give our days structure and – of course – provide financial security. Even if you’ve looked forward to retiring, it can come with a sense of loss. You can find you’re struggling to understand who you are now, especially if work gave you a strong sense of identity. If you have a partner, your relationship may change if you’re both adjusting to you spending more time at home. You may feel lonely if you enjoyed the social side of work. There are things you can do to make retirement easier. The death of someone close to you can be devastating. Grief affects us all differently.

Anyone can have OCD. It typically starts during early adulthood but can begin at any age. It can be distressing, time-consuming and interfere with your daily life. OCD involves both obsessions and compulsions. Obsessions are unwanted and unpleasant thoughts or images which come into your mind repeatedly. They can feel like a stuck record, and trying to resist them can make them worse. Compulsions are repetitive actions or thoughts you feel you must do, often until they feel‘right’. The aim of a compulsion is to try to relieve the anxiety or distress caused by obsessive thoughts. Common obsessions include: Compulsions commonly involve: Compulsions can be very time-consuming but usually only provide temporary relief from anxiety. OCD may make you feel scared, disgusted, tearful ordepressed. You may worry you’re going mad or that you’re a bad person because of the thoughts you have. Recognising that OCD is nothing to be embarrassed or ashamed about is important. Effective treatments can reduce the impact it has on your life. While the exact causes of OCD aren’t yet fully understood, many different factors can likely lead to it. These include: We all have worries and anxieties at times and may have mild compulsions or superstitions (such as not stepping on the cracks in the pavement). However, if your thoughts or compulsions seem excessive, cause you distress or affect your ability to carry out your daily life, it’s important to ask for help. OCD rarely goes away by itself, but there are effective treatments. Start by talking to your GP. They may offer you talking therapy, medication or both. Or you may be referred to a specialist OCD service if your OCD is severe. The right help for you will depend on how intense your OCD is and how much it affects your life. Your GP may offer you self-help resources such as books from the Reading Well scheme called‘Books on Prescription’. You can find these books yourself in a library or bookshop – you don’t actually need a prescription for them. OCD-UK has arange of self-help resources, including books, discussion forums and online courses. Your GP can refer you for therapy, oryou can refer yourself. Therapy for OCD is usually a type ofCognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). There are two types of CBT used with OCD. You may be offered a type of antidepressant called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). This can improve OCD symptoms by increasing the level of serotonin in your brain. If your OCD is severe and talking therapy and medication haven’t worked, you may be referred to a specialist service. OCD-UK hasmore information about these services. OCD support groups can help you to feel less alone and gain reassurance and advice from other people with OCD. You can find local support groups viaOCD Action,OCD-UKandTOP UK.

When you have a panic attack, your body can react differently. You may experience: This can all be frightening, but remember that panic attacks aren’t dangerous and will pass. Panic attacks usually last between 5 and 20 minutes. Symptoms usually peak within 10 minutes and then start to fade. If it lasts for longer, you may be having multiple panic attacks (although this is rare), or you may be experiencing other symptoms ofanxiety. You may be diagnosed with panic disorder if you’re having lots of panic attacks for no obvious reason. This is a type ofanxiety disorder. You might feel worried about going out in public because you’re afraid of having another panic attack. If this fear becomes intense, it may be agoraphobia. The NHS website has more information aboutagoraphobia. As with many mental health conditions, the exact cause of panic disorder is not fully understood. But it's thought to be linked to a combination of things, including: When you feel a panic attack coming on, there are some quick strategies you can try: If you have a friend with you, it can be helpful to tell them what’s happening. They can reassure you it will pass and that the symptoms won’t hurt you. Small changes can help prevent further panic attacks: Speak to your GPif you’re experiencing panic attacks. They may examine you to rule out other conditions that could be causing the symptoms. Treatment for panic attacks aims to reduce the number of attacks you have and ease your symptoms. Your treatment will depend on your symptoms. Your GP may offer you self-help resources such as workbooks or online CBT courses. Your GP can refer you fortalking therapy, oryou can refer yourself. You may be offered: You may be offeredmedicationto help with your symptoms.

Many parents with mental health problems can care for their children in a safe and loving way. But sometimes, you might need extra support from family, friends or healthcare professionals to get you through difficult times. There’s no shame in needing extra help as a parent, whatever the reasons for it. All parents face challenges, but you may face additional difficulties if you have a mental health problem. Mental health problems can vary in terms of how severe they are and how they affect you. You may need regular extra support or be fine for long stretches and have periods when you need more help. Or otherstressful life experiencesmay make things more challenging: for example, money problems or a relationship breakdown can negatively affect your mental health. When you’re unwell, you may find it difficult to: You may also experiencestigma or discriminationfrom other people making assumptions or judgements about mental health. You might need to ask your children for help, for example, with getting younger siblings ready for school or doing housework. This can make you feel guilty and may affect the amount of free time they have. It can be hard to seek help as a parent. You might worry about being judged or tell yourself you have to keep going on your own. Try not to put pressure on yourself to be a ‘perfect parent’. Remember, all parents have hard times, and there’s no shame in needing extra support. Some of these ideas may help: It can be hard to ask for help like this, and you may be afraid your children will be taken into care. This only happens in very exceptional cases whether neither you nor your partner, if you have one, can safely care for your children. Asking for help means you’re doing the best for your family and shows that you’re a good parent. Your local authority will have supported lots of parents before you and will be experienced in the best ways to help you and your family. Asking for support could be a positive experience for you all. Mind has more information ongetting help from your local authority.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/a-z-topics/peer-support,Peer support,"This content discusses death or bereavement, depression, anxiety and substance abuse or addiction (which may include mentions of alcohol or drug use), which some people may find triggering. There are different types of peer support, but they all involve both giving and receiving support. This could be sharing knowledge or providing emotional support, social interaction or practical help. Everyone’s experiences are treated as equally important, and no one is more of an expert than anyone else. How much help you give and receive will depend on what feels right for you at different times. Research shows that peer support can improve people’s well-being, meaning they have fewer hospital stays, larger support networks, and better self-esteem, confidence and social skills. There are many different types of peer support. Some examples include: Peer support can take many forms. It may be for particular groups of people (with a specific health condition or from a certain ethnic group, for instance). It could be provided face-to-face, on the phone or online. It may be weekly, monthly, ongoing or for a limited time. Peer support programmes can help with various issues, including: Some NHS services run peer support groups.Ask your GPor other healthcare professional about this. Many local Minds offer peer support. Visit theirpeer support directoryto find out what’s available in your area. Rethinkhas peer support groups run by volunteers who often have lived experience of mental illness. They can help you feel more confident, informed and in control of your life. Some meet for mutual support, while others offer activities such as art or sport. Together UKruns peer support groups. Contact your local one to find out if you need a referral or can self-refer. Also, check your local library or community centre message board - local groups may put flyers up there. Some peer support services are aimed at people with mental health conditions or who are part of particular communities. Befriending Networkslists peer support groups for specific groups of people, including people from BAME communities, older people, disabled people, single parents and more. Mind has an online community,Side By Side, where you can talk about your mental health and connect to others who understand what you’re going through. Togetherallis an online community for people with anxiety, depression and other mental health problems. You may need an access code to register, or your local council or healthcare provider may have already signed up. Before finding peer support, you might want to consider whether it’s right for you. It’s normal to find it difficult to open up, and you may feel nervous about sharing your experiences with others. Remember, they probably feel or felt the same way you do. You can choose how much to share with them. Think about how you’re feeling at the moment. Could it be difficult to hear about other people’s experiences? While it can be helpful to hear how other people have coped, there might be times when it’s triggering or upsetting for you. Peer support is very different from the tailored help you might get from your GP or counsellor. Remember that you’ll hear people’s personal experiences and strategies and that what worked for them may not be right for you. Think about what you want to get from peer support. Different support groups will offer different things. So if you don’t want to sit and talk about how you’re feeling, try to find a group that offers an activity instead. Don’t be afraid to ask questions before joining. For example, you may want to know how the sessions are structured, what you might be asked to do, how many people attend, and who leads the group. You could ask if you can bring someone with you, particularly if you’re nervous about joining a group for the first time. If peer support doesn’t work for you, that’s ok. It doesn’t mean you’ve done anything wrong. It might just not be the right support for you now. You could always try again in future or find a different type of support that helps you.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/a-z-topics/personality-disorders,Personality disorders,"This content mentions suicide or suicidal thoughts, self-harm, personality disorders, abuse or violence, trauma, depression and substance abuse or addiction (which may include mentions of alcohol or drug use). Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. Our personality is the ways we think, feel and behave that make us who we are. For most of us, this remains fairly consistent. However, people with a personality disorder have significant difficulties in how they think and feel about themselves and others. These difficulties affect their well-being, mental health and relationships with others. Around one in 20 people in the UK has a personality disorder. They can be hard to define and diagnose, so they often go unrecognised for a long time. A personality disorder affects how you cope with life, manage emotions and connect with other people. You may find that your beliefs and attitudes are different from most people who may find your behaviour unusual, unexpected or upsetting at times. You may have difficulties with: These symptoms often get worse withstress. As a result, you may feel isolated and alone. You may try to cope throughself-harm,drugoralcoholuse orsuicideattempts. You may also experience other mental health conditions, such asdepression. There are ten types of personality disorders. They are organised into three groups based on similar symptoms. We all experience these symptoms from time to time. However, if you have a personality disorder, you’ll find these symptoms are making your life difficult. Your symptoms may not fit exactly into one group. You may see aspects of yourself in more than one category. This isn’t unusual: it can be hard to diagnose a particular personality disorder clearly. The three groups of personality disorders are described as A, B and C. We've briefly described them below:Mindhas more information about symptoms and types. You may have difficulty forming relationships with other people and think or behave very differently from others. An example is a paranoid personality disorder, where you may feel suspicious of others for no reason and believe people are being nasty to you. You might hold a grudge or feel easily rejected. You may find it hard to manage your emotions and swing between positive and negative views of other people. You may behave in a way others describe as dramatic, disturbing or unpredictable. An example is borderline personality disorder (also known as an emotionally unstable personality disorder). You might have intense emotions that change quickly, worries about being abandoned, act impulsively and struggle to trust other people. You may not have a strong sense of who you are or what you want. You may self-harm or have suicidal thoughts. You may have feelings of fear or anxiety that are so overwhelming they affect your daily life or relationships. An example is an avoidant personality disorder, where you may fear being judged negatively and feel uncomfortable in social situations. You may worry a lot and have low self-esteem. You might feel lonely but avoid relationships because you fear rejection. There can be a stigma around personality disorders. Some people feel that the term ‘personality disorder’ is judgemental as it can sound like there is something wrong with who you are. This can be upsetting and feel insulting. Other people should focus more on why they feel or act in a certain way rather than having a label placed on their personality. The term can also have negative associations with violent or anti-social behaviour. However, most people with a personality disorder are far more likely to harm themselves than someone else. Our page onstigmahas ways you can challenge these beliefs in others if you feel able to. Personality disorders are complex, and what causes them isn’t fully known. Most researchers believe a combination of factors can increase the risk of developing one, including: Not everyone who experiences trauma will develop a personality disorder. And not everyone with a personality disorder will have had a traumatic experience. There may be no clear reason why you’ve developed your feelings and symptoms. The first step to getting support is tospeak to your GP. They will probably refer you to a specialist who can do an in-depth assessment and diagnose you. With help, it is possible for things to change and improve for you. It may take time, but life can become more fulfilling and less difficult. The right treatment for you will depend on the type of difficulties you have, what’s available locally and what your preferences are. You may be offeredtalking therapy,medicationor a stay in a therapeutic community. NICE – the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence – suggests the following talking therapies may be useful for personality disorders: Other therapies that can help include: There isn’t currently a specific medication for treating personality disorders. However, NICE guidance suggests medication can be used to treat other mental health problems you may experience, such asdepression,anxietyorpsychosis. Therapeutic communities are places you can visit or stay for several weeks or months. They offer a form of group therapy where you can explore what it’s like to have a personality disorder. You learn from spending time with other people in the group and supporting each other’s recovery.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/a-z-topics/pets-and-mental-health,Pets and mental health,"A pet can be a great source of comfort and motivation. In many ways, pets can help us to live mentally healthier lives. Caring for a pet can help our mental health in many ways, including: Pets may also help with specific conditions. For example, people withADHDmay benefit from the structure and routine that a pet needs. Managing their pet’s responsibilities and keeping track of time – to feed or walk them on time, for example – may help them in other areas of their lives. Some people with ADHD are hyperactive – especially children – and playing with a pet can be a great way to release excess energy, whether that’s walking a dog or running around with a kitten. Autistic peoplecan benefit from having a pet. Pets provide the kind of unconditional relationship that can help someone build social skills and confidence. They can provide a sense of calm and reassurance if their owner feels overwhelmed. Autistic children with sensory issues can involve their pets in sensory integration activities to help them get used to how something feels against their skin or how it smells or sounds. Having a pet is a serious commitment and not something to do on a whim. You'll need to have the time, money and energy for a pet, as well as a calm home environment with routine and consistency. Fostering a pet or helping a friend with theirs can help you see whether having your own is right for you. When you’re ready to think about getting a pet, consider: Animal charity PDSA has otherkey things to think about before you get a pet. If you can’t afford a pet, live somewhere you’re not allowed one, or you’re worried about having times where you’re too unwell to care for a pet, there are other options. The simplest option may be spending time with friends’ pets, whether that’s walking their dogs, stroking their cats or cuddling their guinea pigs. They might be glad to have someone to pet sit for them while they’re on holiday. You can also consider signing up as a house-sitter: you look after someone's home, garden and pets in return for free accommodation.

Physical activity is not only good for your body, but it's also great for your mind. Being active releases chemicals in your brain that make you feel good - boosting your self-esteem and helping you concentrate as well assleepwell and feel better. Not bad for something many of us can do for free! Being active doesn’t have to mean taking out an expensive gym membership or running marathons. Finding an activity you enjoy can give you a goal to aim for and a sense of purpose. It can also be a great way to meet people, have a break from daily life and gain confidence. Other benefits include: It’s even better if you’re able to get active outdoors. Research shows that being innaturecan make us feel happier, feel our lives are more worthwhile, and reduce our levels of depression and anxiety. Nature doesn’t have to mean forests or national parks either: walking to a local common, visiting a friend’s garden or simply noticing trees and flowers planted by the roadside can boost your mental well-being. For some of us, it can be hard to be active, perhaps because we have a mental or physical disability or health condition. Our tips below on things to consider before starting exercise may help. The NHS has advice aboutgetting active if you have a disability or health condition, with tips on building activity into your day and finding accessible activities and classes. Exercising with a disability can be frustrating if you’re not able to do the type of activity you want or are used to be able to do, but it’s important to work with your body. Any amount of physical activity is better than none. Finding an activity you like and are able to do regularly is more important than pushing yourself to do something you don’t enjoy. You could try brisk walking, mowing the lawn, dancing, swimming, following an exercise video or online class, trying a new sport or anything that gets your body moving. Government guidelines suggest adults aim to do 150 minutes of moderate activity a week or 75 minutes of vigorous activity a week. The NHS website hasdifferent examples of activities you could tryas well asfree online exercise videos. This might sound like a lot, but don’t be put off if you don’t feel you can manage this now. Start small and build up slowly if you don’t do much physical activity. The guidelines also suggest doing strength-building exercises at least two days a week. This could be yoga, pilates, weight lifting, wheeling a wheelchair, or carrying heavy shopping bags. Think about your current fitness levels, how much time you have to exercise, and what feels realistic to you. Anything you do to get active and reduce the amount of time you spend sitting or lying down is good. Remember that exercise isn’t about losing weight or changing your body shape. If you enjoy it and it makes you feel good, that’s important. If you have a mental health condition, there may be factors that affect the amount or type of physical activity you can do. Here are some things you may need to consider. Certain medications can affect the exercise you can do. For example, taking beta-blockers will mean your heart works harder when exercising, so you may need to adjust the type or amount of exercise you do. If you take lithium, losing fluid from your body through sweating can increase the concentration of lithium in your blood to a harmful level. Talk to your doctor before you start exercising or if you change your medication. Work with your body and your mood. For example, if you know your medication makes you feel tired in the mornings, plan to get active later in the day. If you feel unmotivated all day, try just going for a walk. Even a short walk can clear your mind and boost your energy level. If there are times when you just don’t have the motivation or energy to exercise, be kind to yourself. It’s ok to slow down, do less or take a break. Do what you can, when you can. While exercise can be a positive part of recovery, some people with an eating disorder find they are over-exercising.Talk to your GPbefore starting to get active. How you feel when you get active – breathless, hot, sweaty, a fast heart rate – can feel similar to the symptoms of anxiety or panic attacks. This can be distressing and may then cause a panic attack or increased anxiety. If this happens to you, try a lower-impact activity such as yoga or pilates. When this feels ok, build up the intensity slowly and notice the difference between the effects of physical activity and a panic attack. Exercising with someone else may help you feel reassured that help is available if you feel anxious.

Physical health problems significantly increase our risk of developing mental health problems, and vice versa. Nearly one in three people with a long-term physical health condition also has a mental health problem, most often depression or anxiety. Research shows that people with a mental health problem are more likely to have a preventable physical health condition such as heart disease. This can be for a variety of reasons, including: As well as this, mental health problems can come with physical symptoms. Our bodies and minds are not separate, so it’s not surprising that mental ill health can affect your body.Depressioncan come with headaches, fatigue and digestive problems, andanxietycan create an upset stomach, for example. Other symptoms can include insomnia, restlessness and difficulty concentrating. Having a mental health problem doesn’t mean it’s inevitable that you will develop a physical health problem. There are things you can do to give yourself the best chance of staying physically well. Physical activityis a great way to keep you physically healthy as well as improving your mental wellbeing. Research shows that doing exercise releases feel-good chemicals called endorphins in the brain. Even a short burst of 10 minutes brisk walking can improve your mental alertness, energy and mood. Whether you’re tending your garden or running a marathon, exercise can significantly improve your quality of life. Finding an activity you enjoy can make you feel less stressed, more focused, and give you a sense of purpose. For more tips on ways to get started, read our guide onhow to look after your mental health using exercise. Eating well can improve your wellbeing and your mood.A balanced dietis one that includes healthy amounts of proteins, essential fats, complex carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals and water. The food we eat can influence the development, management and prevention of numerous mental health conditions including depression anddementia. Smokinghas a negative impact on both mental and physical health. Many people with mental health problems believe that smoking relieves their symptoms, but these effects are only short-term. It’s never too late to quit, and there is now a lot of support available to help you give up. If you’re worried about your physical health, or you’ve been invited for a routine check or screening, make an appointment to see your GP. Waiting times will be different at different GP surgeries: ask for an emergency appointment if you need to see someone urgently. If you find it hard to talk to healthcare professionals or are worried you won’t be listened to, you could bring someone to help you assert yourself.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/a-z-topics/postnatal-depression,Postnatal depression,"This content mentions abuse or violence, trauma, depression and anxiety, which some people may find triggering. Having a baby is a huge life event. It’s normal to experience a range of powerful emotions while you’re pregnant and after giving birth: excitement, joy, and anxiety. You may also feel depressed. It’s not a sign of weakness or anything to feel guilty about. With support and treatment, you can get better. While most people have heard of postnatal depression, it’s also possible to experience antenatal depression while you’re pregnant. Some people experience both. The term ‘perinatal depression’ covers depression at any time, from getting pregnant to around a year after giving birth. We’ve used the term ‘postnatal depression’ on this page as it’s more well known, but the symptoms and treatment for antenatal or perinatal depression are the same. The ‘baby blues’ is a brief period of feeling low, emotional and tearful after giving birth. It doesn’t last for more than two weeks after giving birth. If your symptoms last longer or start later, you could have postnatal depression. It can start any time in the year after giving birth and may begin gradually or suddenly. It can range from mild to severe. It might be difficult to talk about how you’re feeling. You may feel people expect you to be happy or worry you’re a bad parent if you tell someone you’re depressed. Remember that postnatal depression can happen to anyone and isn’t your fault. It’s never too early or late to get help. The symptoms of postnatal depression are similar to the symptoms ofdepression. They include: You may feel detached from your baby or partner. You may even have thoughts of hurting yourself or your baby. It can be very frightening to have thoughts of harming your baby but remember, this doesn’t mean you’re actually going to hurt them. The sooner you can talk to someone about your thoughts and feelings – a friend, relative, doctor or midwife, for instance – the sooner you can get the help you need. Only people who have given birth in the last year can be formally diagnosed with postnatal depression, but evidence suggests partners can also experienceanxietyordepression. This is a huge life change for them too, and dealing with a lack of sleep, extra household responsibilities and financial worries, for example, can be very difficult. Help and support are available, either through their GP or specialist organisations such as theNational Childbirth Trust, theFatherhood InstituteorPANDAS. There are many reasons why someone can develop postnatal depression. These include: For many people, a combination of factors causes postnatal depression. If you’ve experienced mental health problems in the past,tell your GP, health visitor and/or midwife. They can support you during and after pregnancy. Being depressed doesn’t mean you’re a bad parent or that you’re going mad. Some people worry it will mean their baby will be taken away from them. Remember that asking for help means you’re doing the best for your baby: it’s good parenting. Healthcare professionals will want to support you so you can look after your baby. Children are only taken into care in very exceptional circumstances. If you have symptoms of postnatal depression,speak to your GP, health visitor and/or midwife. It’s never too late to seek help: you can feel better even if you’ve had symptoms for a long time. Different help is available depending on how severe your symptoms are. You could be offered a self-help course or talking therapy such asCognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). You canrefer yourself for talking therapyin England. CBT can help you see how the ways you think and behave may be making you feel depressed.

Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. PTSD used to be called ‘shell shock’ when it was seen in veterans, but we now know it doesn’t just affect soldiers. Anyone who experiences or witnesses an extremely stressful event can develop PTSD. PTSD isn’t a sign of weakness or a choice. It can be very distressing, but there is treatment available, no matter how long ago you experiencedtrauma. Feeling shocked and distressed after a traumatic event is normal, but most people feel better after a few weeks. However, sometimes trauma can cause difficulties in your daily life, including looking after yourself, trusting people and holding down a job.It can make you more vulnerable to developing mental and physical health problems.And for some people, experiencing trauma can lead to PTSD. PTSD causes three main groups of symptoms. You might also have difficulties with daily life, such as looking after yourself, maintaining friendships or holding down a job. When you’re diagnosed with PTSD, you might be told it is mild, moderate or severe. This describes how your symptoms are affecting you. You might also be told you have a specific type of PTSD. Being involved in anytraumatic event– something that causes fear, helplessness or horror – can lead to PTSD. Some examples include: Some factors make it more likely you will develop PTSD or experience more severe symptoms, including: While it isn’t clear why PTSD develops, there are a number of possible reasons. The NHS website has further explanations ofwhy PTSD can develop. PTSD can be treated years after the traumatic event occurred, so it’s never too late to get help. Speak to your GP if you’re experiencing symptoms of PTSD. They may suggest the following treatments. If you’ve had symptoms for less than four weeks or they’re relatively mild, your GP may recommend carefully monitoring them to see if they get better or worse. This is because two out of three people who develop problems after a traumatic experience get better by themselves within a few weeks. You should be offered a follow-up appointment within a month. NICE – the organisation that produces guidelines for healthcare professionals – recommends two kinds oftalking therapyfor PTSD. You may be offered these therapies for complex PTSD too, but with additional support to help you get the most out of your treatment. You may be offered more or longer sessions than usual to allow you to build trust with your therapist. You should be offered treatment for any other problems you have, too, such as dissociation ordrugoralcoholmisuse. You canself-referfor talking therapy on the NHS if you live in England.

If you’re diagnosed with psychosis, it means a mental health professional has determined you have lost some contact with reality. You might see or hear things that other people can’t or believe are not true. Many of us have had times when we’ve seen or heard things that other people can’t. For example, we may have heard the voice of a loved one who has died or glimpsed them in familiar places. This can be deeply comforting. Or we may have had the more upsetting experience of being convinced of flaws in our physical appearance that other people just can’t see. None of these things means you’ll be diagnosed with psychosis. But if symptoms such as paranoia or hearing voices start to interfere with your daily life – making it painful or distressing – then a mental health professional may diagnose you with psychosis. You may find your experience of psychosis very distressing and frightening, making you feel anxious, confused, overwhelmed and unable to know who to trust. Sometimes psychosis is caused by a specific mental health condition such asschizophrenia,bipolar disorderor severedepression. Psychosis may also be triggered by atraumaticexperience,stress,drugoralcoholmisuse, prescribed medicine's side effects, or even a physical condition such as a brain tumour. Childbirth can sometimes triggerpostnatal psychosis. Sometimes there isn’t an obvious cause or trigger. Psychosis is often treated with a combination of antipsychoticmedicine,talking therapiesand/or social support. Our page onschizophreniahas more information about what you may be offered. Your doctor should refer you to a secondary mental health team if this is the first time you’ve asked for help with psychosis.

They can manage your care to make sure you get the right treatment and social care support. Some people findpeer support– where you talk to other people with the same symptoms or diagnosis as you – can help them feel less alone and discover new ways of coping.

When it comes to mental illness, recovery can mean different things. For some people, it will mean no longer having symptoms of their mental health condition. For others, it will mean managing their symptoms, regaining control of their life and learning new ways to live the life they want. Recovery is often described as a process that isn’t always straightforward. You might have days (or weeks, or months) where you feel well and times when your symptoms return. If you’ve discovered techniques and treatments that work for you, you’re likely to feel more confident, and less overwhelmed by your symptoms. When it comes to your recovery, think about what’s important for you and what a meaningful life would look like. Different things may help, and no right or wrong way to recover. Some research suggests that key factors on the road to recovery include: Setting goals may help you recover. Think about what’s important to you: whether that’s making new friends, having a routine or finding voluntary work. Consider making SMART goals. SMART stands for: Don’t be hard on yourself if you don’t reach your goal. Maybe you need more time to achieve it, or maybe it isn’t right for you right now. Whatever it is that’s important to your recovery, remember you don’t have to figure things out on your own. Support from others – whether that’s your GP, friends, family or professionals involved in your care – can make a recovery easier. You may want to start bytalking to your GPabout your options: whether that’s medication, therapy or other kinds of help such as support groups or complementary therapies.

Doctors often describe schizophrenia as a type ofpsychosis. This means you might be unable to tell the difference between your thoughts and reality. It’s becoming more common for the term ‘psychosis’ to be used, so you may be given a diagnosis of psychosis rather than schizophrenia. NICE – the organisation that produces guidelines for healthcare professionals – now refers to them both as a single category. During an episode of schizophrenia, the way you see and understand the outside world is disrupted. You may: Schizophrenia is one of the most common serious mental health conditions. Around 1 in 100 people will have one episode of schizophrenia, and two-thirds of these will go on to have further episodes. Schizophrenia usually starts in your late teens or early 20s. Some people need a great deal of help in managing the symptoms of schizophrenia. Others find ways to cope with experiences such as hearing voices and don’t necessarily want to receive any treatment. The exact cause of schizophrenia is unknown, but most experts think it’s linked to genetic and environmental factors. Stressful experiences and some recreational drugs can also trigger an episode in vulnerable people. There are many common misconceptions about schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is often treated with a combination oftalking therapyandmedication: usuallycognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)and antipsychotic medication. You may also receive help from social services or a community mental health team. Different talking therapies can help with schizophrenia. CBT can help you manage symptoms such as hearing voices or delusions. It can also help normalise psychosis and make it less frightening – for example, by explaining that hearing voices is common or that there are times when we can all feel paranoid. Normalising these experiences can reduce yourstressand remove anystigmayou may feel. Art therapy can help you express how you feel and come to terms withtraumatic experiencesyou may have faced. Family intervention can help you and your family cope better with your condition. It can help you all learn more about your symptoms, improve your communication and help you support each other. Antipsychotic medication can help reduce the symptoms of schizophrenia. You should work with your doctor to find the right antipsychotic. They can cause side effects, and you should tell your doctor if they become severe. There may be a different antipsychotic you can try or other medications you can take to help with the side effects. You may take antipsychotics for a short time or need to take them long-term. Learning to spot the early signs of becoming unwell can prevent you from having a relapse. Signs can include losing your appetite,not sleeping wellorfeeling anxious. You may develop mild symptoms such as hearing quiet voices, feeling suspicious, or finding it hard to concentrate. Tell someone you trust or your doctor or support worker if you notice any early signs so that you can get help to avoid a relapse. When you’re unwell, it may be difficult or impossible to tell people how you’d like to be treated. It can help to plan by writing anadvance statementto help friends, family, and medical professionals make decisions on your behalf. You could also make a crisis card, a small document you can carry in your pocket or wallet explaining what to do and who to contact if you’re unable to communicate.

You may self-harm if you’re dealing with intense or overwhelming feelings as a way to try and cope. There are lots of different ways people can hurt themselves. Self-harm isn’t always obvious and can include things you might not think of as self-harm, such as over-exercising, misusingdrugsoralcohol, not eating, getting into fights or having unsafe sex. Anyone can self-harm, but it’s more common in: There are many reasons why you may self-harm. It may be how you try to deal with a stressful or upsetting situation that’s happening now or that you experienced in the past. Or you might not be sure why you hurt yourself. Whatever your reasons, there is help available. You may hurt yourself if you’re overwhelmed by difficult feelings such as sadness, guilt or hopelessness. Self-harm may be a way to express these feelings, especially if you find it hard to put them into words. Physical pain can also be a distraction from your emotional pain. You may self-harm to try to feel in control of your body, especially if you dissociate (feel detached from yourself and your environment). Some people hurt themselves because they feel they need to punish themselves for not being ‘good enough’. There can be a link betweensuicidal thoughtsand self-harm, but most people who hurt themselves don’t want to die. Some people describe self-harm as a way of staying alive and managing severe emotional distress. Self-harm can bring a sense of temporary relief. But the underlying issues won’t go away, and when your feelings build up, you may feel like you have to hurt yourself again. It can be hard to break out of this cycle, but finding other ways to cope is possible. It can be difficult to open up about self-harm. Understandably, you might worry about being judged or not understood. Remember that your doctor or any other health professional should treat you in a sensitive and non-judgemental way. They should talk to you about all your options so you can find the help that’s right for you. If you’ve hurt yourself badly or worried you might act on suicidal thoughts, go to A&E or call 999.

Many people with physical health problems already use self-management to help with their symptoms, but it has also been proven to improve the lives of people with mental health conditions. Self-management courses can help you better understand your mental health condition and consider what helps you stay well. They can also help you plan for times when you’re unwell or in acrisis. They’re often designed and/or delivered by people with lived experience of mental ill-health. Courses usually include: They can also help you feel more assertive when asking mental health services for the support you need. Courses are free and provided by the NHS as well as other groups and organisations. Some are in-person, while others are online - either through live video calls or online videos you can work through at your own pace. As well as courses, self-management can include webinars, health and wellbeing plans you can complete yourself, or wellness recovery action plans (WRAPS). Ourrecoverypage has more about WRAPS. Courses can cover challenging topics, so it might not be right for you if you’re unwell or have recently been hospitalised for your mental health condition. You also have to be able to manage being in a group, often for several hours at a time. If you’re unsure, contact the group organiser to discuss any concerns. Self-management courses are based on the principle that you know what works best for you – better than anyone else. During a course, you'll typically learn to: Ask your GPor other health worker involved in your care about self-management courses on the NHS, or search online to find out what’s available in your area.

But a lot of us struggle to get a good night’s sleep, and the consequences can be more serious than feeling grumpy or unfocused. Sleep and mental health are closely related: living with a mental health condition can affect your sleep, and poor sleep can affect your mental health. Lack of sleep can also make us feel physically unwell.It’s linked to heart disease, diabetes, premature ageing and road accident deaths. We all have nights when it’s hard to fall asleep or wake up several times. Most sleep problems sort themselves out within a month, but longer stretches of bad sleep can seriously affect our lives. Self-help techniques can get you back to a more normal sleeping pattern. But sleep problems can be symptoms of other conditions such as depression or thyroid problems, sospeak to your GPif they continue. Here are some sleep problems people experience: Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder, affecting around one in three people. You may have insomnia if you find it hard to go to sleep, wake up several times during the night or wake up too early. During the day, you may feel sleepy, anxious, irritable, and unable to concentrate or remember things. Narcolepsy can cause you to suddenly fall asleep at inappropriate times. It’s caused by the brain being unable to regulate your sleeping and waking patterns. If you have narcolepsy, you may feel very drowsy throughout the day and fall asleep suddenly and without warning – for example, while at work, talking, or driving. There is no cure, but the symptoms can be controlled by medication and by lifestyle adjustments such as changing your sleeping routine, improving yourdietandexercising. Sleep apnoea is when your breathing stops and starts when you sleep, constantly interrupting your rest. If you have sleep apnoea, you will often snore loudly or make gasping or choking noises while you sleep. During the day, you will feel very tired, find it hard to concentrate, have mood swings, and have a headache on waking. Losing weight and sleeping on your side can help with mild sleep apnoea. You can also be prescribed special devices to help keep your airway open during sleep. Many different things that can affect our sleep. They include: Mental health problems can affect your sleep in different ways. There are many things you can try to help yourself sleep well. If self-help doesn't work,talk to your doctor. Consider keeping a sleep diary for 10 days before your visit so you can explain the problem. Doctors will generally look for any underlying medical or psychological reason for the problem and may suggest further changes to your routine or lifestyle to help improve your sleep. If these don't work, your doctor may suggest sleeping pills for insomnia. Sleeping tablets can help in the short term but quickly become less effective and can even worsen your sleeping problems. They can also be very addictive. For all these reasons, sleeping pills are generally prescribed at the lowest dose and for a short period. If your problems persist, your doctor may refer you to a specialist sleep disorder clinic. Children need long periods of uninterrupted sleep for their growth and development, but sleep problems are common – especially among younger children. This can have a big impact on the whole family. Children may be reluctant to go to sleep, wake in the night, have nightmares or sleepwalk. Some children with disabilities like autism seem to have difficulty establishing a consistent sleep pattern. Some of the self-help measures above can be adapted for children. It’s also a good idea to keep a sleep diary to show their doctor. Excessive sleeping or a continued reluctance to get up could suggest depression or another mental health problem.

If you’re a smoker, there is now a lot of support available to help you quit. It’s never too late to give up, and you may find that quitting reduces your levels of stress, anxiety and depression. When a person smokes, nicotine reaches the brain within about ten seconds. At first, nicotine improves mood and concentration, decreases anger and stress, relaxes muscles and reduces appetite. Regular doses of nicotine lead to changes in the brain, which then lead to nicotine withdrawal symptoms when the supply of nicotine decreases. Smoking temporarily reduces these withdrawal symptoms and can therefore reinforce the habit. This cycle is how most smokers become nicotine dependent. Some people smoke as ‘self-medication’ to ease feelings ofstress. However, research has shown that smoking actually increases anxiety and tension. Nicotine creates an immediate sense of relaxation, so people smoke in the belief it reduces stress and anxiety. This feeling is temporary and soon gives way to withdrawal symptoms and increased cravings. Smoking reduces withdrawal symptoms but doesn’t reduce anxiety or deal with the reasons someone may feel that way. Adults with depression are twice as likely to smoke as adults without depression. Most people start to smoke before showing signs of depression, so it’s unclear whether smoking leads to depression or depression encourages people to start smoking. It’s most likely that there is a complex relationship between the two. Nicotine stimulates the release of the chemical dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is involved in triggering positive feelings. It is often found to be low in people with depression, who may then use cigarettes to temporarily increase their dopamine supply. However, smoking encourages the brain to switch off its mechanism for making dopamine, so in the long term, the supply decreases, which in turn prompts people to smoke more. People with depression can have particular difficulty when they try to stop smoking and have more severe withdrawal symptoms. Remember, there’s lots of support available if you decide to quit. However – you don’t have to go through it alone. People withschizophreniaare three times more likely to smoke than other people and tend to smoke more heavily. It’s likely this is because people with schizophrenia use smoking to control or manage some of the symptoms associated with their illness and reduce some of the side effects of their medication. A recent study has shown smoking may increase the risk of developing schizophrenia. However, further research is needed to fully understand how the two are linked. Stopping smoking suddenly through willpower alone is the least effective way to quit. If you plan, have support and choose the right time to try, you’re more likely to be successful. If you’re feeling unstable, experiencing a crisis or undergoing significant changes in your life, you’re less likely to quit. If you take antidepressants or antipsychotic medicines,talk to your GPor psychiatrist before you stop smoking. The dosage you take may need to be monitored, and the amount you need to take could be reduced. This is because smoking can reduce the levels of some medications in the blood, so you may need a lower dose when you quit. Think about your relationship with smoking. Write down what you will gain by not smoking, such as betterphysical health, fresher breath, improved concentration and more money to spend on other things. Stopping smoking can be easier with the support of family and friends. If you live with people who smoke, or have friends who smoke, suggest to them that you give up together. If other household members smoke, encourage them not to smoke around you or leave their cigarettes, ashtrays or lighters where you will see them. If you use smoking to cope with stress, you’ll need to find other ways to deal with it. Some things people find helpful are meditation and breathing exercises, regularexercise, cutting down onalcohol, eating a well-balanceddiet, acupuncture and hypnosis. Counselling or simply talking to a supportive friend, family member or religious or spiritual leader can also help. You’re three times as likely to stop smoking successfully if you use astop smoking service. They offer free one-to-one or group support along with stop-smoking medicines. You usually go for a few weeks before you quit, then once a week for four weeks after your last cigarette. Many people don’t realise their GP can help them stop smoking. They may enrol you in a stop smoking clinic, prescribe nicotine replacement therapy, or stop smoking medicine. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), anti-depressants and other medication have all been shown to help smokers without mental health problems stop smoking. They may also be helpful for people with depression or schizophrenia. NRT appears to be more effective when combined with talking therapy. You could also consider e-cigarettes. They’re much safer than cigarettes and can help people stop smoking. Talk to your doctor, a pharmacist or a health visitor about which treatments might be suitable for you. Individual, group or telephone counselling can help people to stop smoking.Talking therapiescan help people change their behaviour by thinking and acting more positively. Many counselling programmes use the techniques of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and social skills development. Research has shown that CBT may be particularly effective in smokers with or without mental health problems. Removing all tobacco products from your home can help lessen some of the cravings for nicotine withdrawal. Learn to recognise your smoking triggers. Identify when you crave cigarettes, such as at a party or after a meal. Try to avoid those situations where possible, or plan ways to resist triggers you can’t avoid. Most cravings only last a few minutes. If you can ride them out, you’ll be closer to quitting for good. You may experience headaches, nausea, irritability, anxiety, craving cigarettes, feeling miserable, difficulty concentrating, increased appetite and drowsiness. Drinking more fresh fruit juice or water, eating more high-fibre foods and reducing caffeine and refined sugar in your diet can all help you cope with withdrawal symptoms. Many people who quit smoking will relapse at some point. Don’t be put off trying again. Use it as an opportunity to reflect on what went wrong, learn about yourself and figure out what will help you be more successful in future.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/a-z-topics/stigma-and-discrimination,Stigma and discrimination,"This content discusses discrimination or discriminatory violence (such as homophobia, racism, sexism and ableism), which some people may find triggering. Mental health problems are common, affecting thousands of us in the UK. Despite this, there is still a strong stigma (negative attitude) around mental health. People with mental health problems can also experience discrimination (negative treatment) in all aspects of their lives. This stigma and discrimination make many people’s problems worse. It can come from society, employers, the media, and even our friends and family. You may even experience internalised stigma, where you come to believe the negative messages or stereotypes about yourself. Nearly nine out of ten people with mental health problems say that stigma and discrimination have a negative effect on their lives. We know that people with mental health problems are among the least likely of any group with a long-term health condition or disability to: Stigma and discrimination can also make someone’s mental health problems worse and delay or stop them from getting help. Social isolation, poor housing, unemployment and poverty are all linked to mental ill health. So stigma and discrimination can trap people in a cycle of illness. You may face more than one type of stigma: for example, you may also be stigmatised because of your race, gender, sexuality or disability. This can make life even harder. There are many reasons for this discrimination, including: Showing someone that there’s no shame or stigma in talking about how they feel could make a huge difference.It can be challenging to know what to do if you are worried about someone. If you suspect there is an issue, it is essential to tackle the stigma you feel. Waiting and hoping they will come to you for help might lose valuable time getting them support. Challenging stigma can be as simple as asking someone if they’re sure if they tell you they’re feeling fine. It means providing an open and non-judgemental space, keeping language neutral and asking open questions. For more tips, see our article onhow to support someone with a mental health problem.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/a-z-topics/stress,Stress,"This content mentions depression, anxiety and death or bereavement, which some people may find triggering. Stress is our body’s response to pressure. Many different situations or life events can cause stress. It is often triggered when we experience something new or unexpected that threatens our sense of self or when we feel we have little control over a situation. We all deal with stress differently. Our ability to cope can depend on our genetics, early life events, personality and social and economic circumstances. When we encounter stress, our body produces stress hormones that trigger a fight or flight response and activate our immune system. This helps us respond quickly to dangerous situations. Sometimes, this stress response can be helpful. It can help us push through fear or pain so we can run a marathon or deliver a speech, for example. Our stress hormones usually return to normal quickly once the stressful event is over, and there won’t be any lasting effects. However, too much stress can cause adverse effects. It can leave us in a permanent stage of fight or flight, leaving us overwhelmed or unable to cope. Long term, this can affect our physical and mental health. Many things can lead to stress:bereavement, divorce or separation, losing a job or unexpectedmoney problems.Work-related stresscan also have a negative impact on your mental health. People affected by work-related stress lose an average of 24 days of work due to ill health. Even positive life changes, such as moving to a bigger house, gaining a job promotion or going on holiday, can be sources of stress. If you feel stressed in these situations, you may struggle to understand why or be unwilling to share your feelings with others. These feelings can sometimes produce physical symptoms, making you feel even worse. If the stress is long-lasting, you may notice your sleep and memory are affected, your eating habits change, or you feel less inclined to exercise. Some research has also linked long-term stress to gastrointestinal conditions like Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) or stomach ulcers and conditions like cardiovascular disease. All of us can probably recognise some of the feelings described above. Some people seem to be more affected by stress than others. For some people, getting out of the door on time each morning can be a very stressful experience, whereas others may be less affected by a great deal of pressure. Some people are more likely to experience stressful situations than others. For example: If you're feeling stressed, there are some things you can try to feel less tense and overwhelmed. If you continue to feel overwhelmed by stress, don’t be afraid to seek professional help. It doesn’t mean you’re a failure. Getting help as soon as possible is important so you can start feeling better. Talk to your doctor about how you’re feeling. They should be able to advise you on treatment and may refer you for further help. They may suggest talking therapies such as: If your stress is work-related, our page onwork-life balancemay help.

Men are three times more likely than women to die by suicide. Women are more likely to report suicidal thoughts. Men aged 45 to 49 and women aged 50 to 54 have the highest suicide rates in England and Wales. Suicidal feelings can be confusing, frightening and complicated. They can range from having general thoughts about not wanting to be here to make a plan about how and when you could end your life.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/a-z-topics/talking-therapies,Talking therapies,"Talking therapy involves talking to a trained professional about your thoughts, feelings and behaviour. Describing what’s going on in your head and how that makes you feel can help you notice any patterns you may want to change. It can help you work out where your negative feelings and ideas come from and why they are there. Understanding all this can help you make positive changes, take greater control of your life and improve your confidence. This page uses the word ‘talking therapy’, but you may also hear it referred to as talking treatment, counselling, therapy, psychotherapy or psychological therapy. Talking therapy can help with: It doesn’t have to be a last resort or something you turn to in a crisis. If you think you could do with talking to someone in a safe space who won’t judge you, then it’s ok to try it. There are many different approaches when it comes to therapy. Therapists may train in one approach or use a number of different methods. Some use specialist techniques – for example, an art therapist would use art to help you explore your feelings. Others offer specialist treatment for specific issues such as addictions or eating disorders. It can be easy to be overwhelmed by the number of different types of talking therapy out there. Don’t let that put you off. We go through some different types below, but the most important thing is the relationship you have with your therapist. Trusting them and feeling comfortable opening up means you will get the most from your sessions, no matter what approach they use. There are many different types of talking therapy, although your choice may be limited depending on where and how you access it. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)recommends certain therapies for certain problems, but other therapies might work for you just as well. Here are some of the main kinds of talking therapy. This looks at how your thoughts and beliefs affect your feelings and behaviour. By changing how you react to your thoughts (for example, challenging negative thoughts) and how you behave (for example, trying new activities), you can start to feel better. CBT was amazing – it was so simple. My diagnosis is bipolar disorder and I had very low self-esteem and lack of confidence in my future. I had about 15 sessions over a year. The psychologist showed me how to notice what I was thinking and then how I felt afterwards, and to realise you can choose your own thoughts. I thought they were just random thoughts there to make my life a misery. But I learnt that at any time I could stop and say: ‘Why am I thinking that?’ I had a CBT therapist but I think she probably used lots of different things – in fact it didn’t feel like she was ‘using’ anything – it felt like a natural process rather than anything very medical or clinical. DBT is an adapted form of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) that can intensely help people who experience emotions. It teaches you how to live in the moment, cope with stress, regulate your emotions and improve your relationships. Psychodynamic therapy explores how your childhood experiences and unconscious mind influence your current thoughts, feelings, relationships and behaviour. Your therapist may use techniques such as: I was quite severely depressed as a teenager. I tried various antidepressants and some CBT-based stuff, but nothing was helping. Finally, my GP suggested that I try psychotherapy at my local mental health unit. At first I was sceptical. I couldn’t see how sitting in a room with a stranger was going to help. I was quite a nightmare, trying to prove to my therapist and myself that the therapy would fail. But with psychodynamic therapy, the therapist is prepared to sit and wait out that part with you. She started helping me link the way I was thinking, feeling and behaving to what might have gone on when I was younger and that really made sense. Humanistic therapy lets you explore your whole self rather than just specific problems. It aims to help you grow, live your life to the full and be true to yourself. Your therapist will offer you empathy, warmth and genuineness to help you make these changes. Person-centred therapy, Gestalt therapy and transactional analysis are all examples of humanistic therapy. The British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) hasmore information about them. I was referred to a unit that deals with people who turn to alcohol because of psychological problems. I was in a state of constant panic and had been drinking to keep those feelings at bay. There wasn't a set formula to the sessions. We'd just go and get a cup of coffee and I'd talk about what was bothering me. With person-centred counselling the therapist steers you through finding out more about yourself and developing confidence. You can find a therapist in different ways, although not all types of therapy will be available everywhere. Your GPor another health professional may refer you to a qualified therapist, or you canself-referif you live in England. The therapy will be provided free on the NHS. There are long waiting lists in many places, and you may not have much choice in who you see. TheNational Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)advises which treatments doctors should prescribe. NICE recommends certain therapies for certain problems, which may be easier to get on the NHS than others. You can choose to pay for your therapy if you can afford it. Therapists may charge anything from £35 an hour and more depending on where you live, although some offer reductions to people on a low income. To find a private therapist, it’s a good idea to search via a website that only lists therapists who are registered with a professional body, such as: Some workplaces have Employee Assistance Programmes (EAPs) which may offer a limited number of free therapy sessions. Many colleges and universities offer free therapy services. Some charities and community organisations offer free or low-cost talking therapies, sometimes by using trainees. Ask your GP if they know anywhere local, contact local counselling training centres, or try one of the following. Sessions usually last 50 minutes and take place at regular, planned times. They can be face-to-face, on the phone or online. How often you see your therapist and how many sessions you have will depend on the type of therapy you’re having and your circumstances. You might see a therapist on your own, in a group, as a couple or as a family. In group therapy you don’t just talk about yourself, you’re listening to other people – that takes the burden off your problems. You realise you’re not the only one. During a session, you might talk generally about how you’re feeling, or you might go through specific exercises, depending on your therapist’s approach. What you talk about could include your childhood, your relationships, past and present life events, or stressful situations. Your therapist will listen to you without judging you and help you explore your thoughts and feelings. They won’t tell you what to do but will help you understand yourself better and think about the changes you may want to make. Talking therapies are not therapies that are‘done’ to you by someone else. You play an active part. That can be empowering at a time when you may feel you have lost control over part of your life. If you’re determined to get the most from your therapy, it’s more likely to work. You need to be honest with yourself in therapy, which can be difficult. It may mean facing up to your fears, recalling distressing memories or talking about intimate topics and private thoughts and feelings. Think about whether you’re ready to open up and talk to your therapist if you feel overwhelmed. Sessions should always go at your pace, so you don’t feel rushed. You may already have questions to ask yourself or your therapist. Here are some to consider. When you meet a therapist for the first time (sometimes called an assessment), they will be working out if they can help you. That’s your chance to find out about the therapist too.The British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP)has an information sheet onwhat happens in your first session. Finding a therapist you connect with might take a few tries. Take your time to find someone who feels right so that you can get the most from your sessions. Your relationship with your therapist is really important. A good therapist will listen to you, have your best interests at heart and help you learn how to change. They will check you’re getting what you want from therapy and refer you to someone else if they can’t help with your particular issue. What I found really good was being able to talk about what was happening and have someone who was listening – she was really good at giving me space, listening to what had happened and discussing what might have caused it – not in a deep way but trying to help me piece the whole picture together. A good therapist concentrates on what is important in your life, what you want to achieve, and what steps you could take to get there. They shouldn't tell you what to do. Your therapist may be highly trained and very experienced, but you are the expert. Remember, therapy is a two-way process. If you have any questions, ask them. A good therapist will help you deal with your worries and work out how you will manage when therapy comes to an end. It can take time to build a relationship with your therapist and start to open up. Depending on what you've talked about, you may feel sad or frustrated after sessions. But if you’re not happy with how the sessions are going, you can: If you have a serious concern about your therapist, you can make a complaint. You can contact the professional body your therapist is registered with and follow their complaints procedure. You can ask your therapist who they’re registered with or see if it’s mentioned in your contract if you have one. For example, you can complain about aBACP memberor aUKCP memberby following the steps on their websites. The BACP has a‘get help with counselling concerns’ serviceyou can contact by phone or email.

Of course, you can make an earlier appointment if things aren’t getting better or you have any worries. Everything you tell your GP is confidential unless they think you’re at risk of seriously harming yourself or someone else. In this case, they should still generally keep you informed about what will happen next. They might ask to see you again soon, ask you to tell other people yourself, or tell another health or social care professional so they can assess you to see if you need to go to a hospital. In very rare cases, they may tell the police. A third of GP appointments involve talking about mental well-being, so your doctor will be very used to hearing about mental health concerns. They won’t judge you for having mental ill-health any more than they’d judge you for having a rash or stomach pain. If you’re depressed or anxious, these thoughts could be part of your condition. It’s common to have low self-worth and fear no one cares or understands you. Try not to let these thoughts stop you from making an appointment. And remember – if you’re unhappy with how your GP treats you, you can switch to another one or move to a new GP practice. You must be registered with a local practice to make an appointment. It’s easy and quick to register and see any of their GPs. You can call, email or visit a local practice to see if you can join. To find local GP practices: You can change GPs whenever you want. For example, you may want to move if you’ve had a bad experience at your current practice or if you want to join one that offers specialised counselling or mental health services. In England, theNHS websitelets you look at ratings and reviews from people who have used the practice. If you’re unhappy with how your appointment went or unsure about your advice, you can ask for a second opinion from another GP or a specialist. You can make an appointment with another GP at your practice or change the practice altogether if they refuse to arrange a second opinion. If you disagree with how your GP wants to treat your mental health problem, or you’re unhappy about the service provided by your GP practice, you may wish to make a complaint. You can speak to your GP or the practice manager or make a written complaint. Ask at reception for the practice’s complaints procedure or find it on their website.

As more people talk about their mental health, the language we use about mental health is changing. This can have a positive impact on the stigma of mental ill-health.

You should ask people whether they want to talk about their mental health and, if so, how they would like to discuss their experiences. They are the experts in their lives. It’s also important not to let fear about saying the wrong thing stop you from having conversations about mental health or asking someone how they are. Avoiding the subject can make people feel silenced or stigmatised, even if that’s not what you intended. Be careful when speaking about other people’s experiences – whether it’s someone you know, in the public eye, or on the news. It’s easy to gossip, but it’s usually unhelpful and can be harmful. Being open about mental health is good and allows conversations to develop naturally. When choosing your words, some helpful terms and some can reinforce stigma or cause upset. Safe, open conversations will feel more considerate and respectful to most people with lived experience of mental health problems. They can also help others feel more able to talk about their own experiences. If a friend, relative or colleague doesn’t seem themselves, it’s good to check in and see how they are. You might have noticed they seem distracted, less able to concentrate, more angry or irritable than usual or that they’re hiding away. Talking is good for your mental health. But starting a conversation isn’t always easy. If you’d like to talk to someone about how you’re feeling, here are some tips that can help. This might be a friend, family member or a colleague. Or you might be more comfortable talking to someone you don’t know, for example, through a support helpline. It can help to do a pros and cons list about talking to someone. It’s important to choose a place where you feel comfortable enough to open-up. You might want to choose somewhere private where you’re less likely to be disturbed. You also might want to talk while you do an activity, like walking together. Hopefully, you will have a good experience when you open-up to someone. But there’s a chance that they may not react in the way you hope. This may be for different reasons, like they may be worried or not fully understand at first.  If that’s the case, try to give them time to process what you’ve told them. It might help to give them information to read to help them understand. And don’t forget to be kind to yourself and practice self-care.

Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. Trauma can happen to anyone at any age. It affects everyone differently. You might have been caught up in the same frightening event as someone else and have a completely different reaction. Traumatic events are those that put you or someone close to you at risk of serious harm or death. Our usual ways of coping are overwhelmed, leaving us feeling frightened and unsafe. We can be traumatised through: How you’re affected by trauma is not related to how strong you are. Your reaction can depend on whether you’ve had previous traumatic experiences, other stresses in your life and how much support you have afterwards. When faced with a traumatic event, our bodies react by preparing us to respond. This is an automatic survival mechanism and we have no control over it. You might have heard of ‘fight or flight’, but there is a wider range of reactions. Physically, you might notice your heart beating faster, thoughts racing, breathing becoming quicker and shallower, sight becoming sharper, nausea, cold hands, shaking or dizziness. These all prepare your body to react to danger but can be uncomfortable or frightening if you don’t know why they’re happening. Your body will usually return to normal within half an hour of the event. However, sometimes these feelings continue long after the trauma is over. Our bodies and minds get stuck in this danger mode even when the threat has passed. You may find yourself reliving the event through flashbacks or nightmares, feel constantly on edge, angry, guilty or upset, havepanic attacks, feel numb or distant from others or have problemssleeping. Trauma can make you more vulnerable to developing mental health problems. It can also directly causepost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Some people misusealcohol,drugs, orself-harmto cope with difficult memories and emotions. Depending on how you’re affected, trauma may cause difficulties in your daily life. For example, it may be harder to trust people, which can make relationships and friendships harder to maintain. You may struggle to look after yourself, hold down a job or take pleasure in things you used to enjoy. You may have difficulty managing your emotions and react in ways that feel illogical or over-the-top – because your mind is reacting to the memory of what happened to you, not your current situation. Trauma can affect your body as well as your mind. Research shows it can increase your risk of developing physical health problems, including long-term illnesses.Speak to your GPabout any physical symptoms. It’s never too late to get help with the effects of trauma, no matter how long ago it occurred. There are different types of treatment available for trauma. The right one for you will depend on your symptoms and how they affect you.Speak to your GPto find out what help is available. Some services are starting to follow a trauma-informed approach, which means they should create a space where you feel safe and empowered and won’t be re-traumatised.

This could be significant, so it’s worth checking to find out what you could claim. You have nothing to lose and potentially a lot to gain. There are many different benefits that you could be eligible for. This page looks at some of the main benefits you could claim. Visit theMental Health and Money Advicewebsite to read about others. If you need extra help because of a long-term illness or disability (including a mental health condition), you could claim a disability benefit. Disability benefits are based on the level and frequency of help you need, not on your diagnosis or medication. It also doesn’t matter what your income is, whether you have any savings, and whether or not you’re working. If you’re on a low income, you might qualify for extra money each week to top it up. You could also get help with your rent or mortgage costs and with your Council Tax bill. Understanding the benefits system and applying for benefits can be difficult, especially if you’re unwell. There are places you can go for advice and support – see our ‘Useful resources and information’ section below. You might not think of yourself as disabled. But disability benefits aren’t just for people with a physical disability or long-term condition – they’re for people with mental health conditions too. It doesn’t matter whether or not you have a diagnosis. What matters is how your mental health problem affects you. If it prevents you from taking care of yourself without help or from getting around safely, you may qualify for a disability benefit. For example, Laura has been diagnosed with depression and often can’t get up in the mornings and get dressed unless her partner prompts her. She’s stopped going out because she can’t face seeing people. She sometimes doesn’t have the concentration span or motivation to cook a meal, so she skips dinner. Laura might not consider herself disabled because she is physically healthy. However, her mental ill-health is stopping her from taking care of herself so that she could be eligible for a disability benefit. If you find it hard to do everyday tasks because of a physical or mental health condition, you may qualify for a disability benefit. You could get: Everyday tasks include things such as washing and dressing, preparing food, taking medication, communicating verbally, socialising with other people and making decisions about your money. You can also get help with mobility needs if you’re claiming PIP. These include moving around and planning and following journeys. You could have difficulty with them because ofanxiety, agoraphobia orobsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), for example. Remember it isn’t your diagnosis that matters. It’s how it affects you. Mental Health and Money Advice havemore information about PIP, including useful phone numbers and template letters to download. Independent Age hasmore about AA. If you’re on a low income or too unwell to work, you could be entitled to help with your living costs, rent, mortgage, Council Tax bill and prescription costs. For emergency expenses, there are grants available from the Social Fund. What you could claim depends on many different factors, including your age, housing status, who you live with, whether or not you’re working and if you’re a carer. You might be eligible for: Use the freeEntitledTo online benefits calculatorto estimate what you could claim. It can be hard to work out what you can claim, so don’t feel you have to do it alone. A benefits adviser could help you – see our ‘Useful resources and information’ section below. Don't be put off if you’ve been turned down for a benefit or awarded a lower rate than you think you should. You can ask for the decision to be looked at again. This is called a mandatory reconsideration (or redetermination in Scotland). If you disagree with the outcome of the reconsideration, you can make an appeal. More than half of Personal Independence Payment (PIP) decisions are changed after mandatory reconsideration or appeal, so do challenge a decision you think is wrong. It doesn’t cost anything to appeal, although it can be a stressful process. You can get help with it from a benefits adviser. Citizens Advice has information onchallenging a PIP decision.

Social and economic factorscan put women at greater risk of poor mental health than men. However, women generally find it easier to talk about their feelings and have stronger social networks, both of which can help protect their mental health. This page is aimed at all women, but trans women may also find useful information fromMermaidsandGendered Intelligence. Around one in five women have a common mental health problem, such asdepressionandanxiety. While there can be many reasons why these develop, some risk factors affect many women. Women are more likely than men: When women find it hard to talk about difficult feelings, they tend to internalise them. This can lead todepression,eating disordersandself-harm. Men are more likely to act out their feelings through disruptive or anti-social behaviour. On the other hand, some factors protect women’s mental health: they tend to have better social networks than men, find it easier to confide in their friends and are more likely to have been treated for a mental health problem. Life eventsand hormonal changes can affect women’s mental health. Having a baby is a life-changing event. For some women, it can triggerpostnatal depression(after birth) and/or antenatal depression (during pregnancy). The term ‘perinatal depression’ covers both. Perinatal depression isn’t a sign of weakness; it doesn’t mean you’re a bad parent.

Speak toyour GPabout what’s best for you. We must acknowledge the impact of thecoronavirus pandemicon women's mental health. Women make up the majority of frontline health and care workers, are more likely to do unpaid work, are overrepresented in low-paid and insecure work and are more likely to have pre-existing difficulties withdebtand bills. They are also more likely to shoulder a higher proportion of caring responsibilities. All of the women in these positions were at greater risk of developing a mental health problem before the pandemic and will be at increased risk as the economic ramifications of the pandemic are realised. It is also the case that women are much more likely to be affected by domestic violence and abuse, the risk of incidence of which increased during the lockdown.

Our 2021 report'How connecting with nature benefits our mental health'found that 70% of UK adults agreed being close to nature improves their mood, and 49% said being close to nature helps them to cope withstress. Nature can mean green spaces, like parks or forests, and blue spaces, like rivers or beaches. Nature can also include the trees lining an urban street and indoor or houseplants. It has even been found that watching nature documentaries can improve your mental health. Evidence shows us that the quality of our relationship and connection with nature is vital to the mental health benefits of being in nature. A strong connection with nature would be a feeling of emotional attachment to our natural surroundings. Improving people’s relationship with nature comes through simple yet meaningful engagement with nature. Nature is all around us. Try to notice nature wherever you are, in whatever way is meaningful for you. Readour top tips on connecting with nature to improve your mental health. Any activity that involves the senses will help develop your connection with nature, or any activities that create feelings of compassion or perceiving beauty when you are in nature. This could be listening closely to birdsong or engaging your sense of touch by touching the bark of the trees on the street whilst on a walk or commuting to work. We can also connect with nature indoors. You could be intent and present when watering or feeding your houseplants, noticing the feeling of the leaves or the smell of the soil. Alternatively, you don’t even need to be around plants or nature to develop your connection with the natural world. You could write a poem or short story about a time you were in nature or go through any photographs you have of a picturesque landscape or nature scene. Research has shown that people with a strong connection with nature are typically happier in life, as nature can generate many happy emotions, including calmness, joy and creativity.

Body imageis a term used to describe how we think and feel about our bodies, including how satisfied we are with our bodies and how much we value what other people think about our bodies. Body image is a complex thing, closely related to mental health and affected by so many things around us – people, places, images, culture, the list goes on. Body image issues can affect all of us at any age and directly affect our mental health. Research shows that aiming for an unrealistic body image can create unhelpful attitudes about ourselves. We convince ourselves that we should strive for perfection based on what we perceive around us, but we do know, realistically, no one is perfect. This leaves us feeling like we’re never enough. We’re always reaching for perfection, but we will never get there. This leads to an unhealthy body image, but working towards acceptance can lead to a healthier body image. While having body image concerns is not a diagnosed mental health problem, it can be a risk factor for mental health problems. Our research'Body image: How we think and feel about our bodies'found that 21% of adults felt ‘satisfied’ because of their body image in the past year. We also found that around one-third of people (34%) have felt ‘down or low’, and 20% have felt ‘shame’ in the past year because of their body image. Body image is closely linked to mental health problems, such as body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) andeating disorders, likeanorexiaandbulimia. Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a mental health problem where a person spends a lot of time worrying about flaws in their appearance that are often unnoticeable to others, to the point that it affects their daily life. Even though body or appearance dissatisfaction is often more common among young women, body image concerns are relevant from childhood to later life and affect both women and men.

Acts of kindness don’t have to be big gestures: listening to someone intently after they have had a bad day, being accepting and non-judgemental to those around us or helping someone carry things when their arms are full are all examples of acts of kindness that we can do in our everyday lives. Doing something nice for someone doesn’t cost a lot of time or money; even the smallest acts can make you and someone else get that warm feeling. Remember:doing good does you good. Some ideas forrandom acts of kindnessthat you can incorporate into your day: Remember that whatever you manage today is good enough.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/jolies-story-my-experience-ms-and-being-survivor-psychiatric-system,MS and being a survivor of the psychiatric system,"I’m an artist living in South London with my husband and two children. I wanted to write about the experience of being a survivor of the psychiatric system and the long-term physical health condition of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). I was diagnosed with a recurring and remitting type of Multiple Sclerosis 8 years ago. After using mental health services, it was strange to have a neurologist pointing to abnormalities in a scan of my brain. The diagnosis was a huge shock, but I was helped by a family friend who also has MS, who told me that MS was nothing to be afraid of. In 2017, my MS symptoms became more severe. When I tried to run, my left leg felt like it was made of concrete. I first heard of the OMS programme through Liz Bentley’s book of poems, Mind Full of Mad Verse. My husband did some research, and with some trepidation, I started the diet in May 2017. I was fortunate to have already been practising Zen meditation, which is also a part of the OMS programme. In addition, I work in mental health and trying to manage my own mental health best underpins my work in the sector. My health has improved. My left side is still weaker than my right, but my leg no longer feels like concrete. And I no longer find myself so overwhelmed by exhaustion that I need to lie on the floor to rest in the middle of hanging up the washing. I also now know that pizzas taste fantastic without the cheese. Keeping to the diet is not currently an issue for me. There are losses, though. Spontaneity particularly. Eating out is a pleasure that’s less straightforward now. Sometimes I do catch myself wishing I could just eat without thinking about it. On the positive side, my family eats very differently now. I’m certainly healthier for the diet. My exercise of choice is swimming. I swim for health, exercise and because I enjoy it. I always feel better after a swim. I’m not fast, but last Autumn, I swam 2,000 metres in one stretch. I find the experience of my morning swims inspiring. I’ve been an artist for over 30 years. At a stage in my life when my artistic practice is pushed for time, making digital drawings after swimming has been a way to sustain my artwork. Each swim is different. The digital prints are my memories of the people and goings on in the slow lane. Being in the OMS programme has provided me with a way to be more in control of my life, change lanes when life is challenging, improve my quality of life and feel hopeful for the future. I held a private view and fundraiser for my showSwimming in the Slow Laneon Thursday, 5 December 2019. I donated 10% of the profits from the exhibition to two charities,Overcoming MSand the Mental Health Foundation - where I work four days a week as Programmes Manager for Empowerment & Later Life.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/articles/body-image-report-executive-summary/body-image-childhood,Body image in childhood,"While exact estimates vary, depending on how body image is measured, concerns and worries about appearance are commonplace among young people. One survey of 11–16-year-olds in the UK by Be Real found that 79% said how they look is important to them, and over half (52%) often worry about how they look(23). In our survey of young people aged 13–19, 35% said their body image causes them to ‘often’ or ‘always’ worry. While body image concerns affect both boys and girls, research suggests that girls are more likely to be dissatisfied with their appearance and their weight than boys(24,25). In our survey, 46% of girls reported that their body image causes them to worry ‘often’ or ‘always’ compared to 25% of boys. Body image concerns can also affect very young children. One review found studies identifying body dissatisfaction in children under the age of six, though estimates of the degree of dissatisfaction varied widely depending on how it was measured(26). Young people also tell us that body image is a substantial concern, with 16–25-year-olds identifying it as the third biggest challenge currently causing harm to young people, with lack of employment opportunities and failure to succeed within the education system is the first two(27). In young people, body dissatisfaction has been linked to risk-taking behaviours and mental health problems. One survey of UK adolescents by Be Real found that 36% agreed they would do ‘whatever it took’ to look good, with 57% saying they had considered going on a diet and 10% saying they had considered cosmetic surgery(23). Among secondary school boys, 10% said they would consider taking steroids to achieve their goals(7). Poor body image may also prevent young people from engaging in healthy behaviours, with some studies finding that children with poorer body image are less likely to take part in physical activity(5,28)and survey data from Be Real finding that 36% of girls and 24% of boys report avoiding taking part in activities like physical education due to worries about their appearance(23). Among adolescents, research has found that those with greater body appreciation are less likely to diet or use alcohol or cigarettes(5). Body dissatisfaction and pressure to be thin have been linked to depressive symptoms(15, 29)and symptoms of anxiety disorders such as social anxiety or panic disorder(16), particularly in those children who do not match societal views of the ‘ideal body’. Some studies have found that weight and body mass index (BMI) are correlated with body dissatisfaction, with youth people who are overweight or obese reporting greater depressive symptoms and lower self-esteem than their peers(30,31). Research conducted with young women also found a higher likelihood of suicidal thoughts among those women who reported extreme weight control behaviours (e.g. taking diet pills, diuretics or laxatives)(32), with an additional study suggesting that body image concerns may be a risk factor for self-harm behaviour among young people who are experiencing emotional difficulties(33). One common contributor to poor body image is pressure to live up to an ‘ideal’ body type or appearance and shame or other uncomfortable emotions when we perceive ourselves as not meeting this standard. The internalisation of this ideal has been linked to body dissatisfaction, disordered eating, and depressive symptoms in children and young people(19, 34, 35). These distressing emotions were reflected in our survey, where 37% of young people said they felt upset, and 31% said they felt ashamed about their body image. This ideal tends to be different between genders. Young women often feel pressure to be thin but still maintain curves, whereas young men often report pressure to be tall and muscular(19,23). Children who rejected appearance-related ideals reported being more confident about their appearance and were least likely to report body image concerns(23). How young people develop their sense of ‘ideal’ appearance is varied. Still, young people identify the media, pressure from family and friends, comparisons with peers, and personal factors like low self-esteem, feelings of depression, and a need for control as important influences on their body image(36,37). One commonly researched influence on body image is exposure to unrealistic ‘ideal’ bodies through film, television, magazines, advertising and social media. Exposure to these images is thought to facilitate valuing these ‘ideal’ and unrealistic body types. One study, which followed 14- and 15-year-olds over three years, found that internalisation of these ‘ideal’ body shapes as presented in the media predicted negative emotions about appearance, which in turn predicted unhealthy eating behaviours(34). In our survey, 25% of young people (13% of boys and 37% of girls) said celebrities have caused them to worry about their body image, and 19% (10% of boys and 28% of girls) said TV shows caused them to worry about their body image. Using more social media has also been linked to children and young people feeling less satisfied with their bodies (38,39). In our survey, 40% of young people (26% of boys and 54% of girls) said that images on social media have caused them to worry about their body image. One possible explanation for this is that social media allows for negative comparisons with others based on appearance. This is something that has consistently been linked to body dissatisfaction(40). Some studies suggest time spent on social media is linked to the frequency of appearance-related comparisons(41)and peer competition(42), which in turn may be linked to body dissatisfaction and mental health(41,42). The influence of the media on body image may be lessened by parental behaviour. One study found that the relationship between social media use and body dissatisfaction was weaker for adolescents with more positive maternal relationships(38).Another found that the children of parents who reported greater control over time spent on social media reported spending less time online, making fewer appearance-related comparisons, and having a better overall mental health(41). Parents and family can also have a negative effect on children’s body image and increase the likelihood of difficulties in this area. One study of adolescent girls found that over half had experienced weight-based teasing from family members, particularly girls who weighed more. These experiences were related to higher levels of body dissatisfaction and unhealthy eating behaviour(43). This was also reflected in our survey, where 29% of young people (21% of boys and 37% of girls) agreed that things their family said caused them to worry about their body image. This extends to how parents think, act and speak about their own bodies and their children’s bodies. Reviews of the research suggest that parents can affect their children’s body image in both direct ways (comments or criticisms about weight and appearance) and more indirect ways (parental eating behaviours and attitudes toward their own bodies and appearance)(19,44). As children grow older, their peers begin to play more of a role in reinforcing what an ideal body looks like. This can be through pressure from friends to feel accepted. In our survey, 40% of young people (37% of boys and 42% of girls) agreed that things their friends said caused them to worry about their body image. Another survey found that 68% of boys cited friends as a source of pressure to look good(7). How adolescents’ bodies change during puberty (a time of change in body height, weight and shape), how this compares with their peers, and how it compares to their own ideas of what an ‘ideal’ body looks like (which, in turn, can be influenced by the factors outlined above) will therefore affect body image(45). This may be especially true for girls who mature earlier than their peers and boys who mature later than their peers(45). The influence of peers can also be felt through bullying. A survey by Be Real of UK 11–16-year-olds found that over half of young people had experienced appearance-based bullying, with 40% of those young people experiencing bullying at least once a week and 54% saying the bullying had started by age 10(46). Children who do not match body ideals may be more likely to be the target of bullying. One review of the research found that young people who are overweight or obese are more likely to be subject to bullying than their peers(47). Appearance-based bullying can be detrimental to children’s mental health and body image. Adolescents who were cyberbullied were twice as likely to consider themselves ‘too fat’(25),and of those who were bullied about their appearance, 53% felt anxious, and 29% felt depressed(46). In contrast, having supportive friendships may be a protective influence. Some studies have found support for strong friendships being associated with decreased body dissatisfaction(25,48,49). However, children who are already feeling down about their bodies may perceive their peers as having a greater influence(50), particularly as self-esteem and body image are closely linked(24,51). 5.

Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. ‘Body image’ is a term that can be used to describe how we think and feel about our bodies. Our thoughts and feelings about our bodies can impact us throughout our lives, affecting, more generally, the way we feel about ourselves and our mental health and wellbeing. Having body image concerns is a relatively common experience and is not a mental health problem in and of itself; however, it can be a risk factor for mental health problems. Research has found that higher body dissatisfaction is associated with a poorer quality of life, psychological distress and the risk of unhealthy eating behaviours and eating disorders. Higher body dissatisfaction is associated with a poorer quality of life, psychological distress and the risk of unhealthy eating behaviours and eating disorders. Conversely, body satisfaction and appreciation have been linked to better overall well-being and fewer unhealthy dieting behaviours. Though feeling unsatisfied with our bodies and appearance is often more common among young women, body image concerns are relevant from childhood through to later life and affect both women and men. Body satisfaction and appreciation has been linked to better overall wellbeing and fewer unhealthy dieting behaviours.

We conducted new online surveys with YouGov in March 2019 of 4,505 UK adults 18+ and 1,118 GB teenagers (aged 13-19). The results highlighted that: One in five adults (20%) felt shame, just over one-third (34%) felt down or low, and 19% felt disgusted by their body image in the last year. Among teenagers, 37% felt upset, and 31% felt ashamed about their body image. Just over one-third of adults said they had ever felt anxious (34%) or depressed (35%) because of their body image. One in eight (13%) adults experienced suicidal thoughts or feelings because of concerns about their body image. Just over one in five adults (21%) said images used in advertising had caused them to worry about their body image Just over one in five adults (22%) and 40% of teenagers said images on social media caused them to worry about their body image Clearly, action is needed to build and promote positive body image and support good mental health and well-being in our bodies.

Helping others, especially those less fortunate than yourself, can help put things into perspective and make you feel more positive. There is some evidence that being aware of your own acts of kindness and the things you are grateful for can increase feelings of happiness, optimism, and satisfaction.5,6Doing good may help you have a more positive outlook on your circumstances. Acts of kindness have the potential to make the world a happier place. An act of kindness can improve feelings of confidence, being in control, happiness and optimism.6 It may also encourage others to repeat the good deed that they’ve experienced themselves – contributing to a more positive community.7 The benefits of helping others can last long after the act itself, both for you and them.

You may find it helpful to know there is someone you can talk to about the feelings you are having, and your doctor will be able to offer advice and (where appropriate) medication to help you better understand and manage your feelings. Your GP may also refer you to more specialist services for additional support if they feel this will help. However, talking to a doctor about your own mental health can be difficult - some people worry that they might be making a fuss, others are concerned they will not be listened to or taken seriously. This practical guides covers whether you need to see a GP and what your GP can help you with; how to prepare for an appointment; what to expect during your appointment; and next steps after your appointment. By using the tips and advice in the booklet you’ll be able tospeak to your GP about your mental healthwith greater confidence. Stress is our body’s response to pressure. Many different situations or life events can cause stress. It is often triggered when we experience something new, unexpected or that threatens our sense of self, or when we feel we have little control over a situation. It’s normal to feel anxious sometimes. It’s how we respond to feeling threatened, under pressure or stressed: for example if we have an exam, job interview or doctor’s appointment. Mild depression can make you feel low and as though everything is harder to do. Severe depression can lead to feeling hopeless and, in some cases, suicidal. Anyone can have OCD. It typically starts during early adulthood but can begin at any age. It can be distressing, time-consuming and interfere with your daily life. Home of Mental Health Awareness Week"

People who are more socially connected to family, friends, or their community are happier, physically healthier, and live longer, with fewer mental health problems than people who are less well connected. It’s not just the number of friends you have, and it’s not whether or not you’re in a committed relationship, but the quality of your close relationships that matters. Living in conflict or within a toxic relationship is more damaging than being alone. As a society and as individuals, we must urgently prioritise investing in building and maintaining good relationships and tackling the barriers to forming them. Failing to do so is equivalent to turning a blind eye to the impact of smoking and obesity on our health and well-being. This report explores relationships across the life course, why they matter and the importance of being part of a community.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/sleep-matters-impact-sleep-health-and-wellbeing,Sleep Matters: The Impact Of Sleep On Health And Wellbeing,"The aim of this report is to raise awareness about the importance of sleep and its crucial role for our health, both physical and mental, just like diet and exercise. In Part I of this report, we provide information about sleep, why we need to sleep, and what happens during sleep. In Part II, we review the literature on sleep problems and explain what can happen if we don’t sleep properly. In Part III, we describe ways in which we can improve our sleep and explain possible treatments for those who find achieving good quality sleep difficult. The primary focus of this report is sleep and mental health; both how mental health can affect our sleep, and how sleep can affect our mental health. This research report on sleep and mental health was published forMental Health Awareness Weekin 2011. We spend approximately a third of our lives asleep.Sleepis an essential and involuntary process, without which we cannot function effectively. It is as essential to our bodies as eating, drinking and breathing, and is vital for maintaining good mental and physical health. Sleeping helps to repair and restore our brains, not just our bodies. During sleep we can process information, consolidate memories, and undergo a number of maintenance processes that help us to function during the daytime. Sleep is crucial to the health of individuals within the UK and to the public health of the UK population. We all need to make sure we get the right amount of sleep, and enough good quality sleep. There is no set amount of sleep that is appropriate for everyone; some people need more sleep than others. Our ability to sleep is controlled by how sleepy we feel and our sleep pattern. How sleepy we feel relates to our drive to sleep. The sleep pattern relates to the regularity and timing of our sleep habits; if we have got into a pattern of sleeping at set times then we will be able to establish a better routine, and will find it easier to sleep at that time every day. Sleep is a more complex process than many people realise, much of it is still a mystery to scientists. During sleep, the body goes through a variety of processes and sleep stages. Good quality sleep is likely to be the result of spending enough time in all of the stages, including enough deep sleep which helps us feel refreshed. Poor sleep over a sustained period leads to a number of problems which are immediately recognisable, including fatigue, sleepiness, poor concentration, lapses in memory, and irritability. Up to one third of the population may suffer from insomnia (lack of sleep or poor quality sleep). This can affect mood, energy and concentration levels, our relationships, and our ability to stay awake and function during the day. Sleep and health are strongly related, poor sleep can increase the risk of having poor health, and poor health can make it harder to sleep. Common mental health problems likeanxietyanddepressioncan often underpin sleep problems. Where this is the case, a combination approach to treating the mental health problem and sleep problem in tandem is often the most effective. It is essential for us to better understand the sleep process in order to ensure that we get a regular amount of good quality sleep. Sleepio, co-founded by Professor Colin Espie, Director of the University of Glasgow Sleep Centre, is a new organisation that is dedicated to raising awareness of the importance of sleep. Sleepio collected data from a large-scale, national survey on sleep habits; some of these revealing new data appear throughout this report. We can all benefit from improving the quality of our sleep. For many of us, it may simply be a case of making small lifestyle or attitude adjustments in order to help us sleep better. For those with insomnia it is usually necessary to seek more specialist treatment. Sleep medication is commonly used, but may have negative side effects and is not recommended in the long-term. Psychological approaches are useful for people with long-term insomnia because they can encourage us to establish good sleep patterns, and to develop a healthy, positive mental outlook about sleep, as well as dealing with worrying thoughts towards sleeping. One of the most widely used and successful therapies isCognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). This is useful even for people who have had insomnia for a long period of time. A full course of such a therapy with a sleep specialist is potentially costly, and is most appropriate for people with severe sleep problems. Still, some CBT principles can be appropriate and easily practiced for anyone who is experiencing a sleepless night. We recommend that: 26th Jun 2025

Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. We all go through tough times, and people help us through them. Other times we have been worried about other people’s mental health. Whether they are a friend, family member or colleague, there are many ways to support somebody you care about. Sometimes it will seem obvious when someone is going through a hard time, but there is no simple way of knowing if they have a mental health problem. Sometimes you don’t need to know. It’s more important to respond sensitively to someone who seems troubled than to find out whether or not they have a diagnosis. Although certain symptoms are common with specific mental health problems, no two people behave the same way when unwell. You may notice changes in their behaviour or mood if you know the person well. OurA-Z of mental healthprovides information on various mental health problems. There are many ways you can help a friend, relative or colleague who has a mental health problem: It can be challenging to know what to do if you are worried about someone. When you know there is an issue, it is essential not to wait. Waiting and hoping they will come to you for help might lose valuable time getting them support. Talking to someone is often the first step when you know they are having a hard time. This way, you can find out what is troubling them and what you can do to help. Here are eight tips for talking about mental health: It is important to provide an open and non-judgemental space with no distractions. Let them lead the discussion at their own pace. Don’t pressure them to tell you anything they aren’t ready to talk about. Talking can take a lot of trust and courage. You might be the first person they have been able to talk to about this. You probably aren’t a medical expert, and while you may be happy to talk and offer support, you aren’t a trained counsellor. Try not to make assumptions about what is wrong or jump in too quickly with your own diagnosis or solutions. Say, ""Why don’t you tell me how you are feeling?"" rather than ""I can see you are feeling very low"". Try to keep your language neutral. Give the person time to answer and try not to grill them with too many questions. Discuss ways of de-stressing or practising self-care and ask if they find anything helpful. Exercising, having a healthy diet and getting a good night's sleep can help protect mental health and sustain wellbeing. Repeat what they have said back to them to ensure you have understood it. You don’t have to agree with what they are saying, but by showing you understand how they feel, you are letting them know you respect their feelings. You might want to offer to go to the GP with them or help them talk to a friend or family member. Try not to take control and allow them to make decisions. You will have your own limits on the support that you can provide. And it's important to take care of yourself too. Give yourself time to rest and process what they have told you or what’s happened. Try to help them create a support network of other friends, relatives and mental health professionals who can help them too. Remember that If you believe they are in immediate danger or have injuries that need medical attention, you must take urgent action to ensure they are safe. More details on dealing in a crisis can be found below. If it is a family member or close friend you are concerned about, they might not want to talk to you. Try not to take this personally: talking to someone you love can be difficult as they might be worried they are hurting you. It is important to keep being open and honest and telling them that you care. It may also be helpful to give them information about organisations or people they can reach out to. A list can be found below. People with mental health problems sometimes experience a crisis, such as feeling suicidal or experiencing their own or a different reality. You may also feel a sense of crisis, but staying calm is important. There are some general strategies that you can use to help: Seeing, hearing or believing things that no one else does can be the symptom of a mental health problem. It can be frightening and upsetting. Gently remind the person who you are and why you are there. Don’t reinforce or dismiss their experiences; acknowledge how the symptoms make them feel. If someone tells you they are feeling suicidal or can’t go on, it is very important to encourage them to get help. You or they should contact a GP or NHS 111. They can also contact theSamaritansimmediately by calling 116 123 (UK) for free anytime. They could also get help from their friends, family, or mental health services.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/tackling-social-inequalities-reduce-mental-health-problems,Tackling social inequalities to reduce mental health problems,"We all have mental health and we all can experience mental health problems, whatever our background or walk of life. But the risks of mental ill-health are not equally distributed. The likelihood of our developing a mental health problem is influenced by our biological makeup, and by the circumstances in which we are born, grow, live and age. Those who face the greatest disadvantages in life also face the greatest risks to their mental health. This unequal distribution of risk to our mental health is what we call mental health inequalities. This report describes the extent of inequalities that contribute to poor mental health in the UK today. It explains how certain circumstances interact with our individual risk and discusses communities that are facing vulnerabilities. It makes a clearly evidenced case for why addressing inequalities can help to reduce the prevalence of mental health problems and makes a strong call for cross-sectoral action on mental health. The report concludes with proposed actions to address mental health inequalities. For centuries, mental ill-health has been overlooked, misunderstood, stigmatised and, for a long time, inappropriately treated. Much of this is now changing, although misunderstanding andstigmaare not yet things of the past. As a society, we have some way to go before the extent of mental health problems and their damage to our individual and collective wellbeing is fully recognised and comprehensively responded to. Reducing mental health problems and their effects warrants the most urgent and committed public health effort of our generation. As this paper will show, addressing social, economic, cultural and environmental inequalities will take us a long way towards achieving this goal. Home of Mental Health Awareness Week"

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/about-mental-health,About mental health,"We all have mental health, just as we all have physical health. Our mental health is how we’re feeling inside, or how we are emotionally. It’s a bit like internal weather. Our mental health is at least as important as our physical health. It strongly affects our daily lives – how they feel to us, as well as our ability do the things we need and want to, including work, study, getting on with people and looking after ourselves and others. Another way to think about mental health is like thinking about the weather. As the seasons change, the weather does too. There are bright and sunny days which make us feel happy and want to do things like going outdoors, but on other days the weather can change to darker, rainy days, where you don’t feel like leaving the house. Like the weather, your mental health can go through periods of positive and bright bursts of energy, and it can also dip and drag you down a darker road. You may feel tired and lack motivation or energy to do the simple things, such as getting out of bed or getting on with your day. Whatever you are feeling, know that this is completely normal, and you can seek support or speak to family and friends about how you are feeling. Many people are reluctant to talk about their feelings and their mental health – there is still a stigma around it. Ironically, not sharing our feelings with anyone, or even knowing what they are, can make our mental health worse. Talking can help us find hope again, and feel closer to other people. Our mental health may change because of situations we’re in, things we’re doing and things beyond our control, including other people, our physical health, our finances and even the weather and world events such as the pandemic. All of us are affected by what happens to us, past and present. Things that happened even many years ago can affect our mental health today, for better or worse. Our genes also have an influence. When our mental health is good, we feel good inside. We might feel calm or content, peaceful, hopeful and accepting of ourselves and valued by the people who matter to us. Having good mental health makes life easier. It helps us to calm and comfort ourselves when we’re upset, to cope with the losses, changes, fears and uncertainties in life, to make and keep good relationships with other people and to learn. Having good mental health does not mean feeling good all the time. We all have our downs and ups. Life is full of unavoidable risks, worries and losses, which affect everyone. Sometimes difficult feelings pass quickly and we bounce back. Sometimes we struggle for much longer. This can happen to any of us. We can all do things to support and improve our mental health, and help prevent problems. OurHow to look after your mental health guidesinclude some suggestions about the best ways to do this. When our mental health is not so good, life feels more of a struggle. We might often feel sad or tearful, and hopeless and exhausted. We might feel under unbearable stress, or often worried about bad things happening to us or people we care about. All of these are very common experiences. Feeling down, anxious or stressed can mean we don’t have much energy for activities such as work or study, ‘life admin’ and looking after ourselves and others. It can be hard to keep going. Feeling like this for a while could be a sign that something else in our lives is wrong, or that we need help. It is also a natural reaction, if we’ve had a major loss or shock, such as bereavement, unemployment, divorce or a serious health problem. Some things are easier to change and some problems may be beyond our control. Sometimes we need help, with our mental health or with the situations causing us to struggle – for instance, debts or relationship problems. In these situations, the sooner we get support, the better. Read our tips on how to look after your own mental health. Home of Mental Health Awareness Week"

There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. A booklet for parents and carers wanting to know more about anxiety in children and young people. What do we mean byanxietyinchildren, and should parents be concerned about it? Many parents are unsure about when their child’s behaviour is something for them to worry about, or whether it is fairly typical behaviour for children of that age. Many parents are not sure whether to be concerned when a usually talkative 8-year-old becomes withdrawn and pre-occupied when an 11-year-old feels sick every school morning or when an adolescent suddenly begins to refuse to leave their room. It can often appear like a minefield for parents, trying to find out whether their child’s behaviour is expressing real worry or unhappiness, and if so, to understand what is behind it. For many years it was believed that children did not experiencedepressionoranxietyand that those who appeared to were merely malingering or attention-seeking. This is no longer the case. It is now widely accepted that as many as 8 to 11% of children and adolescents suffer from anxiety that affects their ability to get on with their lives. So what are anxiety disorders amongst children, what are they caused by and how can parents help children who are affected? All children, of whatever age, experience powerful emotions. The world of young children can be a frightening and uncertain place, as can that of adolescents, who are facing a time of rapid physical and emotional change. Many parents can remember times in their own childhood when they were very frightened, anxious, miserable or worried. Such feelings are part of growing up, and confronting the many changes being presented to us throughout childhood. Children are sensitive to what happens around them, and young children in particular can feel that it is their fault when things go wrong at home (such as parents becoming ill). This makes them feel worried and guilty. Section 2 examines the range of issues that can lead to children and young people becoming anxious. Not all children’s emotions are logical. Small children ordinarily have fears about the dark, insects, ghosts, kidnappers and getting lost or abandoned. Such fears are common and normal in all young children. Usually, children grow out of their fears but sometimes they persist as the child grows up - there are plenty of adults who are anxious about spiders or dogs. Only when such fears stop your child doing ordinary activities is there real cause for concern. Children can develop fears and phobias at any age, but they are especially common during early childhood, and again during puberty. Infants can appear to be upset, to be irritable and sleepless, but in very small children, such behaviour is more likely to be caused by hunger, cold, and physical diseases than anxiety. The situation is not so clear-cut as children get a little older. Certainly, it may appear to many parents of toddlers that their children are overly anxious or clinging. All toddlers express distress at being separated from their carers, along with occasional sleeplessness. Parents can help their children by offering them reassurance that everything is alright. It might feel as if your child clings excessively. Some children are naturally more timid and anxious than others, and for them, the stress of new experiences is greater than for other children. However, in time, this behaviour will usually pass. For other children, however, excessive clinging is a sign that they are extremely anxious. It is important when deciding what is excessive clinging in your child to take into account their nature, as well as what is happening within the child’s immediate environment. However, if your child clings so much that they are unable to play with other children, if they are unable to sleep alone, or be in a different room from you, this might indicate that they are overly anxious. Parents may worry that other behaviours in young children indicate that they are insecure or worried. However, often these are exactly the opposite. For example, many young children constantly carry comforting pieces of blanket or favourite toys. They do not indicate insecurity and there is nothing to be gained by removing a young child’s comfort object, in fact, there are grounds for thinking that children who have comfort objects are better able to cope than those who do not develop the habit. There are a number of things that parents can do to help children get through this stage of development. If you feel that your child is over-anxious, section 3 of this leaflet, sets out where you might go for help. Like young children, some school-age children can become over-anxious. This can be a real concern for parents and professionals working with them. Signs of anxiety in children of this age include children who: Some children will havepanic attacksin which they feel that it is difficult to breathe and that they are going to die. Anxious children can be irritable and demanding. They can also be a source of extreme worry for parents. In addition to this, it often takes a great deal of patience for parents to see that behind the difficult behaviour, there is anxiety and uncertainty. Many parents will respond angrily to their children’s behaviour, when what the children want is for their parents to be calm, to know exactly how they are feeling and why. If parents seem not to understand, children can feel that the parents are ignoring their feelings on purpose, which can in turn exacerbate their difficult behaviour. It is important for parents to try and talk calmly to children about the things that are worrying them, and to reassure them whenever possible. The teenage years can be a fraught time for adolescents and parents alike. It is a time of rapid physical development and emotional change and this can be very uncomfortable.Signs of anxietyamong adolescents might be revealed throughover-eating or under-eating, excessivesleepiness, andover-concern with appearance. Some adolescents will experience phobias and panic attacks may occur. For the majority of young people the feelings of uncertainty, turmoil and unhappiness that are all part of adolescence, do not mean that they will go on to develop more serious problems. However, for a minority of adolescents, specialist help may be necessary. Parents can play an important role in helping their children through this difficult time. Strategies that parents can develop include: When the young person’s anxiety is such that it is causing them prolonged distress or it is interfering with their lives; stopping them from going out with friends, or having relationships or hobbies, for example, then you might want to consider asking for professional help. For further information on where to go for help, see Section 3. There is a range of reasons why children and young people become anxious. In most cases, when children are extremely anxious there is a very real cause to this; perhaps they are having difficulties at school, (for example) being bullied. Anxiety can also have no apparent cause, but be very real in its own right, and cannot be overcome by willpower. However, attempts to get children to master their anxiety by telling them “not to be so silly” will fail. Below are a number of reasons why children and young people might become anxious. Being physically ill may cause children to become anxious. For example, if a child has a severe asthma attack, fears of dyingmay be aroused, or overprotective attitudes by parents or carers may be provoked. Children and young people with physical disabilities may be caused a great deal of anxiety as a result of other children’s responses to them. Young children feel insecure and threatened when they hear their parents rowing, especially when children hear threats by one parent to hurt the other, or to leave home, or when they overhear insults which they do not know whether to believe. Many parents, when faced with an unsympathetic partner, turn to their children, for support and a listening ear. This can be destructive for the child, placing them in an impossible situation and often resulting in the child feeling extremely anxious. During and after a row parents are angry and unlikely to be able to comfort their child. Either parent may be upset at a time when their child needs them. The parent may push them away, which can confirm the child’s sense of guilt at being somehow to blame. Parental separation and divorce are usually painful and distressing for children They continue to love the parent who leaves the home and cannot understand why their parents cannot live together. The child may think that it is their fault that their parents have separated, and this, in addition to divided loyalties between the parents, can result in the child feeling very insecure and anxious. It is important for parents who divorce to tell their children that they will not be abandoned and that the divorce is not their fault. It is also important not to criticise the other absent parent in the children’s hearing or ask the children to take sides. If a parent is ill, young children may also assume that this is their fault. Children readily think that the illness is because of something they thought or did (or didn’t do). Some children start to think that they should be ill or die themselves instead of their parent. This sort of thinking is very private and children do not talk about it easily. It is often wise to answer children’s questions about illness in a factual but not overly detailed way and take the opportunity to state that its cause was nothing to do with them. A few anxious parents ask their children for reassurance that they are loved by them, that they are doing the right thing, or that their children will never leave them in later life. This places a huge burden on children who easily come to believe that they are responsible for their parent’s state of mind. Parents should reassure children, not the other way around. Managing children’s behaviour is difficult. Clear instructions and the use of praise, coupled with clear limits to bad behaviour such as sending children to their room or withdrawing privileges, are usually sufficient. However, a few parents find that these are too difficult or insufficient and resort to issuing wild threats. After a while, most children discover that these are bluffs and the harassed parent makes the threats more terrifying. When these involve threats of abandoning the child (“I’ll put you in a home”... “I’ll just go away one of these days...”) children can become seriously anxious. This can result in making them feel irritable so that they offend the parent more and the threats intensify. Positive disciplining, giving encouragement to the child’s good behaviour and not constantly highlighting the bad, can be a much more effective way of promoting the desired behaviour and increasing your child’s confidence. Bullying, rejection and teasing are widespread in schools. It can sometimes be difficult for adults to understand the distress and misery bullying causes, especially if the bullying is “only” teasing and name-calling. But being persistently teased can make children very unhappy. It can lead to low self-esteem, with the child feeling that they deserve to be bullied. It can also lead to problems in later life. Some adults who were bullied as children find that they often getdepressed, lack self-confidence and feel resentful. There are positive steps that schools can take to stop bullying. Effective ways include the school making it clear that all pupils have a right not to be bullied, encouraging pupils that is not wrong to “tell” and that when bullying occurs measures will be taken to stop it. Parents too can play an important role in supporting children who have been bullied; by listening to what the child is saying about their experiences and believing them, and by working with them to rebuild their sense of self-esteem. Children can become extremely depressed as a result of unattainable academic expectations that they feel teachers or parents have of them. For example, consistent low achievement, or a fear of failure can lead to a child fearing rejection from parents and friends and becoming extremely anxious. Constant encouragement and support is the best way of encouraging children to fulfil their potential. Some teachers and children just do not hit it off. If you think that your child is being treated unfairly by a teacher, take it up with that teacher but not in a confrontational way. Parents do not always realise that children can be very different at home than at school. There are a host of things which children, especially teenagers can get anxious about. Worries about girlfriends and boyfriends are near the top of the list. Anxieties about getting into trouble with authorities such as the police sometimes feature. If parents have managed to keep talking to their children then it is more likely that they will ask for their help with anything which is worrying them. It is common sense that a child may learn to fear something because of a frightening experience. More perplexing are the irrational phobias which some children develop. Mostly these are severe forms of the common fears which affect many young children, but in the teens, more complicated fears can develop. When these cannot be reasoned away and prevent someone from carrying out ordinary activities they are called phobias. Several characteristic patterns of phobias are recognised in children and teenagers. It is not uncommon for teenagers to be shy, but if a fear of talking or eating in public or of being looked at becomes so strong the young person cannot face other people at all, then a phobia has developed. Just as with adults, some teenagers (but not young children) come to fear open spaces, waiting in queues, and brightly lit public places. This may stop them from being able to attend school or take part in social activities. Many children are fearful of starting a new school but get over their anxiety within a few days of actually attending. A few children, however, develop a powerful fear of attending school and find themselves unable to leave home and go to school - even though they may have said they intend to go. This often becomes an issue after a child has been off school for a while, for example as a result of a lengthy illness. Anxious repetitive thoughts that crowd the mind and are difficult to get rid of (even though the person knows they are senseless) are obsessions. Often, they give rise to compulsive rituals such as counting, hand-washing or cleaning, which are intended to ward off such thoughts or deal with the anxieties that they produce. For instance, children may feel they have to say good night nine times or they might die in their sleep. These obsessive rituals can be unpleasant and severe, much more distressing than the simple rituals that children put into their games. Their cause is not known but it is now recognised that they are not as uncommon in childhood as was once thought. A frequent cause of stress for many young people, and also increasingly for children, is their appearance and the desire to be thin, resulting in many children and young people experimenting with diets or refusing to eat certain foods. For some young people, a difficultrelationship with foodcan become a serious eating problem that can have a damaging effect on their physical and emotional health. Children and young people withanorexia nervosahave an extreme fear of normal body weight and feel fat, even when they have lost a great deal of weight. The young person may starve themselves by eating only tiny quantities of food, many may also take quantities of laxatives and may exercise vigorously in order to lose more weight. Anorexia affects many more girls than boys, although boys do suffer from this too. Bulimiatends to affect slightly older people, although adolescents can suffer from it. People with bulimia gorge themselves onfood in “binges” and then make themselves sick to get rid of the food. They may also take large numbers of laxatives. They maynot look overweight or underweight, which can make their eating problems difficult to detect. Continuous bingeing and vomitingcan eventually do serious harm to the body. As well as having a serious effect on a young person’s physical health,eating disordersare often a sign that something is troubling them emotionally. They may be linked to unhappiness at home, pressures at school or major changes to family life. Another worrying sign of distress and depression amongst young people isself-harming behaviour. Young women are twice as likely to self-harm as young men. The most common form of self-harming behaviour is cutting but it can also include bruising, scraping, burning or other self-inflicted wounds. These injuries can release feelings of self-hatred, anger and anxiety, and can provide a means of self-punishment or of taking control. It used to be believed that self-harming behaviour was “attention-seeking”, however, there is now a greater understanding of the underlying problems and low self-worth associated with self-injury. Help should be available to all young people who self-harm, both immediately following episodes of self-harming and follow-up help. This is especially important as a number of young people who self-harm do also attempt suicide. Suicideamongst 15- to 24-year-old young men increased by 85% from 1980 to 1990. A variety of causes are seen to be responsible for this:fear of unemployment, an increase indrug use, having parents with marital problems or inconsistent parental discipline, and crises in relationships. Young people who revealsuicidal behaviour or thoughtsshould receive medical help, initially from the General Practitioner but also more specialist help. In addition to this, young people should receive social support, which might include support from a socialworker or a support group. Parents have a key role to play as well, encouraging the young person to talk about their difficulties anddiscuss with them ways of coping with difficult circumstances. It is clear that a number of causes of general anxiety in childhood can be prevented or managed by sensible handling. This is also true for many of the specific fears - as has been outlined in this leaflet, there are practical things that parents can do when these arise. For the illogical fears which are not severe enough to be called phobias, simple explanations and reassurance will help many children gradually get over them. Anxiety or fear which is causing the child or teenager prolonged distress, or is interfering with everyday events such as goingout with family or friends or having relationships or hobbies, will often need special treatment. This treatment will nearly alwaystake place in a clinic without the child having to be admitted to the hospital. There are a number of professionals who can help children and young people who are extremely anxious. An important starting point in getting help for your child is oftenyour local GP. It is important to be clear with the GP about the nature of your worries, and s/he should carry out a detailed interview with you and your child, enquiring into such areas as the relationship between you and your child, concerns regarding school and friends, and other difficulties that your child might be experiencing. Some GPs have counsellors attached to their practices, and they might suggest that your child talks to the counsellor about their anxiety, or they might refer them to counsellors outside the practice. For other children and young people, the GP might feel that more specialist help is appropriate. If this is the case, they will refer your child to another professional for further assessment. These will most likely be: It is very unusual for anxious children to be treated with drugs although someobsessional problemsand a few young people withpanic attacksmay find these helpful. Anxiety and fear are unpleasant and can be the cause of substantial suffering in childhood and adolescence. Within the National Health Service there are a number of professionals, particularly within the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology Services, who are experts in such matters. If you think that your child or teenager is unusually anxious, you may be able to use the information in this booklet to help matters yourself. There are also helplines for parents to discuss worries and concerns confidentially. These can also refer you to sources of specialist help in your local area. For more information on these, see Section 4. Otherwise, you can go to your GP who may be able to help directly or will refer your child to the most appropriate local service. Again, if you are unsure what this will entail, do not be afraid to ask. There are many organisations, listed in Section 4 that will be able to help you. Asking for help does not mean that your child is seriously disturbed nor does it mean that they are going to be taken away from you or admitted to hospital against your will. It does mean that they will be helped.

All political parties in Northern Ireland agree that mental health is important, yet there is no sustained programme to prevent mental health problems. Who will commit to taking action that empowers every person and community in Northern Ireland to thrive with good mental health? Our mental health is a powerful asset. It's a key that allows us to unlock a wide range of health and social advantages. Yet mental health problems are currently costing Northern Ireland's economy £3.4 billion each year. As we emerge from the coronavirus pandemic, it is critical that the Northern Ireland Executive invests in strategies to prevent mental health problems in all stages of life. Northern Ireland has the highest rates of poor mental health of any of the four UK jurisdictions Mental health problems are the single largest cause of ill health and disability in Northern Ireland. One in five adults in Northern Ireland has experienced a mental health problem. Prior to the pandemic, one in eight children had emotional difficulty indicating psychological distress.

We welcome plans for developing a holistic network of support services alongside a cash-first approach. The link between household food insecurity and poor mental health should be made much more explicit and therefore we recommend that elements of the approach and plan be reviewed to reflect the impact of food scarcity on mental health throughout. The Foundation recommends that mental health providers and advocates form an integral part of any holistic support service network to ensure that those who live in poverty and who have been forced to use food banks receive the right support to improve their mental health and wellbeing and that related policy developments adopt a mentally healthy approach.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/perinatal-mental-health-services-consultation,Perinatal Mental Health Services Consultation,"Location:Scotland 1. How can the Scottish Government improve perinatal mental health services in Scotland, both in the short term and over the next five years? In 2019, the Perinatal Mental Health Network published an extensive report highlighting the lack of provision for perinatal mental health support across Scotland. Their report Delivering Effective Services: Needs Assessment and Service Recommendations for Specialist and Universal Perinatal Mental Health Services, provides a wide-ranging roadmap for the improvement of perinatal mental health services. The Foundation supports its recommendations and would like to see them implemented in full. 2. How has the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the mental health of new mothers and the support available to them during the perinatal period? The Coronavirus: Mental Health in the Pandemic study, led by the Mental Health Foundation in partnership with Queens University Belfast, University of Strathclyde, University of Swansea and Cambridge University, has shown that lone parents were a high-risk group for self-reported emotional and mental distress during the pandemic. Our survey of people’s mental health and wellbeing during the coronavirus pandemic was completed by between 1,015 and 2,037 adults in Scotland at various stages during 2020 and into 2021 and has identified that this has had a particularly detrimental effect on the mental health and wellbeing of women. In March 2020 we identified that considerably more women than men reported feeling panicked (29% vs 12%), anxious or worried (70% vs 56%) and hopeless (20% vs 10%) as a result of the pandemic. Subsequently, in a further poll of Scottish adults in March 2021, it was identified that women continued to report experiencing the mental health effects of the pandemic more acutely than men, with twice as many women than men feeling panicked (14% vs 7%) and considerably more women continuing to report feeling anxious (51% vs 36%), hopeless (23% vs 18%) and frustrated (52% vs 45%). Women were also more likely to have concerns about the pandemic exacerbating an existing mental health difficulty (32% vs 27%), as well as concerns surrounding their ability to access health services (37% vs 27%). 3. How has the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the mental health of those who have experienced the death of a baby, and the support available to them? According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the social restriction measures entailed, parents who lost a baby during this period were additionally faced by a loss of the usual emotional support which would have been offered by services. This included a loss of direct face-to-face support from clinical services, voluntary sector and peer support services. It is essential that as we prepare for further potential lockdowns, ways of ensuring parents who are exposed to this incredibly distressing experience, are still able to receive the emotional support they require. 15th Oct 2025

Despite the report being published prior to the onset of COVID-19, the issues outlined in this report, e.g., poverty, body image, sleep, technology, academic pressure, and issues related to identity, remain relevant for children and young people’s lives today. These issues are explored in further detail throughout this response. Childhood and young adulthood represent a particularly important time for development, wellbeing, and mental health. Some research suggests that around half of mental health problems develop by the mid-teens, with three-quarters established by the mid-twenties.

Our mental health is determined by our environments and life experiences. Our local authorities make choices every day that affect the well-being of tens of thousands of people. Local councillors have the power to influence decisions that will create safe, healthy communities that enable people to thrive. If elected, will you support actions that build well-being communities for all? Mental health problems of all kinds can be prevented. Our mental health is a powerful asset. It is a key that allows us to unlock a wide range of health and social advantages. Yet mental health problems are currently costing the Scottish economy £8.8 billion per annum. This figure represents half of what the Scottish Government spent on health and sport in the 2021-22 financial year. As we emerge from the Coronavirus pandemic, it is critical that councils invest in strategies to prevent mental health problems in all stages of life. For too long we’ve been firefighting by supporting people in crisis – addressing people’s mental well-being only after difficulties have arisen whilst the demand and pressure on frontline acute services continue to grow. Whilst these services are vitally important, they won’t, alone, reduce the number of people experiencing emotional distress. We should re-balance our efforts towards prevention by addressing the root causes of poor mental health. The local government is well-placed to deliver transformational investment in community initiatives to promote good mental health. It is also important that all council departments, local health boards and health and social care partnerships work together for the effective prevention of mental health problems. Councillors elected in May should commit to the following actions to improve public mental health in their communities. We have to stop thinking about mental health in a silo. All government departments including health, education, housing, employment, transport, culture, and justice can and should take action to promote good mental health. Councils are well-placed to work in partnership with local third sector organisations to deliver a range of new mental health supports through community-based groups. Everyday contact with nature is an important need for many and vital in keeping us emotionally, psychologically, and physically healthy. Spending time in green spaces, such as parks, is linked to improved life satisfaction, reduced anxiety, and increased happiness. Childhood and young adulthood represent a particularly important time for development, well-being, and mental health. Some research suggests that around half of mental health problems develop by the mid-teens, with three-quarters established by the mid-twenties. As Scotland emerges from the coronavirus pandemic, there is an invaluable opportunity to put the prevention of mental health problems at the heart of the public policy agenda. The local government is well-placed to deliver local assets and opportunities in a way that delivers good mental health for all. Our four recommendations, if adopted, would leverage local community actors across the nation and make a real difference in Scotland’s public mental health outcomes. 15th Oct 2025

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/economic-case-investing-prevention-mental-health-conditions-UK,Investing in prevention of mental health conditions,"Our mental health is a powerful asset. It is a key that allows us to unlock a wide range of health and social advantages. As we emerge from the coronavirus pandemic, it is critical that all UK governments invest in strategies to prevent mental health problems in all stages of life. This report outlines some key well evidenced interventions which have the potential to achieve this, and through doing so, reduce distress in the population. This report provides an economic case for the prevention of poor mental health. In 2019, there were 10.3 million instances of poor mental health in the UK. Among health conditions,depressionalone was the third highest ranking cause of disability. This means mental health problems affect the lives of millions of people across the UK. However, in addition to the personal impact on people, families and communities, poor mental health costs a significant amount to the UK economy, through costs related to healthcare, time out of work and the impacts associated with support from informal care. Our mental health is determined by a range of factors, including our social and economic circumstances. This means that much poor mental health could be avoided by investment inpreventionand early intervention measures. This includes actions that address the social and economic circumstances that influence mental health, such as reducing poverty and providingsafe green spaces. It can also include measures aimed at the family and individual levels, such as interventions to support parenting and families’ coping strategies. In this report, we first provide an estimate of the annual costs of mental health problems in the UK. Next, we look at a broad range of evidenced interventions for the prevention of mental health problems. There are many ways of preventing mental health problems; including preventing them before they have started and preventing them from becoming more severe once they have already emerged. In this report we have focused on ‘primary prevention’, which describes measures that aim to intervene before mental health problems have occurred. The report takes a life-course perspective, as there are risks to mental health from the beginning of life, and then at different transition points, such as starting school, moving from school to further or higher education, then to work, and from work to retirement. We highlight areas where there is strong evidence of both effectiveness in reducing poor mental health and of cost-effectiveness, as well as those we consider to be promising for economic evaluation. We discuss some of the challenges with this evidence base and look at how it can be strengthened. Home of Mental Health Awareness Week"
https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/standing-together-cymru-report,Standing Together Cymru report,"Location:Wales Our evaluation of the Standing Together Cymru project, the culmination of three years of work which adapted to meet the challenge of the pandemic, wasreleased to mark a very special day in Wales, St David’s Day. Established with the aims of reducing the loneliness and isolation of participants and improving their emotional wellbeing, the project facilitated connections between tenants through meaningful activity. The group offered peer support and increased community engagement. This was particularly pertinent at a time when access to the outside world and day-to-day activities were halted due to the risk of COVID-19 and the ensuing restrictions - when participants reported a huge sense of loss, but which also provided a unique opportunity for them to connect with one another. Peer supportinvolves people sharing knowledge, support and practical advice with each other. A large evidence-based review, summarising evidence from over 1,000 studies, has shown that peer support has the potential to improve the life experience of those diagnosed with long-term physical and mental health conditions. The project, funded by the Welsh Big Lottery, ran in partnership with four housing associations across South East Wales: Melin Homes, Derwen Cymru, United Welsh and Newport City Homes. These covered 22 housing schemes, supporting the 211 tenants who live there (195 people attended in person with 16 continuing over the telephone/virtually at the height of the restrictions). Standing Together Cymru built on the Mental Health Foundation’s proud history of facilitating peer support groups in Wales since 2010. The Project Evaluation highlights the importance of addressing loneliness by building social connections. The Empowerment and Later Life Team at MHF adapted all projects in the pandemic from face-to-face to remote delivery, post, phone and virtual. Our currentPicture This programmeprovides computers tablets and customised training to get older people who have previously been digitally exclude online and connecting virtually, using creative virtual sessions to address loneliness. Wales has a large and growing older people’s population - by 2030, it is projected that there will be just over 1 million older people in Wales, which is 33% (nearly one third) of the total population - 45% of whom live alone. Many older people report sub-optimal feelings of wellbeing. The need for social connection is of paramount importance to living a healthy life and maintaining resilience, and one way this can be realised is through community engagement. An evaluation of the project showed that whilst physical health challenges increased during the lifespan of the project, wellbeing was maintained – no mean feat, given what we know people have endured over the last two years. The project was measured against the World Health Organisation (WHO)’s 5-Five Wellbeing index measure of wellbeing and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)’s 3 item loneliness scale. The outcomes revealed a decrease in overall health, but maintenance of wellbeing and positive feelings of inclusion. We hope the findings will be of interest to the Older People’s Commissioner for Wales in realising her Ageing Well priority and show the value to Local Authorities of commissioning peer support groups when considering the needs of older people. We welcomed theOlder Person’s Strategypublished last year (October 2021) and ask that older people be recognised as a group experiencing inequality.  We would like to see their distinct needs met in the new Welsh Government mental health strategy and considered when the current strategy is reviewed later this year. Issues affecting the mental health of older people include digital exclusion and digital literacy, age-related poverty, poor access to health and social care services and ageism. Addressing these needs through a cross-governmental prevention approach should be a key measure for assessing the success of the next mental health strategy. Home of Mental Health Awareness Week"

Even if we're not directly involved, watching events unfold, particularly those causing harm or human suffering, can affect our mental health. After learning about global events that cause uncertainty, you may feel fear, anxiety or a loss of control over your own life and plans. You may worry for the safety of strangers, loved ones or yourself. And if you have lived through similar events in the past or share things in common with those affected, it may bring up traumatic memories or feelings. Know that whatever you feel is valid. Know that we care about you and your mental health. And know that you are not alone in this. We have created some advice to help you cope and support your loved ones during these uncertain times. Ask yourself, ""how much information and disturbing world news am I currently taking in? And how does it make me feel?"" If it’s having a negative effect on how you feel, try to: After you’ve had a break, ask yourself ""how do I feel now that I’ve had a space from the news?"" If you find that the break has helped, then try to continue: Over and above those, try to be intentional in how you are consuming news, and, as much as you can, avoid long 'scrolling through' sessions. Try to accept that, although we may want to help or change the current global and national situation, some of these things may be out of our control. We talk about ways that you can meaningfully engage or feel empowered in the sections below. If the horror or uncertainty of the news is bringing about feelings of anxiety, fear, helplessness or isolation, remember that there are always other people who are feeling the exact same way right now. There are things that we can do to cope with or alleviate these feelings. You can connect with others who are impacted in your community. This may be in your local area or online communities. This can help you to feel more empowered and less alone. Connect with your community by: Humans are neurologically wired to connect with others. Helping others and engaging with our local community in a meaningful way is good for our mental health. You may feel powerless if you have opinions on what is happening in the world but can't express them. You may feel powerless if you don’t know what to do with your opinions or passion for change. Here are some ways that you can empower your voice and feel less out of control: Civic and political activism may make you feel more empowered and give you an avenue to express your thoughts in a constructive way. When talking to other people about world news, if a topic comes up which you disagree on, try to focus on active listening, respectful discussion and assertive communication. Being drawn into highly polarised or disrespectful conversations usually has an adverse effect on our wellbeing. If a comment upsets you, try to take a break, pause the conversation and come back when you feel ready. When you feel overwhelmed, try to reach out for support. There are people and organisations that want to help: You could also try to express how you are feeling through creativity. You could write in a journal, listen to an emotive song, draw or dance. Express in a way that feels right for you. Try to stay with those activities for at least a few minutes to unlock their protective effects on your wellbeing. Try to keep allocating time to things, activities and actions that are good for your mental health. What works will be different for each person, so tune into what is right for you. Here are a few things to get your started. Try to: All of these can help you to feel better and to take your mind off the stress of the news cycle. Finally, if you feel that scary world news is affecting your children, then use our guide totalking to your children about scary world newsto help you have open and honest conversations at home.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/hs-story-how-healthy-relationships-are-important-my-mental-health,Healthy relationships are good for mental health,"This content mentions depression and personality disorders, which some people may find triggering. Hi! I'm H, I'm 20 years old and I'm writing this blog to talk about how mental health and healthy relationships coexist together. I am somebody who hasdepression, apersonality disorder, and I haveautism. I can sometimes find it hard to form healthy relationships with others. I personally think, when in a relationship, these things are key: Having a relationship where you can communicate is very important, as it helps to stimulate a person’s brain when talking to their significant other about how they feel. I and other people with depression sometimes feel lonely like I have no one to talk to, see or engage with. When people feel comfortable in themselves and have confidence and self-esteem, they will be able to form healthy relationships with themselves. When building a relationship, don't be someone who's fake, not the real you, be yourself. Being somebody else when in a relationship isn't good for you or the person that you're with. It can make your life harder and that person may not be able to trust you. It's always best to be yourself no matter what. Even when social media contributes to ideas about people being a certain way or a certain height or weight, that shouldn’t stop you from forming a healthy bond with somebody, where you can be yourself. I don't know much about relationships, but I have seen from others, especially my friends who have been in very negative relationships. I've also picked up on other people's mistakes and made sure I don’t make the same mistakes. Having strong friendships is really important. A friend should always have your back in situations you can't get out of and stand up for you. You don't need thousands of millions of friends. What is important is those friends who are there for you all the time and you’re there for them. That is what makes a strong friendship. For me, when you feel sad, or you just want to rant and scream and that person is willing to listen, then that's a good friend and someone who accepts you for who you are! The qualities I bring to my friends are that I am quite funny. I've got a good sense of humour and I sometimes joke a lot, often with sarcastic humour. I have a few friends who I trust, who I know won't backbite me, or bully me for the way I look or dress. I would rather have one friend than many people who I can feel normal with and be myself around. Someone who can listen when I feel down, and I can help them out as well. Forming and making friendships can be daunting and scary but when you get to know that person, only you get to see their true colours. Honestly, I think young people should learn about healthy relationships because it will be beneficial for them to understand that everything isn't what you see on social media, (e.g. like movies and dramas or even reality TV shows). Although young people need to be more aware of the decision or choice they are making towards, committing a relationship with someone. Many young people don't have the chance to hear how to manage a healthy relationship with their families and friends on how to manage a healthy relationship, so I'm excited to help you, young people out. Relationships come in many ways such as having a bond with someone in your family or being close to a childhood friend, or it could be starting a new intimate relationship with someone. Some of you who may have had bad relationships in the past shouldn't stop you from forming new memories/ones. You as a young person can only decide what to do next or how to change the situation you're in!

We’ve used the term LGBTIQ+ on this page, but we realise this doesn’t cover all the ways people define their gender or sexuality.Stonewall has a glossarythat lists many more terms. Mental health problems such as depression, self-harm, alcohol and drug abuse and suicidal thoughts can affect anyone, but they’re more common among people who are LGBTIQ+. Being LGBTIQ+ doesn’t cause these problems. But some things LGBTIQ+ people go through can affect their mental health, such as discrimination, homophobia or transphobia, social isolation, rejection, and difficult experiences of coming out. It’s important to note that embracing being LGBTIQ+ can have a positive impact on someone’s well-being too. It might mean they have more confidence, a sense of belonging to a community, feelings of relief and self-acceptance, and better relationships with friends and family. Being LGBTIQ+ doesn’t automatically mean someone will have mental health issues but may mean they’re at higher risk of experiencing poor mental health. A study by Stonewall found that over the previous year: ‘Hate crimes’ are crimes committed against people because of their race, sexuality, religion, gender identity or disability. Members of the LGBTIQ+ community are at a greater risk of experiencing hate crimes compared to heterosexual people. Certain LGBTIQ+ groups are at particular risk, including gay men, young people and those who are from Black, Asian and ethnic minority groups. If you have experienced a hate crime, report it by calling 999 in an emergency or 101 at other times to contact your local police force. Stonewall has information onmore ways to report hate crimes. Around one in eight LGBTIQ+ people have experienced unequal treatment from healthcare staff because they are LGBTIQ+. One in seven have avoided treatment for fear of discrimination. Healthcare providers have a legal duty under the Equality Act 2010 to treat LGBTIQ+ people fairly. If you’ve experienced discrimination by a healthcare provider, you don’t have to put up with it.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/about-mental-health-problems,About mental health problems,"Mental health problems are very common. In a single week, at least one in six of us has problems with our mental health, according to the government’smajor studyof adults in England. Mental Health problems are difficult experiences that make it harder for us to get on with our lives. They include the painful feelings and thoughts that we all have at times – including periods of sadness, hopelessness and fear. Mental health problems are not a weakness – they are just responses to what is happening, and what has happened, to us and around us. For example, we might feel tense, worried and afraid – a common experience often described as ‘anxiety’. This might affect our sleep, eating, work, studies and dealings with people in our lives, as well as alcohol and drug use. Other people might not know how we’re feeling, unless we tell them. Getting supportfrom other people, andlooking after our mental health, can help us get past problems like this and prevent them becoming more serious or long-term. Changing our lives to tackle the causes of our distress will also help – if this is possible. Most people who have problems with their mental health can get over them or learn to live with them, especially if they get help early on. Some mental health problems cause us more serious distress and problems with our lives, and may continue for years. For instance, hearing and seeing things that others can’t see, or believing that other people are out to get us, can cause conflicts with other people. As a result, we may lose jobs, friends, children, housing and even our liberty and lives. Mental health problems are not like cancer or heart disease, where scientific tests can reveal what is wrong. With mental health problems, it’s our painful feelings and thoughts, and their effects on our lives, that are the difficulty. There’s no ‘hidden’ part that only experts understand. This may seem confusing, because people who work in mental health often use medical terms such as ‘anxiety’, ‘depression’, ‘bipolar’ and ‘bulimia’ to diagnose people’s problems with their mental health. According to this view, getting the diagnosis right helps to get the treatment right. Some people find it helps them to have a mental health diagnosis. It can come as a relief and help them understand and accept themselves – and also help others to do so. In addition, a diagnosis can help with getting benefits, support at work or with studies and treatment from health professionals. Other people feel harmed by diagnosis. They feel worse about themselves as a result of the label they’ve been given, or fear it will make others wary of them – potential employers, friends, partners and mental health professionals, for instance. There is much concern that people with a mental health diagnosis are too often seen as no more their diagnosis, rather than as a whole, living person who changes as their live unfolds. This can have a profoundly harmful effect on their quality of life. It’s worth remembering that a mental health diagnosis is no more than a health professional’s opinion about the experiences another person is having. Another professional might have a different opinion. Diagnoses also change with society. Until the early 1970s, for instance, psychiatrists ruled that being gay was a ‘mental illness’. Eventually, campaigners (including some psychiatrists) persuaded the influential American Psychiatric Association to change its view. Overnight, millions of people were ’cured’. Despite the controversy around mental health diagnoses, medical terms remain the most common way to describe problems mental health.

I’m Libby, I’m 22 and I live near Wakefield. For the last four years, I have worked as a carer in the community. I have experiencedlonelinessmyself and also amongst those I helped throughout the pandemic, many people’s mental health deteriorated during this time. I’ve had poor mental health in the past. I was caught up in the Manchester bombings in 2017 and that really impacted my mental health, I was scared. I had therapy which helped, but when the pandemic happened and we all had to keep ourselves apart, I felt really excluded and alone. People were scared and everyone kept themselves at home - it was what we had to do. Personally, I found it tough, I felt very lonely and it was hard to keep positive. I was constantly on my phone and talking to friends. Because of thetherapyI’ve had, I knew that I had to keep my mind busy. Even when I felt low and like I didn’t want to talk to people I tried to keep those connections going. When you’re on your own, it’s easy to feel like you don’t want to do anything. It’s my job to help people. As a companionship carer, I see people in their homes, I’m in that community and I feel that connection. It was upsetting to see how quickly people deteriorated during the pandemic. We did lots of welfare calls to keep in contact and try to keep people's spirits up, but the loneliness was crippling. Even people with no previous experience of poor mental health were really low and depressed. A lot of the people I care for told me that they felt they weren’t supposed to be here anymore. I felt really vulnerable - I could see people suffering and I couldn’t help them in the way I wanted to, because we were all stuck at home. Alongside feeling lonely myself, I also felt really guilty. I wanted to help and do more but I physically couldn’t because I was already giving as much support as I could. We all need human connection and my way of coping was to speak with my family and friends. I did my best to keep in touch with everyone, give them ideas and encourage them to do things. I think it’s important to keep your mind busy and keep a positive mindset. I know when I talk to people through my work, even if it’s only for half an hour, I can have a big impact. We’ll do a jigsaw together, or have a chat about something we’ve seen on the telly. Little things matter and something as simple as a conversation can make a big difference. There’s always someone to talk to - even if it’s just over the phone or on a video call. You’re never on your own - you have to put your trust in the person you’re talking to and get things out. I always feel better when I can express myself and say how I’m feeling, even if it feels scary. And when you share your own feelings, you can ask other people how they’re doing too. I like to get my friends' thoughts on things, I ask if they have ideas to help. It means we can work together to make a plan and make things better. I found strength in trying to support other people. Prioritising my friends and family, and making sure that they were ok gave me purpose and something to focus on. I’m not sure I realised it at the time, but by looking after other people, I was looking after myself and those connections helped me to feel less lonely. Keeping your mind busy and finding something to do is helpful. To anyone who is lonely now, and feels that their mental health is suffering, I’d say take a moment. Take a deep breath and make a call. Talking to someone and making that connection is so important. And it’s important to remember that this feeling of loneliness won’t last forever. There is a future. It’s springtime now and summer is around the corner. Get outside and feel the sunshine on your face - there is still enjoyment to be had and things that make us smile.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/larysas-story-my-loneliness-after-arriving-uk-after-conflict-eastern-ukraine,My loneliness after arriving in the UK,"This content mentions loneliness and trauma, which some people may find triggering. Larysa talks about her experience of arriving in the UK after the conflict in Eastern Ukraine, not having any friends in her new home in Cardiff and connecting with anotherrefugeefrom Yemen. Finding someone who knew how she felt helped her start to rebuild trust. I’m Larysa and I arrived in the UK in 2014 after fleeing conflict in Eastern Ukraine. I arrived with my husband and three children but experienced new feelings oflonelinessand guilt after escaping the war. There are times in life when you feel lonely. But until I arrived in the UK these moments were always short. In Ukraine, I had lots of friends. But when I arrived in Cardiff my only friend was the English language. I knew no one and it was a difficult time. I didn’t realise I was lonely, but looking back it’s obvious. Because we had to flee, our vision of safety was turned upside down. We lost the ability to plan, to dream and to do simple functional things. Everything was taken from us. Most of all, our ability to trust was taken. We were in the asylum process for seven years, and for the first two years, I couldn’t make connections with people. If I spoke to the GP or someone from a charity, I worried if they would keep what I told them safe. Our own identities were so transformed it was hard even to speak to other asylum seekers. I didn’t see myself in the same situation. Our identities changed overnight - I was a teacher and then I was an asylum seeker. I didn’t feel I could speak to my parents or friends who were still in Ukraine. They were being shelled and their homes were destroyed. I felt incredible guilt and shame at having left, and that feeling eats away at you. I thought that if I’d stayed I could have protected my family and friends. I stopped contacting people. I didn’t feel I could tell them about my life while they experienced the trauma of war. I didn’t have the words to support them and felt useless. It became easier for me not to contact them. If people messaged me of course I would reply, but I didn’t contact people myself. I got a scholarship to study for my master's and took time to learn about myself. I read a lot abouttraumaand began to understand why I felt shame. I understood it was not my fault that the war started. I wrote a list of my important friends and decided to call someone each week. I rang them and apologised, explaining why I hadn’t felt able to call. They said to me, “You’re silly for saying that. You saved your children! You didn’t betray us.” We’re back in touch and our friendship is strong and that means the world. But those two years without connection were very hard indeed. Mental and physical healthis connected. I started having pains in my leg and back - I felt I couldn’t walk. For my first two years in the UK, I didn’t want to see anyone. I didn’t want to be reminded of the unfairness of the world. Then one morning I woke up and asked myself who would take care of my children if I wasn’t here. I made myself get out of bed and started to take the first steps. I started volunteering to help otherasylum seekers and refugees. The first month was terrifying - every time the phone rang I was scared. But then I started to feel helpful. I helped people with their English and it was the first time in three years I felt needed. And on days when I felt low, I knew I was around people with similar experiences. One day, I was teaching a class and a student from Yemen said “I know how it feels.” They looked into my eyes and I could see that understanding. The power of shared experience is very strong and I started to feel better. I started to rebuild trust and connect with people. No one can help you better than you can help yourself. It’s important to take time to know yourself and to understand how your mind and body work. Understand how things impact you too. I avoid mass media, it’s too upsetting and damaging to see the fake news and awful comments onsocial media. I use trusted channels to know what’s going on at home and ignore everything else - this approach allows me to function. It’s important to have days out too. Seeing new places, exploring and spending time with other people is special. Finding purpose through my work and volunteering has been huge. You can’t just stay in bed thinking about your purpose in life - you need to make the first steps. When you are feeling lonely, never be afraid to talk. At least one person in the world needs you and you must remember that. If you feel affected by the content you have read, please see ourget helppage for support. Home of Mental Health Awareness Week"
https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/foxs-story-being-disabled-and-feeling-isolation-together-being-queer-and-trans,Being disabled and the feeling of isolation,"This content mentions loneliness and isolation, which some people may find triggering. Fox talks about being disabled and the feeling oflonelinessbeing isolated in a rural setting, together with beingqueer and trans. Not being able to connect with his friends who lived far away had a huge effect on his mental health. My name is Fox* and I live in rural Northumberland. I’m disabled and unable to work. My isolation and loneliness exacerbate my mental health problems. I live in an incredibly remote part of north Northumberland. I feel incredibly lonely and isolated as a result. I am isolated partly because of my disabilities which means I am unable to work or to easily get around, but also because there is a lack of provision in my area - lots of the groups and support systems just do not seem to reach my part of the country. I don’t have a community that understands me and sometimes that means that even trying to access support feels like an impossible struggle. I’ve been excluded from social groups for most of my life because of myautism- that just seems to rub people up the wrong way. I am queer and trans and there isn’t really a community where I live at all. Not being able to connect with people like me has a huge impact. When I’m struggling, I’m not able to talk to anyone who has the remotest understanding of what I’m experiencing, and it is exhausting to have to explain my suffering and how I feel when I’m in need of help. I’ve lived here for ten years and the only time I could really socialise was when I was at school. It wasn’t ideal because my friends who lived in towns and villages could see each other much more. No one wanted to visit me because I was over an hour away from most of them. I don’t think it was intentional, but I was definitely excluded. Getting anywhere meant relying on the family car and lifts, but that’s tricky because we’re a big family and they were often busy. I’ve always been lonely. I live a mile and a half from the nearest bus stop and even when I was at school most of my friends lived more than 10 miles away. The buses only run four times a day, and you can never be sure that the bus will even turn up. I have a number of really close friends, but most of them live at the other end of the country. It’s really frustrating not to be able to spend time with the people I really want to see. It has had a huge hit on my mental health and self-esteem. I suffer from a variety of severe, long term and complex mental health problems and when I’m not at my worst I want to be doing things and be with the people I care about. And when I’m not able to I feel a sense of personal responsibility and like I’m wasting my good or less-bad times. Being isolated exacerbates my mental health conditions. I can’t get anywhere to get help and I can’t talk to anyone either. My partner provides support when I’m feeling low and I enjoy watching films and playing board games. My cats are a huge part of my life. I’m obsessed with them and they are a real comfort when I’m feeling low. Sometimes it’s not just the people around you who can make a difference - our pets can be the support we need. *To protect his confidentiality, Fox is an alias.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/carols-story-there-should-be-no-shame-how-we-feel,Carol's story: there should be no shame in how we feel,"This content mentions loneliness or isolation, death or bereavement and anxiety, which some people may find triggering. As the lockdown restrictions eased, her lack of friends and family meant that she really didn't have anyone to support her or empathise with how she was feeling. She talks about the things she did, like having a walk in the park and getting a dog, had a huge effect in dealing with her feelings ofloneliness. As Carol says ""there's nothing to be ashamed of in feeling this way."" My name's Carol and I'm in my sixties. I'm retired and live in Norfolk. I lost my husband suddenly just before lockdown and, in moving to a new area, found loneliness made my feelings worse. I don’t think we deal particularly well withdeath and bereavementas a society. I know it can be a very lonely place. People who I thought were good friends seemed to disappear overnight - as though dying might be contagious - or because they didn’t know what to say or do. My husband died in May 2019. He was a lot younger than me, so I didn’t expect him to die first. I didn’t expect to be a widow or alone as I reached retirement age. Six months after he died, I moved to a new area. So I experienced bereavement and lockdown in a place where I didn’t really know anyone. I found lockdown and bereavement a real battle. I think people underestimated the impact of lockdown on people in my position. If I hadn’t had Zoom, I think I’d have had a breakdown - it was the only contact I had with others. I didn’t want to get up some days. I didn’t see I had a future. I started drinking a little bit more and started to have moreanxiety. But as restrictions lifted, and people began to talk about a return to normality, for many of us that sense of loneliness grew. People were throwing open the doors of their homes and welcoming back family and friends, but I had no family and only a few friends but none who lived nearby. There were times when I felt like I didn’t want to go on, and that I had nothing to live for. I haven’t shared that with anyone because it sounds so dramatic and drastic, but that is how I felt. I didn’t acknowledge how low I was, and I know I put on a bit of a front. And I didn’t go to the doctor because I didn’t want to take medication. I realise now there’s no shame in it. It’s important to be open and not worry about what people think. But that is a difficult thing to do when you’re feeling low. I’m a lot better now. Some of the things that made a huge difference to me were the smallest of things -getting outdoorsand going for a walk. I also got a dog. I joined some local groups -a mindfulness classand a bereavement support group run by The Good Grief Trust. Being part of the group for other bereaved people was a huge turning point. I looked forward to the Wednesday lunchtime virtual Good Grief Café because it was an hour when I could connect with other people who understood what I was experiencing and I knew I wouldn’t be judged. Starting to do yoga again has been wonderful too. Through that class, I’ve met someone else there who is a widow, which has helped and we’ve been out for a coffee - it’s good to find people who understand my situation. I also started writing a journal to help get rid of some of the feelings of uselessness and hopelessness. Putting pen to paper and writing down my thoughts and feelings helped with my grieving too. My message to others would be to find ways to be a friend to yourself. I just wish I’d asked somebody for help - how different things might have been if I’d popped over to my neighbours and said ‘I’m feeling a bit down today, do you mind if we have a chat on the doorstep?’. Getting out into the open air and into nature makes a huge difference too. I’m fortunate to live only five minutes from a beach and even if I’m there on my own, it’s a reminder there’s a bigger world out there. I take photos and it’s really nice to look back at and to think ‘that was a nice moment’. It reminds me there are still lots of things to live for because the world does go on.

Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. Iona talks about the challenges of beingautisticand her feelings oflonelinessafter leaving school to go to university. Being outside her 'comfort zone' also had an effect on her mental health, but as she says in her story, ""starting with small things can help"". Volunteering and starting dance classes were her way of starting out on that journey I’m Iona and I'm 22. I live near Edinburgh and I’m studying English Literature and Creative Writing through the Open University alongside working as a mentor and consultant. I experienced an intense period of loneliness and poor mental health after leaving school. I was diagnosed asautisticwhen I was 19 and I find it impossible to separate this from myloneliness. I was really depressed before I got my diagnosis. Once I finished my National 5 exams and left school, I didn’t really leave the house. It affected my mental health badly, and isolation made things worse. It can be difficult to break the cycle. I knew I needed to change things but you can’t because you feel so bad and so you leave the house less and less and end up feeling worse and things just spiral. I think that modern society makes finding deep connections difficult too.Working, commuting,stress- it all adds up. Cities, in particular, seem designed to discourage a sense of community and to encourage feelings of isolation. Getting my diagnosis really turned things around. It helped me to understand why I felt isolated and what I could do about it. It enabled me to think differently about how I could move in society. Leaving school was significant too. For manyyoung people, it can feel like there are huge external pressures and expectations at a time in your life when you’re beginning to form your identity. It can feel overwhelming and you don’t have time to find out who you are and work out what you want to do with your life. I was living with my parents at the time and they were really quite worried about me but didn’t know what to do. I felt terrible. I got to the point whereI did want to end my life- I was so low and didn’t see there was any hope for change. Going outside of your comfort zone is really important. It’s hard, but starting with small things can help. I decided to start volunteering and signed up for the Saltire Awards, a scheme in Scotland where you can volunteer with different charities. Volunteering made me feel like I was contributing something meaningful and people recognised my skills and encouraged me. It really helped and eventually, I did an apprenticeship and got a job. I got to go to social events too, volunteering really did change my life in lots of ways. I went to dance classes too and that helped to build my confidence. And I used apps like Bumble and MeetUp to find people nearby looking to build new friendships or find people with similar interests. It’s important to find balance. If you are someone who likes solitude, giving yourself space for that is important as you start to build new connections and relationships. I like my own company to decompress. Being autistic means I get quite overwhelmed with sensory things and sometimes I need to have time to be alone or just have a day at home. A lot of autistic young people end up feeling isolated. It’s a big problem within our community. If you have problems with socialising or if you’ve been bullied, it can cause people to retreat. It’s especially important for young people to have time to focus on themselves. Be your own best friend first. As you navigate new friendships and connections, remember what you need and what you want. There have been times when I’ve had lots of acquaintances but still felt very lonely because I didn’t feel genuinely close to those people. Going to university was a turning point. Learning has woken up my mind. I’m using my brain and thinking about new ideas. I’ve had good results and feedback too, and that helps me to feel more confident. I don’t recognise myself from back then. When I was in my late teens, loneliness anddepressiontook over. My memory of the period is patchy and I just feel like an entirely different person today. I rarely turn opportunities down now. If something seems good I challenge myself to try it at least once. And I like to remind myself - when new things feel frightening - that things are never as bad as I think they may be! Things don’t improve overnight and it can take a long time for things to feel better. But as you try new things and meet new people, you are taking important steps. Keep doing what you’re doing.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/ashleighs-story-coping-physical-conditions-and-connecting-lgbtqia-groups,Coping with physical conditions,"This content mentions suicide or suicidal thoughts, abuse or violence, personality disorders and loneliness. Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. Ashleigh talks about life in Scotland,coping with physical and mental health conditions, being a victim of voyeurism and the help she got from her connections with local LGBT groups. Ashleigh says ""Talking to people and joining groups have provided me with a lot of reassurance and encouragement. It’s helped me to feel less lonely and part of a community, and that’s made all the difference."" I’m Ashleigh, I live in the Scottish Highlands and I’m studying at university as a distance learner. I have a number of physical and mental health conditions, which were exacerbated bylonelinessat particularly difficult points in my life. I have been alone with lots of things. In 2018, within the space of a few months, I found myselfhomeless, without work and without support. I’d escaped anabusive relationshipand then discovered that I’d been filmed covertly and without my knowledge in the bathroom at work - I was a victim of voyeurism. My response was to withdraw from everything. I stayed in bed for a very long time. I had to stop working because I had a mental breakdown. My family moved to Scotland and I was all alone. At that point, I received my diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder and things changed. I felt like I was viewing the world through a totally different lens. I’d known I was different from a very young age so my diagnosis was a relief in a sense. But I also felt completely isolated. When I was diagnosed, people withdrew because they didn’t understand. I was a bit of an emotional mess and no one wanted to be around me, so I withdrew even further. That period of transition was tough. I was very angry and very sad, andI felt suicidalall the time. I felt particularly lonely after I discovered I was the victim of voyeurism. I was the victim of a crime but was told not to talk about it. I was living in a homeless hostel and felt totally overwhelmed. The legal process took four years. I felt silenced - that was almost as damaging as the crime itself. My situation felt totally stagnant. It felt like there was nothing I could do and as though things would never get better. When I moved to Scotland in 2020, I was very purposeful in putting down roots. I jumped headfirst into joining a number of different organisations and charities. After my relationship break up, I really took time to understand myself and to enjoy my own company and it made it much easier for me to make connections. I joined an advocacy group on a bit of a whim. They were so kind and welcoming and really made me feel at ease. I’m part of a befriending project too and have a phone call once a fortnight from another university student. She’s there to listen and it helps to get things off my chest. I’m part of some LGBT groups in Scotland for young people too. There are some other people in the group with mental health conditions and I’ve had some really helpful conversations and debates. I still feel lonely, though in a different way. Now I’m in Scotland, I'm very far from my best friends in Essex. There are times when I want and need to be there for them, and can’t. I joined lots of online communities too. I’ve made lots of friends on Twitter and that’s been fantastic. People tell me I’m quite blunt and honest, but that’s just who I am. I feel like people understand me - I feel connected and informed and there’s a sense of belonging. I used Bumble to find friends as well. It’s not just for dating, you can join to find friends too! My profile says it like it is - that some of my limbs don’t behave because of my physical conditions and that I’ve got mental health problems. I think people with mental health issues often gravitate to each other because there’s a level of understanding. I’ve made some good friends but sometimes it’s a bit touch and go - people are going on their own journeys and we all need to prioritise ourselves sometimes. I am the most well I have been in over a decade. I still have lots going on but I do look back and think ‘gosh!’ I can’t believe I was that person or that I endured everything I did. Taking steps to be social and to have contact is important. So often we don’t know how to deal with things. We don’t know how to talk about things or confront things that are scary or troubling. Loneliness and mental health is something that isn’t discussed enough. Talking to people and joining groups have provided me with a lot of reassurance and encouragement. It’s helped me to feel less lonely and part of a community, and that’s made all the difference.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/gabis-story-struggle-speaking-about-my-depression-and-loneliness,My struggle with speaking up about my depression,"This content mentions loneliness and depression, which some people may find triggering. Gabi tells us how turning 30 was a bit of a milestone for her. But alongside the celebration and her happy feelings of being loved by so many, her life wasn't matching up to her expectations. While she had a great job, other things like not having a relationship or children started to make her feel lonely and this was affecting her mental health. For me, loneliness isn’t just sitting in an empty room or house with no one to talk to, it was about what was going on inside and how I was feeling and that I didn’t understand what was going on. I had lots of the physical symptoms ofdepression, I just didn’t recognise them. My skin was dry, my hair was falling out and I lost a significant amount of weight. I didn’t understand the constant noise in my head, and just getting up in the morning and functioning took every ounce of my energy. I didn’t understand what was happening and I didn’t tell anyone except my best friend. It felt more lonely because I couldn’t speak about it because things didn’t make sense. Building up the courage to tell people how I was feeling was hard. It’s that feeling of not wanting to admit that you’re not ok, in a world where we’re told to ‘suck it up, everything will be ok.’ The reality for me was that it wasn’t. Once I’d started my therapy and could feel I was making progress, one of the first things I wanted to do was to tell my colleagues at work. I needed to tell them what had happened. I kept things very top-line, but explaining out loud really helped and immediately made me feel less lonely because people knew. And from that moment I began to feel better about myself and found I told another person every week or so. Everyone has been very supportive and no one has treated me any differently. Feeling heard makes things so much better. Of course, it’s much easier to talk once you’re getting better and getting the support you need, but I wish I could have spoken to people earlier when I really needed people the most. I’m not ashamed of what happened and I live with it now. On days when it feels like loneliness is creeping in and I realise I haven’t spoken to people for a while or it feels like things have caught up with me, I can recognise I need help. We spend so much time at work and with our colleagues and I think there’s a huge amount we can do to create workplaces and relationships where conversations can happen. I’m the chair of a mental well-being group at work and want to equip people to be able to have those conversations. In the same way, my peers and colleagues looked out for me, I want to look out for my team in return. I feel so much more in control of my well-being as a result of my therapy and want to share what I’ve learned. If I wake up and feel like it’s going to be a difficult day, then I rewrite my to-do list and set new targets that are realistic. I know what I’ll be able to achieve and what I won’t, and I know that the next day will be better. I want my team to know they can do that too. If you feel affected by the content you have read, please see ourget helppage for support. My name’s Gabi and I’m in my early thirties. A milestone birthday made me feel lonely even though I was surrounded by loved ones. My experience oflonelinessspiralled intodepressionbut looking back on this period, I can see how talking to people helped my recovery. In 2019, I turned 30. I had the most amazing celebrations - I celebrated with lots of family and friends over about five days and at the end of it I remember crying because I felt so loved. I didn’t realise it at the time, but there was something about reaching that milestone and reflecting on what I perhaps imagined my life would have looked like that contributed to me becoming very unwell. I had a good job and a career, but lots of the other things I’d expected just hadn’t materialised. I didn’t own my own home, I wasn’t married or in a relationship and I didn’t have children. It was the tip of the iceberg. I started to become unwell and things began to spiral. Loneliness was an experience where I could be surrounded by all the people that I love, or be in a really exciting meeting at work, but still feel completely disconnected. Things had built up over the years, but by the end of that year, I was extremely unwell and had been referred to the mental health service.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/deans-story-my-mental-health-took-hit-during-pandemic-my-feelings-loneliness-grew,My mental health took a hit during the pandemic,"This content mentions depression, anxiety, loneliness and isolation, which some people may find triggering. Dean tells us how, even though he was surrounded by his loving family and living life to the full, being furloughed during the pandemic, his feelings oflonelinessstarted to grow and his mental health ""took a hit"". I’m Dean and I live with my wife and eldest son near Nottingham. I was furloughed for 18 months during the pandemic from my job at a farm park. Even surrounded by his family, I experienced severe loneliness and felt very low. I live with my wonderful wife and our eldest son. I have a busy, full life. We work at a farm park near to where I live. My wife and I work together on the reception and my son helps to look after the animals. It’s a great place, we’ve made a lot of friends there. When lockdown happened and I was furloughed from work, I felt incredibly lonely, even though I was at home with my family and it didn’t take long for my mental health to take a hit. It’s not just people on their own who get lonely. It’s a massive misconception and something I want to make really clear. At first, when we went into lockdown and were furloughed it was fine. My wife and I have been married for 27 years. We get on well and we communicate, we have a good relationship. Initially, that time was wonderful because there was so much we could do together. But as the pandemic continued, the conversation dried up. We were together all of the time and getting under each other’s feet. Even though we were together I felt lonely and on my own. I started spending time in the garage. I felt extremely low and my mental health really did take a battering. I had a nervous breakdown many years ago, and I’ve suffered fromdepressionandanxietyfor as long as I can remember, but this didn’t feel right at all. I didn’t feel myself. I didn’t feel like I fit in and I didn’t feel part of the world I was in. The days were long and the days were boring. Everything felt like a huge effort and I felt as though I just wanted to go outside and shout and scream at the world. It was a horrible feeling. And because of the lockdown, we were trapped. I couldn’t go out anywhere, I couldn’t just pop to the shops. In the past when I’ve felt lonely, I’ve gone for a walk or done something to get myself out. But this time I was a prisoner and couldn’t do anything or go anywhere. It was a lot worse. Feeling lonely also made me feel incredibly guilty and sad. My wife has been an absolute rock throughout our marriage, she is everything to me, totally brilliant and with me every step of the way. But there I was, feeling not part of her anymore. I felt so lonely even though she was just next door. That feeling really did play with my mind and upset me and made things feel ten times worse. I wish I hadn’t felt that way about my wife who I love so much. It really hurts and saddens me. Sometimes I feel as though I’m not in control of my mind and it’s frightening. I was in a rut I didn’t know how to get out of. I bought myself an exercise bike and a radio which I set up in the garage. I went out there every morning, seven days a week for 30 minutes. I pounded that bike. I made myself sweat and shattered myself and it really did help. I woke up every day and knew what I was going to do - my mind was made up and it really helped. I lost nearly 3 stone, that’s how hard I worked. I’ve never really exercised before, but I’ve still got the bike now and I still use it today.Exercise has helped in so many ways, it was a good thing to come out of that period of loneliness for me. In the past, if someone had told me to give exercise a try - especially to help my mental health - I’d have walked off and thought to myself, ‘what an idiot’. But now I realise how beneficial exercise is not just for your body, but for your mind. I want to sing it from the treetops. I want to tell people to exercise and just to do something to occupy their minds. Keeping my mind occupied has worked wonders for me. Top of my list for anyone feeling lonely is to exercise! But loneliness can take lots of different forms and you’ve got to work at it. If you let it, loneliness can fester into more serious problems. Do something, try to get out. Have a walk in your local park or by a brook or river. Be near nature, be among trees and flowing water. It really does help to settle your mind and to take your mind off the things that are bothering you or dragging you down. From my past experience, I know that when you’re lonely and you don’t feel like doing anything it’s easy to think, ‘well, this is it, this is how I’ll feel for the rest of my life’, but you’ve really got to make the effort and take that big step forward. It’s hard, I know, but I promise you that when you do take that step you will really appreciate it and you really will feel a lot better once you’ve made that effort. It makes a big difference.

Talia first experiencedlonelinesswhen she moved away from her family to study at university. She talks about her feelings and how they got worse during the pandemic lockdowns. She found a lot of support when she began working for Single Parents Wellbeing and this helped her to share her experiences with other people who had similar experiences. I’m Talia, I’m 24 and I live in Cardiff with my daughter. My first experience of loneliness was when I moved away from my family to university. I experienced a second period of loneliness during the pandemic, this affected my mental health and I began to battleanxiety. For the first three years of my daughter's life, we were surrounded by family. People say ‘it takes a village’ and I was lucky enough to have that. It was wonderful. I underestimated the impact of moving away from home when I started university. I’d been in the same place for 18 years and suddenly all of those friendships and family were far away. I assumed it’d be easy to make friends, but the nature of my course meant I only had five contact hours a week. I’d arrive, take notes and then the lecture would be over and everyone disappeared. I lived on the other side of the city and my situation was different to the other students and that initially made it harder to form friendships too. I was really lonely and craved places where I could feel myself and among family. I found a new church and met two girls there who made a massive difference. They invited me for lunch one day and I think they saw that I was lonely. After that, they often invited me and Lily around for dinner. They were just amazing people. They had a motto ‘enough in the pot for ourselves, plus extra’, so they’d always cook enough food so they could share. They welcomed and accepted me. They changed my life and helped me to feel less lonely. I also experienced loneliness during the pandemic. I’d finished uni and Lily was 7. I’d been working in schools but always only for a few days at a time, so it was difficult to form friendships through work. Then overnight I lost my job because the schools were closed, and I was trying to home-school too. It was difficult. I started to experienceanxietyand it was terrifying. I didn’t know what was happening. I wish I’d been better at communicating what I needed. My family wanted to help but they didn’t understand what I was going through. At that time I needed reassurance and support every day because my experience was 24/7. They didn’t realise that I needed daily contact. I internalised that a bit and thought ‘well they should know, I shouldn’t have to ask,’ but that’s not a helpful way to think. If you’re honest about what you need and how you feel people will be there for you. The first six to nine months of the pandemic were the loneliest and hardest. Partly because it was all new - I didn’t know what was happening and couldn’t recognise the anxiety, but also because I was ashamed. I was embarrassed about how I felt and embarrassed to keep talking about it. I felt I was having the same conversation again and again so I stopped talking to people. That made me feel more lonely and isolated. I needed reassurance that things were going to be alright and that I would feel better. And I needed to hear that day after day. I was in a new relationship and my partner was amazing. He didn’t see my need for reassurance as a weakness, he was wonderful. I saw a job advert forSingle Parents Wellbeing(SPW) and knew instinctively that it was a good thing. My anxiety was still quite bad and I didn’t want to be totally honest about how I felt because it was a new job, but they really helped me through things. By connecting with other people who’d had similar experiences, I could better understand how I was feeling and felt less lonely. SPW is a social enterprise that empowers single parents, everything they do is peer-led and they really tap into the power of their network as single parents are amazing! It’s run by compassionate people, and most of the team are single parents themselves, and that compassion is for everyone - staff included. They've recently developed a mental health in the workplace policy that has compassion and community at the heart of it. It made a real difference to be surrounded by people who understood me and cared about me, my family and my mental health. After I joined SPW, I completed one of their well-being programmes. The six-week course is available to single parents and covers mental health, self-confidence and positivity. It was exactly what I needed and helped me to heal and recover from the anxieties I was facing at the time. The pandemic was tough for us all. I'm so proud of myself and of Lily for what we’ve achieved. I have known loneliness and I know how that lack of connection can damage your mental health, but I also know that those moments pass. Working at SPW has changed my life. It’s been like finding another family and that’s what I needed. I’m excited about the future and I’m excited about the difference I’ll be able to make for other single parents and young people as part of the team.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/rhyanas-story-my-feelings-loneliness-worsened-while-i-was-studying-working-and-being-full-time-mum,My feelings of loneliness worsened while studying,"This content mentions loneliness and death or bereavement, which some people may find triggering. Rhyana talks about how her feelings oflonelinessgot worse when she was studying at university and working full-time at the same time. Most of her friends didn't have children as she did, so it was hard to find people who understood how she felt. Joining groups helped hugely but also that it takes time. My name’s Rhyana and I work in the charity sector as well as volunteering with young people. I also host a radio show to raise awareness of Black mental health issues. I have felt lonely throughout my life. I’ve felt lonely at many points in my life. Even when I’ve been around people. Loneliness is different to isolation - that’s important to understand. For me, loneliness feels like being in a bubble around people - like there’s something in between us - and even when the bubble bursts I’m still unable to connect or be myself. The peak of my loneliness was when I was at university. I was working full-time, studying full-time and was a mum - also full-time! At the time, most of my friends didn’t have children and so they just didn’t understand my situation. They were partying and enjoying early adulthood. It was difficult to find anyone who understood what I was going through. My son was a huge motivation and I felt connected to him. I was only 17 when he was born and again, I didn’t really know anyone else in a similar position. My friends would visit but it felt almost performative, they came to see me and the baby and then they were off living their lives. I didn’t have the same opportunity to be out and social, and it wasn’t my priority. I’m part of a big family - I’m the youngest of six siblings. Even in the midst of big family gatherings, I can sometimes feel lonely. And it’s possible to feel lonely and yet still want some space and time to me to be alone. When I feel lonely it feels like I am unseen and unheard. It’s easy to feel small and insignificant and I can’t express how I feel. Even when things are positive, in the past I was unable to express myself - it was like a default up until recently. I can see now that a lot of this started when I realised I was different to my friends. I lost my mum as a baby and as a little girl, I remember that Mother’s Day would come and go and I wouldn’t have the same experience as everyone else. I didn’t understand, though I knew things were different for me and so I’d stay away. And that’s what I learned as an adult. To stay away and not burden people. Sometimes I’ve chosen to be alone and found sanctuary in my solitude. It’s taken a long time to work through things. But I am in a better place, I’ve grown new social circles and built my social capital. I was very intentional with the groups I joined and the connections I made. As ayoung mum, I joined a programme called The Young People’s Project and they had programmes for other young people with children and it was fantastic. I made real lasting friendships. My son is 15 now and they are real friends - they shaped my growth and journey into motherhood. We shared mutual experiences and an understanding and relatability with each other. Relationships and communities like these helped me to find my voice and that’s why I became an advocate. I’m able to share my experiences with people so they can share their experiences in return, opening up needed and necessary conversations. While loneliness has at times felt horrible, the withdrawal I made from other people enabled me to focus on other important things - my motherhood, my education and my career. The experience helped me to feel comfortable with being myself and gave me the confidence to know that it’s ok sometimes not to want to be around other people. I have friendships and networks that I can go to now for advice and guidance and help reduce the feeling of loneliness. Sometimes I still need to withdraw from people for a while, but I feel comfortable enough to tell them this, and they support me by checking in and showing they are there, without pressure for me to respond. This is important for me. I like to choose to be in solitude from time to time, it can be energising and cleansing. It’s a cliche, but be patient with yourself. You can’t rush a process. There are still times when I battle with myself - whether I should go out or not, be around people or not. I’m a very social person and sometimes I feel like I’m letting people down because I don’t want to be out and doing things. That’s ok. There’s a huge expectation for us to be social, but it’s important to recognise when you need your own company. Sometimes you may feel lonely and you may feel isolated. But we are all connected universally. You are part of something bigger and you will find ways to relate to people and to the world. Ask yourself what you want from life. Define what and who you need to help ease your loneliness. Otherwise, relationships and connections can be overwhelming, and they need to be maintained and it’s easy to feel the need to retreat again. Be patient, change will come.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/rhodas-story-my-feelings-loneliness-and-effects-culture-change-after-arriving-uk,Feelings of loneliness and effects of culture change,"This content mentions loneliness and isolation, which some people may find triggering. As anasylum seekerat a young age along with her family, Rhoda talks about her feelings oflonelinessand the effects of culture change when she arrived in the UK. She has support and love from her husband and children and went to university, as well as joined volunteer groups that help other asylum-seekers. I’m Rhoda, I’m 28 and I live with my husband and two young children in Doncaster. I work in customer service and I’m studying Project Management. I’m originally from Nigeria and experienced loneliness and isolation when I arrived in the UK as an asylum seeker in my teens. When I arrived in the UK with my family, integrating into the community was a long, painful and lonely experience and I struggled with my mental health. Finding someone to listen to me, not necessarily to understand, but to hear my story made a huge difference. As an asylum seeker, I felt significant loneliness. When we were in London we lived in a hostel with other asylum seekers, so we had shared experiences and a sense of solidarity. Things got worse when we arrived in Sheffield and began to integrate into the community. It was a reminder of just how different our life was. Mixing with different people who have no comprehension of your experiences can feel very lonely. I went to college and I was the only asylum seeker there. I’m Black and I experienced racism too. I had so much going on in my life. I felt so alone and was struggling so much, including supporting my sister and trying to keep up appointments at the Home Office. When I missed appointments, I’d get a letter saying I would be detained. At that time, I was still a child and the letters made me feel like they were coming to get me. It was so stressful and I was struggling. But I didn’t have time to think about my mental health. You just get on with it. We couldn’t talk to anyone. I felt alone the whole time. I was being bullied but didn’t feel I had anyone to talk to - not even my mother because she had so much going on herself. I was blessed to have Maggie in my life. She was a wonderful woman. She was a support teacher at college and I would go to her every week and talk to her about what was going on. Those conversations helped me a lot because for the first time I felt like I had someone there to support me. There was no way Maggie could understand - but she could listen and support me. Maggie was on my side and fought for me. When I turned 18, I was told I couldn’t continue at college because at the time I didn’t have a status in the country and so my education wouldn’t be funded. I was told to find tuition elsewhere, but Maggie fought for me and then the school gave me a bursary. I heard ‘no’ and ‘you can’t’ a lot. I wanted to be a journalist and teachers told me I couldn’t because I didn’t know English as my first language and because I wasn’t born here. I wanted to go to University but I couldn’t because there was no scholarship. I saw the friends I’d made move away and on to uni and towards their futures, while I had to stay at home. As an asylum seeker, I wasn’t allowed to work. We were living on vouchers and using a food bank. But throughout it all, I volunteered. I volunteered at food banks and refugee centres. Keeping busy really helped me. And when I got my papers, I started working straight away. I’m not someone who thinks about what other people have. I have always been satisfied with what I have and who I am, and that helps me to keep my cool. I’m not alone, I just feel a bit lonely sometimes. I have people around me and I have family around me. I trust God and that works for me. When I feel lonely I either pray or think about my future. It’s not helpful for me to think of the past, so I think about my future and what I want from my future and my worth through what I need to make it happen. I read whatever I need to read, I watch whatever I need to watch and I calculate whatever I need to calculate. I am proud of what I have achieved - I did go to university, I have a wonderful husband and children and I continue to volunteer to help other refugees and asylum seekers. If people feel lonely they should speak to someone. Find someone you trust and tell them how you feel. That person may not understand, but they will listen. And from my experience, when you feel lonely sometimes you just want someone to listen back. You don’t need lots back - I didn’t always need advice - I just needed someone to listen as I talked things through and found solutions myself.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/rachels-story-loneliness-living-single-mum,Rachel's story: the loneliness of living as a single mum,"This content mentions loneliness and depression, which some people may find triggering. Rachel talks about relationship breakdown and thelonelinessof living as a single mum. She talks about the isolation she felt and the lack of physical contact, as well as the company of other adults. She says ""To anyone suffering from loneliness, I’d say talk."" Along with her friend Amy Holland, she set up a new resource for other mothers like Amy and her, organising outdoor meetups as well as a safe space to talk and share. My name is Rachel. I live in Cardiff in Wales with my son Joseph, 11. I co-founded Single Parents Wellbeing, a social enterprise that empowers singleparents, after experiencing extreme loneliness after separating from my husband. I spend lots of time outside. I love going for walks or to the park with Joseph and just getting outdoors. I love to be with other people and to see other parents, and children playing together. We run loads of outdoor events and meet-ups atSingle Parents Wellbeing(SPW) and it’s amazing. Being with other people makes me happy. But it wasn’t always like this. I was heartbroken when my husband and I split up. My son was 2 and at the park, we’d be surrounded by ‘conventional families’, 2.4 kids. Being a single parent is a very lonely job. My friends were busy with their own families. They weren’t around to see us on weekends or bank holidays. Easter and Christmas are the worst for single parents, and I felt like the loneliest single parent on the planet. There was little opportunity for connection with other adults. Back in 2013, I decided to do something about it. I put an advert online and started meeting up with people. I met Amy Holland, my co-founder and we started to organise outdoor meetups. We did it for ourselves, but also for every other single parent in Wales. In 2016, we started receiving regular funding and the group went from strength to strength. By surrounding myself with other people who knew loneliness, and knowing I was doing something to help other people, I started to feel less lonely. We created a new family for ourselves. We’re a social enterprise, but really we’re a big family for single parents. It’s turned my life around. The pandemic really set me back and I felt lonely and isolated again. I love being with people and being sociable and all of a sudden we couldn’t leave the house. My son and I had to isolate ourselves for ten days and it was tough. Home-schooling was hard as well. It was a difficult time for everyone. But as a single parent with no adult company, it was particularly hard. Anyone who knows me will tell you that I love hugs! I had lots of hugs from Joseph, but I really needed a hug from an adult. I missed that physical contact. The pandemic meant we couldn’t see people, and then when we could see people we couldn’t touch them. It was difficult. When I feel I’m struggling there are things I can do to help. Talking with people on FaceTime makes me feel better, and I like to make my room really cosy. I create a nice ambience with lighting and my diffuser which makes the room smell of lavender. It helps me to feel safe. Getting back outside, being in the fresh air and seeing other people made a huge difference too. Know what works for you. Throughout the pandemic, we ran our sessions online. Our online forum kept me going and it helped me to know that other people were in a similar position. I also got some counselling and that helped. I’m proactive in looking after myself and know what works. SPW is a compassionate organisation. We’re committed to the single parents we support but we also care about the health and well-being of everyone who works for us. It’s essential that we’re honest with how we’re feeling and that everyone feels safe and supported to share what’s going on. It’s good to be open and to talk. When you share, you discover other people have similar feelings and straight away that makes you feel less alone. We support one another and that’s massive. To anyone suffering from loneliness, I’d say talk. Talking and being with people is powerful. If you’re thinking about joining a group or asking for help it can feel overwhelming, but you’ll feel better afterwards. Loneliness can lead todepressionbut you will come through it. You will overcome this, you will get better. If you feel like you’re not going to get better, I promise that you will. You will survive this and everything will be ok. SPW is something special that came from a lonely place. Every day I see the difference we’re making. We’re empowering single parents to do incredible things, to believe in themselves and to break the stereotypes that exist. We’re helping them to feel less lonely.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/mehnazs-story-how-my-ms-diagnosis-affects-my-feelings-loneliness,MS affects my feeling of loneliness,"This content mentions loneliness or isolation, which some people may find triggering. Mehnaz is 26 years old and lives with her parents in Birmingham. She is a student nearing the end of her degree after her studies were interrupted by ill health leading to her completing a 3-year degree in 9 years. Seven years ago she was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis, as a result of which she tires quickly when walking, and has memory and concentration issues, as well as various other MS-related symptoms. Her diagnosis is a major factor in her loneliness. However,lonelinesshas been part of her life since leaving sixth form college. That led to me isolating myself from everyone, literally everyone in my life. I think my loneliness started after I had left college. Going from school to college, I was kind of still in the same group of friends. University was a big, massive step because it was like, now I'm in an institution where I don’t know anyone. I think with university you meet people from all walks of life. And because they're not all from the same city as I am they're kind of different. And I'm not used to that differentness. While she has made friends, she hasn’t felt able to build real connections I was speaking to people and making friends, but it was making friends just for the sake of it, just so that I have someone to sit next to. Not […] because I really connected with them. When she is around people at university her loneliness can feel worse: To my left and to my right there are people and they're with their friends. And I can hear them having a good time together, but I've never had that at university. [...] When I see other people really connecting, and then, I'm like, ‘oh, I don’t really connect with anyone’. Since her diagnosis, she has felt even more separate because she keeps her condition secret. She believes people will reject her if they see her as disabled. I did realise very shortly after I was diagnosed that actually what I have is seen as a disability. And then, I don’t know why, but in my head, I was like, ‘no one likes disabled people’, and ‘no one would want to be friends with a disabled person’, even if this is not true. One of the very few people who she has felt genuinely connected to in recent years was one of her lecturers to whom she talked about her diagnosis. For Mehnaz, feeling lonely can bring up a range of difficult emotions that can be hard to escape I feel disappointed in myself, like, ‘seriously, did I really not make any effort to connect with people and stay friends with people after they’ve graduated? I don’t want to be stuck in that cycle […] because once you are completely down below, it’s going to be very difficult to get up. She finds that feeling lonely can take the joy out of life and make it harder to build relationships. While Mehnaz speaks to people, it doesn’t feel natural and so it does not feel fulfilling. I think I do put the effort in. Like, when I'm speaking to someone, I'm pretending to actually really like what they're doing, and I pretend to be really interested in what they're interested in. even if in reality, this is actually not true She knows she has very high expectations of her friends but feels she needs to find the right person for the friendship to be meaningful: I think it’s the fact that I'm putting a lot of expectations into what I want my long-lasting friends to be like. I do think I'm looking too high. But then if I lower, in a sense, my standards, then it’s not really going to... I won't be fully fulfilled. Mehnaz has joined peer support groups for MS on Facebook but has found this is not always helpful as people often focus on negative aspects of the condition. What Mehnaz really wants is to have friends she can openly share with, as she did with her lecturer: I wish I had a group of people […] that I could tell anything to and know in my head that they're not going to judge me’. and this is not going to affect us talking or us being friends anymore.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/kindness/why-did-we-pick-kindness-theme,Why did we pick kindness as the theme?,"Last week, I waited in a socially distanced queue outside the supermarket as the rain started to fall. One of the staff noticed we were getting wet. He scurried away to find a pile of umbrellas, carefully disinfected the handles and passed them out with a smile. To my surprise, my eyes started to well up. At a time when I felt alone, I suddenly felt connected. If I asked you the last time you gave or experienced kindness, you would tell me stories of when you felt moved, protected, held, seen, and loved. Next month we will kick offMental Health Awareness Week (18 to 24 May 2020), focusing on the power and potential of kindness. We think it could be the most important week we’ve hosted, not least becauseour own research showsthat protecting our mental health is going to be central to us coping with and recovering from the coronavirus pandemic - with the psychological and social impacts likely to outlast the physical symptoms of the virus. We have chosen kindness because of its singular ability to unlock our shared humanity. Kindness strengthens relationships, develops community and deepens solidarity. It is a cornerstone of our individual and collective mental health. Wisdom from every culture across history recognises that kindness is something that all human beings need to experience and practise to be fully alive. Find out more about kindness and mental health, and read a few stories from some of our lovely supporters about the acts of kindness they experienced or shared with others during the campaign. But we also want to highlight how kindness is already flowering at this time. We have seen it in the dancing eyes of 100-year-oldCaptain Tom Mooreas he walked his garden to raise money for the NHS and in the mutual aid groups responding to local needs. We want that kindness to spread further in every community in the UK. Finally, we want to use the week to explore the sort of society we would like to emerge from the coronavirus pandemic. Kindness is defined by doing something towards yourself and others, motivated by a genuine desire to make a positive difference. We know from the research thatkindness and our mental health are deeply connected. The research shows that kindness is an antidote to isolation and creates a sense of belonging. It helps reduce stress, brings a fresh perspective and deepens friendships. Kindness to ourselves can prevent shame from corroding our sense of identity and help boost our self-esteem. Kindness can even improve feelings of confidence and optimism. But kindness is an intrinsically risky endeavour. It can risk us looking foolish or being taken advantage of, which is why we sometimes retreat. To receive or to give kindness is an act of courage. We want to use Mental Health Awareness Week to support each other to take that brave step and harness the benefits for both giver and receiver. We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity not only during but also following this pandemic for a reset and re-think about what kind of society we want to emerge from this crisis. Our own reportsand others, such as Sir Michael Marmot’s10 Years Onreport, reveal how inequality is rising in our society and its harmful effects on our health. Life expectancy is falling for the poorest for the first time in 100 years. As child poverty rises, children and young people in the poorest parts of our country aretwo to three timesmore likely to experience poor mental health than those in the richest. After the 2008 credit crunch, the most vulnerable in our communities experienced the severest consequences of austerity, with devastating effects on their mental and physical health. This is not the hallmark of a kind society. Applied kindness could have a transformative impact on our schools, places of work, communities and families. As the former Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has said, now is a time to put values above valuations. We must seize this time to shape a society that tips the balance in favour of good mental health for all of us, especially for those most vulnerable. During Mental Health Awareness Week in May, we will release new data to reveal how many of us experience kindness in the UK and summarise the latest evidence about its important mental health benefits. There are tips, fundraising ideas and stories that we hope will inspire you. We know that one act of kindness can lead to many more. In this type of community action, we need to inspire others as we discover our connection to each other and extend kindness to ourselves. No act of kindness is ever wasted.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/kindness,Kindness and mental health,"In 2020, we found that 63% of UK adults agree that when other people are kind it has a positive impact on their mental health, and the same proportion agree that being kind to others has a positive impact on their mental health. Kindness is defined by doing something towards yourself and others, motivated by genuine desire to make a positive difference. We know from the research thatkindness and our mental health are deeply connected. The research shows that kindness is an antidote to isolation and creates a sense of belonging. It helps reduce stress, brings a fresh perspective and deepens friendships. Kindness to ourselves can prevent shame from corroding our sense of identity and help boost our self-esteem. Kindness can even improve feelings of confidence and optimism. Below are a few stories from some of our lovely supporters on the acts of kindness they experienced or shared with others during the campaign. You can also watch our short video where our supporters share why kindness matters and what kindness means to them. 9th Oct 2025

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/how-look-after-your-mental-health-later-life,How to look after your mental health in later life,"This content mentions death or bereavement, anxiety and depression, which some people may find triggering. This guide provides you with tips on how to look after your mental health in later life. Some people think that mental health problems are simply part of getting older. This isn’t true and doesn’t have to be the case. We have produced this booklet for people in their 60s who are approaching retirement or who have recently retired from work. During this big change, it’s important to take care of ourselves mentally as well as physically. We can protect our mental health, and this booklet suggests 10 practical ways to do this. You can read the guide below,download it as a PDForbuy printed copies in our online shop. Our mental health is about how we think and feel: our outlook on life and how we are able to cope with life’s ups and downs. It’s an essential part of our health. One in four people in the UK will experience a mental health problem in any given year. Most of us go through times when we feel down, but research suggests that those in later life are more at risk of experiencing the effects of poor mental health. The transition into later life and thelife eventsduring this period can triggeranxietyordepression– the death of a loved one, starting retirement,loneliness, financial difficulties, or ongoing health issues are a few examples. One in five older people living in the community and two in five people living in care homes experience depression or poor mental health. Research shows that there are five key issues that can have an impact on the mental wellbeing of older people: Even though there are laws in place to help with some of these issues – for instance, the Equality Act 2010 addresses age discrimination – you may feel that you can’t influence society-wide problems like pensioner poverty. However, as an individual, there is a lot you can do to protect your own mental wellbeing. Throughout this booklet, you can find references for where to get both help and advice. Read on for 10 practical ways to help you stay mentally well. Getting older and retirement both involve a change in lifestyle for most people. There is no longer a compulsory retirement age, with the default age of 65 having been phased out. It is important to note that retirement age is not the same as state pension age, which can range between 61 and 68 depending on gender and date of birth. The age of retirement is decided by the employee, because not everyone feels ready to retire at the same time. If you want, or need, to keep working, discuss this with your employer. Or, you may see this as an opportunity to work part time, change to flexible working hours, or find a new job. The law is evolving in this area, so follow the links in the ‘Employment’ section ofGov.ukfor current information. If you think you have experienced age discrimination, organisations such asAge UKandAcascan offer information, advice and help. Being retired doesn’t mean you aren’t still busy. Being retired (or semi-retired) can be a busy life. Friends and family can have plans for your time, filling it with anything from childcare to DIY tasks. It is important to make time for your own interests. This can be a chance to try a new activity or learn new skills. If your work or career is a major part of your life, consider how to deal with the changes to: If you haven’t had many interests outside of work it can be hard to ‘find something new to do’ and it may take a few attempts before you find something that’s right for you. Take your time and think about the skills you possess that can be put to good use and give you fulfilment – perhaps try helping out with a local community organisation or doing conservation work. Social interaction is important for maintaining your wellbeing. If you are used to sharing life’s ups and downs with others at work, keep up friendships once you retire. Others who are your age are great sounding boards for dealing with the challenges of retirement and can understand the transition into retirement. You should also look to develop new friendships with people of all ages. Friendships with both older and younger people help to keep you in touch with the world as it changes. Some people do develop mental health problems or conditions, such as depression,dementiaor memory loss, as they get older, but it isn’t an inevitable part of old age. However, if you think you are developing a mental health problem or condition, don’t worry and just take action, as there are treatments available. If you are worried about your memory, or dementia,speak to your GPor visitDementia UKfor more information. You might think that pursuing new learning and work is just for young people, but volunteering, career changes and returning to education are becoming more popular with people over 50. Many organisations depend on the skills and experience that older people possess. Don’t dismiss volunteering as for ‘do-gooders’: many people can tell you it’s an essential part of getting work experience. Volunteering can even be good for your health. Managing problems, difficulties and worries becomes easier if we talk about our concerns. It’s a good way to rationalise our thoughts and make sense of a situation or of how we feel. It can make us feel supported and not alone. Talking about problems and concerns doesn’t mean you have to discuss your emotions, or lay yourself completely bare about how you’re feeling. Some people may find this helpful, while others prefer to keep conversations on a practical level. Talking about how you feel, or your emotions, isn’t a sign of weakness: it’s about taking charge of your wellbeing. Who you want to talk with depends on what’s worrying you. You could try: Having a chat is never a one-way street. Sharing your thoughts can help others find the courage to talk about their problems. If you don’t want to talk about yourself, ask others how they feel. Hearing that others have similar worries and thoughts can make it easier to discuss something that’s bothering you. Being able to talk with others should be an everyday event. Don’t put off having a chat, and avoid building it up to be a big event, like ‘we must talk about the wills’, as this can make it daunting for you and the other person. An ongoing conversation over days or weeks allows everyone time to think and give considered input. ‘Conversations don’t have to be all about life’s difficulties. Tell each other about the enjoyable events too!' Who do we ask or where do we go when we need help or advice? Support from friends and family is invaluable. However, they may lack the specialist knowledge you need despite their best intentions. Whether you need help fixing a leaky gutter or with managing limited finances, the following organisations can either help you directly or point you in the right direction. Admitting that times are emotionally tough isn’t easy. Asking for help can be harder. Difficult feelings can stop you from getting on with life. Feeling down or anxious for prolonged periods doesn’t just impact on you, but can also affect those around you; for instance, if your mood or reactions are unpredictable. As well as advice from official sources, such as those given above, Internet forums, chatrooms and networking sites can allow you to share your own experiences with others facing the same issues. Age UKand some local councils offer training courses in using email and the Internet. ‘Your GP can help in practical ways, as well as offering a listening ear; for instance, they can recommend exercise therapy, counselling, help from a specialist, or support from another part of the health service.’ Allowing an issue to become a constant worry can be bad for our mental wellbeing. Having a plan to deal with it puts us back in charge and can help improve how we feel. These are some things that can cause worry as you get older: It is also important to plan for pleasurable things, such as spending time with family, developing new hobbies, and enjoying your leisure time. If you don’t have a plan for your time, you may find that others plan it for you. A plan can help you think through all the aspects of a problem or situation. By preparing a plan, you are likely to expose and deal with many of your worries in advance. You may need to do some research, like finding out about the state pension, National Insurance top ups, pension credits, and buying an annuity. Gov.ukis a good place to start when fact-finding. Your plan should have a clear aim, such as staying active. A regular review of your plan helps to make sure you are still on track. Include in your plan the sort of feelings you could experience and how you could deal with them. Discussing wills or care needs with loved ones may be emotional – how will you react? How you use a plan is up to you – it’s for your benefit. Consider whether you want to write it down or not. This may depend on whether you want to share it with others. By having a plan, you always have something to refer back to and to use when you face a problem. Of course, not everything can be planned for, and plans need to change as situations alter; for example, a change to the benefit system may affect your financial planning. Review and amend your plans as you need to. As we get older, we may find ourselves looking after grandchildren, elderly parents, partners, friends, or neighbours. Caring for others can keep relationships strong and people close. Helping others makes us feel needed and valued, as well as boosting our self-esteem. These things are good for our mental wellbeing. Care could be looking after your grandchildren during school holidays, or the long-term and full-time care of your partner or elderly parents. Being a carer isn’t always easy. Many find it demanding both physically and emotionally. Looking after a loved one whose mental and/or physical health is deteriorating can present extra challenges for carers. If this issue affects you,contact your GP,Age UK, or your local social services. There is help and support widely available. Caring for others can be rewarding, such as seeing your grandchildren taking their first steps or sharing a laugh with a neighbour. However, there can be stresses and strains along the way. Try not to overburden yourself with care responsibilities. Hard though it seems, it is alright to say ‘no’. Making time for yourself is good both for you and for the person you care for. If you feel under pressure to keep saying ‘yes’, then contactCarers UK, Counsel and Care, or Crossroads Care for advice or help with respite care to enable you to recharge your batteries. A local carers’ support group may help to make you feel less isolated with your responsibilities. Talking with other carers helps to release frustrations, as they understand the pressures that caring can bring. There can also be opportunities to share resources, skills and knowledge so that everyone (other carers and the people you care for) benefits. The organisations mentioned above can help, and your GP or local council may know of local groups, services and facilities. If you are interested in helping care for others locally, then the organisations listed above would be glad to hear from you. Voluntary schemes offer a range of help to people in the community; for instance, WRVS provides meals on wheels. To offer your help, visitDo-it.org.ukfor more information. Friends can keep you on track when life is difficult. They can offer a different view on a problem as well as practical help, or can be a sounding board for your thoughts. Friendship takes time, and sometimes effort. It is easy to lose touch with people, especially if their life seems too busy for you or if you are feeling down. Having friends is a positive way to maintain good emotional health, even when doing so may sometimes seem like hard work. Don’t lose touch with the people who are important to you – it’s never too late to get back in touch with old friends. You may have friends and family scattered around the country or world. Explore keeping in touch by phone, email, webcam, Skype, Facebook, or letter. The world is constantly changing, and you are not alone if you feel out of step with it. Technology has had a big impact on the way we communicate. You may feel that the values and attitudes you have are no longer respected. But not everyone from the younger generation lives up to their media reputation. Keeping in touch with people from other generations can help to keep this in perspective and can make you realise that there are like-minded people of all ages. Consider volunteering with youth work, chatting more with friends’ grandchildren, or helping out at a local school. Having friends of your own generation is important, too. They can better understand life from your perspective. Plus, it’s good to reminisce sometimes about old TV favourites or the types of cars you used to own. If you’re used to a close circle of friends at work, will you keep in touch when you retire? You may find that work friends were great when you shared common problems, but that the friendship changes when you no longer work together. Don’t shy away from making new friends – perhaps through a new shared interest, such as walking, travelling or reading. Friendships do change with time. Sometimes it is difficult to give the time we want to every friendship. Friendships can go sour for many reasons. If a friendship starts to hurt you, mentally or physically, then don’t be afraid to take a break from it, or end it. Keeping in touch with friends is also about considering what is good for them. Don’t be offended if your children can’t talk when you phone at 6.30pm as they sit down for a family meal or are starting to help with their own children’s homework. Likewise, calling people when they are at work won’t always get the best result; try meeting them for lunch instead. Similarly, if you don’t want to be called after 9.00pm because it’s time to get ready for bed, let your loved ones know! Staying active and sleeping well are proven ways to look after our wellbeing. Regular physical activity and exercise can: Being active doesn’t necessarily mean going to the gym; t’ai chi, Pilates, gardening, dog walking, dancing, or being part of a walking group are all good ways to get some exercise. Being active doesn’t have to cost much money. Many councils offer activities at lower rates for older people. Our publication ‘How to look after your mental health using exercise’ suggests ways that you can get active and stay active. Physical activity can be as effective as anti-depressant medication in treating mild to moderate depression, which is why exercise therapy is available on prescription in many areas. Information is available fromNHS, or your GP may be able to help. Getting a good night’s sleep allows your body and mind to rest, repair and re-energise. Not sleeping well can cause a range of problems, including: In the longer term, trouble sleeping can lead to mental health problems such as anxiety, stress and depression. Sleep patterns can change with age and may be influenced by: Good sleep doesn’t just mean lots of sleep, as the amount of sleep that each person needs is different. Our publication ‘How to sleep better’ suggests ways that you can improve your sleep. You can also talk to your GP about sleep problems, as they may be able to change your medication or suggest solutions to other health issues that may be keeping you awake. Keeping your mind active is important, too. There are many ways of doing this, such as: What we eat and drink affects how we feel. Sometimes there’s an immediate effect, for instance with alcohol. Other things we consume can have long-term impacts. The human body and mind needs a mix of nutrients to work properly. Eating at least five portions of fruit and vegetables each day is recommended, and is a vital part of a healthy diet. Stopping your body from dehydrating is important, whatever the weather. You may want to consider limiting your intake of sugary drinks, caffeine, and alcohol as, in excess, they can have a negative effect on your wellbeing. The odd alcoholic drink is unlikely to harm you if you drink them in moderation and if alcohol doesn’t conflict with any medication you are taking. Stay within the recommended daily alcohol units. Popping to the pub or club for a drink can be a good social experience, but solitary habitual drinking is often a sign of a problem. Drinking alcohol is not a good way to manage difficult feelings. Visitdrinkawarefor more information and advice. Sharing food or a drink is an enjoyable social event. Make it a reason to meet up with friends, even if it’s just for a cuppa in the local café. Eating properly when coping with bereavement can be difficult, especially if you are not used to cooking for one or preparing meals at all. During this time, your appetite may be affected by your emotions. Try not to eat alone all the time. Take up offers from friends and family to eat with them. Find out if there are any lunchtime clubs that operate in your area, perhaps as part of a reading group or other interest groups. Alcohol and mental healthare closely linked - find out more about how it affects your brain, your body, your mental health and how to get help if you're worried about your drinking. Doing things that we enjoy makes us feel good about ourselves and about life; plus, it can keep our mind and body active. Whatever we call them, interests, hobbies and pastimes can provide a chance to socialise, or to find time for ourselves. Some people enjoy their work so much that they don’t want to retire. Explore the options with your employer. As there is no longer a default retirement age, there are a number of options available to explore. If work has taken up most of your life, it may be time to look around for a new interest to immerse yourself in. Meaningful activity is vital for good emotional health, so try to start new activities before you retire. Don’t be scared to try a few things before settling on the ones that you enjoy. You may have skills to share with others. Look at local volunteering options, or join a specialist interest group. Time Bank is a skill-share scheme where you benefit from other people’s skills in exchange for your own. Or you may want to learn new skills or develop an old one. Local councils and universities run a range of education and learning opportunities, often at lower rates for older people. ‘Sometimes when I’m sitting on the bus, I let my thoughts flow and it really helps me.’ Pets make wonderful companions and can bring social benefits, too. Walking the dog gives you daily exercise, is a reason to go out, and is a way of meeting people. House rabbits love to play, and cats crave a warm lap to curl up on. Your local vet or theRSPCAcan advise about the best type of pet for you. Always make time for your own hobbies and interests. If you are a busy carer, you must still find time for your own interests in order to look after your own wellbeing. While being retired or semi-retired may appear to others to be a permanent holiday, the reality is different. There are still jobs that need doing, like cleaning, car repairs, financial paperwork, and shopping. Plus, we may have new responsibilities as a carer. Creating a routine for your day or week can give life a structure or rhythm. However, a break from this refreshes the mental batteries. Plan free time in your weekly routines for things you enjoy, whether it’s time in the park or in the art gallery. A break needn’t be long: just time for what you enjoy and for letting your mind recharge. Look at how you spend 51 your time. Can you find half an hour each day to pick up a book or sit with a crossword? What about every week? Is there time for an afternoon out? It’s whatever relaxes you and helps you take a break. Having a break need not cost a fortune. There are many bargains to be had – sometimes for booking well in advance, others for those who book last-minute. Some travel companies offer special rates for older people. Does your council offer free or discounted public transport for over 65s? Are there lower rates or free entrance to local attractions? You may find it hard to relax if you feel under pressure to be doing something else. This can be because you feel guilty about not caring for others, or because you aren’t used to having time to spend on yourself. Relaxing doesn’t have to be about sitting down or physically relaxing. It’s about doing something you enjoy. Having a hectic life may mean you want time alone when you have a break. Or do you want the company of others to stimulate your mind and make you think of things other than the stresses of life? Having a break can be a chance to meet new people and explore interests. It can be as active or as restful as you want – from a pottery course or learning first aid, to a walking weekend or trying paragliding! These websites allow you to find volunteer opportunities close to where you live: You can also contact an organisation directly – for example,The National Trust,St John AmbulanceorVolunteer Reading Help– to offer your time.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/looking-after-your-mental-health-prison-guide-male-prisoners,Looking after your mental health in prison,"This content discusses substance abuse or addiction (which may include mentions of alcohol or drug use), depression, anxiety and death or bereavement, which some people may find triggering. Being in prison can be a very difficult experience. The environment, the rules and regulations, and lack of personal control can all affect your mental health. In general, prisoners have a higher chance of developing poor mental health. Older prisoners, those with a physical or learning disability, and other vulnerable groups are especially at risk of experiencing poor mental health whilst in prison. “I was in prison in 2011 and it was my first time ever. I remember feeling so scared and I did not know what to think about this very dark place. It felt cold and dreary, nothing like home.” All quotes in this booklet are from prisoners at HMP Parc, Bridgend. You canread the guide below, anddownload it as a PDF. This booklet discusses ways to look after your mental health in a prison setting. “I also had to understand and accept that I was in prison because of my own actions and consequences. The consequence was a prison sentence. Yet, even though I am a prisoner, I can still achieve and make a success of my life.” Mental health is about how you think and feel and your ability to deal with ups and downs. Looking after your mental health in prison can help you: Everyone’s mental health fluctuates. We all have times when we feel down, stressed or frightened. Most of the time, these feelings pass, but sometimes they develop into a more serious problem. Self-harm is a serious problem in prison. Although thestatistics for self-harmare higher for women than men in prison, you can ask for support from the mental health team if self-harm is an issue for you. ""Jail can be scary, the unfamiliar surroundings, the loud noises, a routine that revolves around time….” There are lots of factors that affect our mental health. Two areas that greatly affect your mental health arebereavementandsubstance abuse. Prison staff tell us that they are aware that when a prisoner experiences a bereavement, not enough is done. One of the greatest hardships of prison is missing out on family events and the most difficult can be the death and funeral of a loved one. There are a number of special licences that may be possible for you to access in order to visit a dying relative or attend a funeral. Please ask staff to see if you are able to apply for such a licence. Alternatively, you may be able to attend a funeral or visit a dying relative under escort. This means having a minimum of two officers with you and may include the use of restraints if the risk assessment says that it’s necessary. If you do experience a bereavement, you should be offered pastoral care from the chaplain who can support you during this difficult time. It’s important to request that the chaplain visits you again if that will be helpful. Sharing the news with people you trust is important, whether this means talking to officers, prisoners, Listeners or calling theSamaritans. Try not to bottle up the news, as that is likely to cause more harm than good. If you are struggling after a bereavement you should ask for support. For further information you can contact thePrison Reform Trust. It has been widely documented that there are many drugs circulating in prisons. This represents challenges both if you are someone who has regularly used drugs in the past or someone who hasn’t used drugs before. One way of thinking about this is that you are likely to feel a great deal worse after taking drugs, compared to before. The synthetic marijuana drug, Spice or K2, is extremely addictive and has horrendous side effects such as vomiting and seizures. The status of drugs is complex in the prison system. If you are able to, it is best to say “no” and keep saying “no” to drugs. For further information for you and/or your family and friends the following organisations may be of help: The following tips for looking after your mental health in prison have come from prisoners themselves as well as researchers working in prison. “I have no one. No one sits with me or talks to me on the wing.” When people feel sad ordepressed, they can neglect themselves. Keeping regular hygiene routines such as washing, shaving, and wearing clean clothes is often the first thing to do when we struggle with our mental health. Prisoners tell us that it’s hard to get motivated to care for their appearance when they feel low. Being unkempt and uncared for can affect how other people think of us and lead to an even stronger sense of isolation. Building a regular hygiene routine can help bring consistency to life in a prison environment. Showering and shaving every day are simple goals that make a big difference to our self-esteem. These can go a long way to protecting ourselves from being overwhelmed by poor mental health. The same thing goes for eating a healthy balanceddiet. Choosing what you eat may be one of the few things that you have control over in prison, so make the most of it: A diet that’s good for your physical health is also good for your mental health. If you would like to find out more, ask the prison library or Healthcare if they can print information from the following links: “When I first came to prison I was scared and I didn’t know which way to turn, who I could trust, what I had to do, no one helped me. I felt lost.” Asking for support and help in a new situation is not a sign of weakness. Finding out about routines, rules and what’s available to make life easier in prison is very important for your well-being. It may be surprising that for many prisoners, time in prison is the first opportunity they have had to turn their lives around, improve their health and access the services they need. Talking about personal thoughts and feelings isn’t easy. Prisoners tell us that finding someone they trust to talk to can be difficult. Talking about feelings can be hard, so it may be useful to plan what you want to say in advance. Talk to Health Care, the Chaplain or Wing Staff to support you. “I had a problem and I shared it with these guys last week and we all talked about the different ways of dealing with it. That was really useful.” Talking can be a way to cope with a problem you have been carrying in your head for a while. In many prisons, prisoners have been trained as Listeners and offer a confidential service. Talking to someone experiencing the same situation can help you feel less isolated, and feeling listened to can help you feel more supported. “Now I ain’t saying I am cured and life is great, because it is far from it but I know there is support and if you are feeling low or think what’s the point anymore- don’t suffer in silence. Speak to a listener, Chaplain or support mentor because these people are there whenever you need them. So if it is early hours and you need to talk, remember to press your bell and ask for a listener.” “Keeping yourself busy is key. I feel better when I am busy.” Regular physical activity and exercise can help your physical and mental health. Researchers have found that even moderate exercise in a prison setting positively affects mental health and effectively reduces the risk ofdepression1. You might want to visit the gym and exercise facilities. It doesn’t have to be sports-related exercise, though – it could be gardening or animal husbandry. Anything that gets you moving can make you feel better. If you are slightly older, find out if the prison offers any special ‘Wellman’ programmes to help you manage weight, blood pressure, and any long-term health conditions. Sometimes prisoners have to spend up to 23 hours a day in their cells, so learning individual exercises that can be carried out in limited spaces can be helpful. Set achievable goals such as getting a little fitter or losing weight. Working towards goals (see tip 7) can help you to focus, and achieving them can help to improve your self-esteem. “I am going to the gym and have joined the outdoor walking club. I still set goals in relation to the gym.” There are useful booklets and videos available that tell you more about the benefits of exercise and help you create a simple exercise routine. Ask your prison library if they can access them for you, for exampleHow to look after your mental health using exercise. “Now I am learning to read and write so I can send a letter to my wife in my own handwriting.” The one thing that prisoners have is time. This time can be taken up with worry or feeling angry. It can also provide the opportunity to learn a new skill or develop an interest. Learning can help build confidence and a sense of self-worth. Learning can be good for our well-being, especially when it’s something that you want to do and comes at a stage when you are ready to benefit from it. There may be more opportunities to learn new skills in prison than you might expect. This might be cooking in the kitchen or gardening. Some prisons have peer mentoring schemes so you could become a peer mentor or think about career development. You could also improve your reading or writing and gain some qualifications. Or you could become a listener or mentor. Learning something new or developing a skill can take you away from your current surroundings. This can have a positive impact on your mental health. “Since being in here, I have done my Art GCSE and Art A level. Before I came in here, I couldn’t read or write and so I was so chuffed with the A* at GCSE.” “I am quite a negative person but now I look on the bright side. I am here (in prison) for six years, six months but I am not here as long as others. That is the way I look at it.” In difficult situations, your thoughts are more likely to be negative. This can lead to feelinganxious, guilty or angry. This negative thinking can become habitual, particularly when life is challenging. Over time this can lead to depression or become a barrier to making changes and improvements to our lives. It’s important to challenge negative thoughts to maintain our mental health. Developing a more positive thinking habit takes time but can make a difference to the way you feel and behave. The following can help you to change negative thought patterns to become more positive: Try to identify and understand where the negative thoughts come from. This might be directly from prison, but it is also likely that they result from past experiences. Be aware of when you have negative thoughts and how they impact on you. Try to make a positive decision to make a change to improve. Positive statements can encourage us to cope in difficult circumstances. Try to build up a list of positive phrases that you can use. Here are some ideas from other prisoners: When things get difficult, it’s helpful to focus on the solution and not the problem. Be aware that there are some things you can control and others can’t. Try not to focus too much on things you have no control over. An example one prisoner gave was that rather than getting upset by a lockdown preventing him from going to the gym, he used the time to do a workout in his cell instead. Living Life to the Fullhas lots of really useful worksheets to help you work with these issues. Ask the prison library or Healthcare if they can print some for you to use. “In prison you have a lot of time behind the door...” Research has shown that regular meditation can help reduce stress levels in prisoners2, particularly if stress has been maintained over a long period of time. “Mindfulness is a way of paying attention to the present moment, using techniques like meditation, breathing and yoga. It helps us become more aware of our thoughts and feelings so that, instead of being overwhelmed by them, we’re better able to manage them.”3 Mindfulnessis a simple practice to learn that has also been shown to have positive benefits in combatingstress,anxietyanddepression, as well as physical problems such as high blood pressure and chronic pain. You can practice mindfulness alone or in a group. There are several courses run by trained mindfulness coaches in some prisons now, but books and audio courses are also available. Check your prison library or ask the Health Care team. Here is a one-minute mindfulness breathing exercise you can practice anywhere at any time: Take a minute to observe your breathing. Breathe naturally and notice the time between each breath in and out. When your mind wanders, just gently bring it back to breathing. You can continue for longer than one minute if you want to. If you find mindfulness difficult, you can also use relaxation techniques to reduce stress. These can help to: These physical responses will also help you to feel calmer and less anxious or agitated. You can practice relaxation in a group or alone. Take a look at our useful booklet, “How to look after your mental health using Mindfulness”, which the prison library or Healthcare could download for you. “I now draw pictures for other inmates so that they can send it to their loved ones in their letters, for their kids or for birthdays.” Setting goals may seem impossible in prison, but achieving small things can make a real difference to your well-being. Having a goal to work towards can build your sense of self-worth and confidence. Here are some examples of goals below that prisoners have set. These may depend on what’s available in the prison: Having a clear sense of what you want to achieve can give you a focus in prison. Goal-setting links well with positive thinking and being solution-focused. Start practising with a ‘Quick Win’ goal, which you can achieve within the next week. This will help you understand what motivates you and will also help build your confidence. For example, this could be cleaning your teeth at the same time each day. During this time, think about one or two bigger goals you would like to achieve in the medium and long term. You should try and make theseSMARTgoals: Break these down into smaller ‘step-by-step’ goals. Breaking your bigger goal into smaller achievable steps makes it more manageable and helps you see your progress. If you want, let people know what you hope to achieve and accept their encouragement and support. “Get back to the wife and kids and never look back. I want to be anger free and learn to read.” “I couldn’t believe how hard it was for my family and all I did was worry about them, being away from them made me sink into a dark place. But they are the ones who made me strong” Maintaining contact with friends and loved ones outside of prison can be very difficult. You may feel that they don’t want anything to do with you or that you have let them down, but you (and them) need to keep communication lines open. Maintaining regular contact with people in the outside community can help you survive the day-to-day stress of being in prison. It keeps you in touch with the outside world and can inspire you to work towards a different life in the future. Research recognises that regular contact with family and friends can play an important role in helping prisoners through their sentences, including improving mental well-being for both prisoners and their families.4 Find out about visiting times and visitors' application process as soon as possible. Establishing regular visits can give you something to look forward to. Prisons often set up family visit days to help keep prisoners and their children in touch. Charities such asBarnardo’swork with prisons in the UK to support prisoners’ families to maintain good contact with each other. Remember that your family may find it difficult to get to visit for all sorts of reasons, such as distance and cost of travel. It is important to respect and understand what they might be going through. Find out if your prison offers family support services and do make use of them. It is still possible to have regular visitors even if you have lost contact with your family or have no family and friends that can visit.The National Association of Prison Visitorshas volunteers who will visit regularly. The aim of the association is to extend the hand of friendship and promote the value of friendship. They help prisoners keep a link with the outside and a sense of belonging to a community. Here is a quote from their website: “Having a visitor means a lot. It means that someone from outside is bothered enough about me to come and visit.” “I have no-one. No-one sits with me or talks to me on the wing.” Being ‘inside’ means living closely with many different types of people, such as other prisoners and prison officers. This can be very stressful and intimidating. Even though it’s a crowded and noisy environment with little privacy, it can be very lonely and isolating. Having good relationships can help our physical and mental health. A supporting relationship enhances our well-being and can be a buffer from the negative effects of stress in our lives.5 A positive relationship needs time and attention given to it. If you want someone to be there for you and listen to you, you need to do the same in return. “Now I am friends with Toby and Derek…we can communicate with each other because they have been on the same course. We have formed a mini-membership club because we have some things in common with other people who have been on the course.” Being around positive people can make us happier. Equally, our well-being can be negatively affected by harmful relationships, leaving us unhappy. “I am a highly distressed person so I bottle it up a lot, so it was good to talk in a group. I keep talking to people now.” Here are some features of positive and negative relationships: “It makes me feel better that people recognise me for my artwork” Doing good indeed feels good, but this is actually backed up by research.6 Being a part of a social network leads to a feeling of belonging. Face-to-face activities such as volunteering can help reduceloneliness and isolation. Helping others in need, especially those who are less fortunate than yourself, can provide a real sense of perspective. This can enable you to stop focusing on what you feel you are missing and help you to feel more positive. Being kind can improve confidence, happiness and optimism. It can also contribute to a more positive community. There are also physical benefits, such as; reducing stress and decreasing feelings of anger and hostility, and studies show that helping others can even help us live longer! It may seem hard to think of ways of doing good whilst in prison, so here are some suggestions: “People helped me with what to do and what to say. And by advising me it gave me strength to respond and challenge. This has helped me and people stopped picking on me.” Regular smallacts of kindnesscan positively change your attitude to life. You may also discover a new direction like the prisoner in this quote below: “I want to work with the homeless – I used to run pubs and now I want to run a café for the homeless, where people can drop in and keep warm.” If you feel affected by the content you have read, please see ourget helppage for support.

It can help you manage stress, feel more confident and boost your mood.It can also ease symptoms of mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression. Still, being physically active can be difficult. In fact, up to 45% of adults and 30% of children aren’t meeting the government recommendations for physical activity - and this is understandable.1,2 There are many barriers that can stop you from being physically active. This guide explores the mental health benefits of physical activity and small strategies to help you add physical activity to your daily routine. To help you understand how physical activity benefits your mental health, and how to get the most from it, this page covers: Physical activity means any movement of your body that uses your muscles and uses up energy. Physical activity can be split into three main categories: Physical activity can improve your mental health in multiple ways. Let’s explore some of the main benefits of physical activity for mental health: When you’re physically active, your brain releases feel-good chemicals called endorphins and serotonin. These can naturally improve your mood, reduce tension and stress and make you feel more energised.4 Stress can increase your risk of sleep problems and feelings of overwhelm in the short term, and mental health problems and heart disease long-term.5-7 Physical activity lowers the level of stress hormones (called adrenaline and cortisol) in your body, which makes you feel less stressed. Physical activity can also soothe the physical effects of past stress, such as back pain, headaches, neck pain or stomach problems. This can help your body to relax. How to manage and reduce your stress Self-esteem is how you feel about yourself, including how much you value and believe in yourself. Physical activity can improve how you see yourself and increase your sense of self-worth. It can also give you a more positive outlook, making it easier to live a satisfying life.9-11 Being physically active provides some protection againstdepressionif you haven’t experienced it before and reduces existing depression symptoms. Any form of physical activity can help relieve depression symptoms.12 Physical activity can act as a form ofanxietyrelief, helping to reduce the symptoms of anxiety disorders and the physical influence of anxiety on the body. It does this in the same way it reduces your stress - the release of endorphins and other feel-good chemicals helps your body feel more relaxed and calm.13 There are many barriers that may stop you from getting the physical activity you need. The main ones tend to be: You may face multiple barriers to exercising, and that’s normal. But these barriers don’t have to stop you from living a physically active life. Here are our tips to help make it easier to increase your physical activity. If you were told doing the washing up was good for your physical and mental health, would that make you want to do it? Probably not. The same applies to being physically active. You’re more likely to stay physically active and integrate exercise into your life if you find activities you enjoy doing. When it comes to getting physically active, it’s easy to get ahead of yourself and make promises that you struggle to keep. So, it’s best to take your time and gradually increase how physically active you are. You can start by adding 10 minutes of movement into each day and then adding an extra 10 minutes each week. Before you know it, you’ll be up to 30 minutes of physical activity a day. Becoming more physically active doesn’t have to involve making elaborate changes to your routine. Instead, it could involve making small tweaks to activities you’re already doing. For example, you could use a walking treadmill under your desk if you work from home. Setting goals can help you perform better as it improves focus and motivation and gives you a sense of purpose. However, be careful with the type of goal you set. Research shows that goals concentrating on performance rather than the process itself can be demotivating.14 For example, a goal to “Do a 1-mile run in 12 minutes” is likely to be less effective than “Go for a run three times a week.” Home is a fantastic place for rest, but this can mean it’s one of the places you move the least. Long periods of inactivity can increase your risk of depression, dementia, weight gain, diabetes and other health and mental health conditions.16-19So, moving more at home is important for your health. One of the easiest ways to reduce long periods of inactivity at home is by incorporating physical activity into everyday tasks, such as: For two more tips on how to get physically active, check out our guide. Studies show that working out with other people can help keep you motivated and hold you accountable so you’re less likely to skip a session.15However, when choosing who to buddy up with, try to pick someone who is at a similar fitness level to you. Choosing someone who is much more physically active can be demotivating and disheartening. Printed copies of this publication are available in our online shop.

Research shows that mindfulness can reduce stress, ease symptoms of anxiety and depression, and improve our overall wellbeing. Yet, despite these benefits, mindfulness isn’t always easy to put into practice. Many people are unsure where to start or how to incorporate it into everyday life. That’s why we’ve created a guide to help you understand what mindfulness is, how it works and how you can use it to support your mental health. Download publication To help you better understand mindfulness and put it into practice, this page covers: Mindfulness means paying attention to the present moment, whether that’s through everyday awareness or specific practices. It could be as simple as noticing the smell of our morning coffee, taking a slow walk, or pausing to reflect on our thoughts without judgement. Two core elements define mindfulness: Mindfulness is often linked with meditation, but they’re not the same. Meditation is a structured technique that involves setting time aside to train our minds to focus. Mindfulness means being present in the moment, so it can happen at any time. According to the NHS, studies show that mindfulness can improve our wellbeing in several ways. As such, mindfulness is now widely used with adults to: For children and young people, mindfulness may also improve cognitive skills like memory and planning. Mindfulness works by shifting how we relate to our thoughts, emotions and experiences. Instead of being swept away by them, we learn to notice and manage them with greater awareness. Mindfulness does this in several ways: There are many ways to be more mindful. Here are three ways to incorporate mindfulness throughout the day: You don’t need to try to ease the feeling in this moment, just become aware of it. Once you’ve acknowledged the feeling in each area, move on to the next area of your body. For a full list of seven ways to be more mindful,check out our Mindfulness Guide You can get support with mindfulness through a group course or a one-to-one with a trained mindfulness coach. There are online courses, books and audio, too, where you can learn through self-directed practice at home. If you’re unsure where to start or want to try a structured approach, the following organisations and resources may help: No, mindfulness isn’t helpful for everyone.

In moderation, a small amount of stress can help us feel motivated and complete tasks. However, when stress is too intense or lasts for a long time, it can affect our day-to-day life and even our physical and mental health. You may not be able to avoid stress, but there are ways to manage it before it becomes overwhelming. Our guide explains the ins and outs of stress and techniques to help you manage and reduce your stress. Download guide To help you better understand what stress is and ways to cope with it, this page covers: Stress is a natural, human response to situations that feel difficult to manage or out of our control. It might be a feeling of pressure in response to a heavy workload, or overwhelm after an argument with a loved one. It could also be the thoughts that keep you awake at night when worrying about money. Yes, stress affects us all – sometimes in very different ways. However, stress can become overwhelming if we deem the situation to be unmanageable, creating various emotional and physical challenges that can vary in strength from person to person. Stress is like carrying a heavy backpack; at first, we don’t notice its burden and keep pushing forward. But, over time, as more items are added to the bag – such as responsibilities and worries – the load becomes heavier and increasingly difficult to manage. So, if we don’t figure out how to deal with stress, it can affect our everyday life through how it affects our physical and mental health, relationships, and ability to complete everyday tasks.1-3 The effects of stress on the body can be triggered by the release of hormones which allow us to deal with pressures or threats. Continued release of these hormones over a long time can cause physical symptoms of stress such as: Alongside these physical symptoms of stress, you may also experience common behavioural and emotional symptoms. These are: These are just some of the common symptoms of stress – it’s not an exhaustive list. Plus, symptoms of stress can vary depending on what’s causing it. Many different situations can cause stress, and this can change depending on our age. For instance, stress in teenagers may be caused by exams, bullying, or difficult family situations. In comparison, young and older adults may struggle with stress relating to employment or significant events like becoming a parent and managing long-term health conditions. However, in general, the following are some of the most common causes of stress: It’s important to note that these are not the only causes of stress. If you or someone you know is struggling with stress, it may be due to any one of these factors, or it may be something else entirely. As mentioned, stress is a natural response to problems or threats. In fact, our bodies are designed to cope with stress in effective ways. However, stress can become a problem when we don’t experience any relief or ‘downtime’.  As long-term stress can be damaging to our mental and physical health, it’s important to know how to reduce stress through daily coping skills. Let’s explore some tips for stress relief. Understanding when stress is causing you a problem is the first step in recognising how it’s affecting your life and ways to take proactive stress management steps. By doing so, you can intervene before it leads to problems for mental and physical health.  To understand when stress is causing you a problem, try to connect your feelings or physical signs with the pressures you’re facing in your life. Remember to look out for the physical warnings, such as tense muscles, over-tiredness, headaches or migraines, as well as emotional signs like irritability and forgetfulness. Stress can be caused by one big issue or a build-up of many small ones. However, not understanding the causes of your stress can make it harder for you to manage as you could feel overwhelmed.  Once you notice feelings of stress in your body or mind, try to pause for a moment. What happened right before you noticed these feelings? Tracking your physical and mental sensations of stress over a couple of days or weeks can help you pinpoint where they’re coming from and where in your life you could make changes.  Download our guide to get our worksheet to help you to identify what’s causing you stress (aka ‘stressors’) and how to tackle it. Think about whether there are any stressors related to your lifestyle, like your work or relationships. There will likely be things you can and can’t control. For the things you can’t control, think about if there are changes that could reduce their effect. Making major life changes can be an additional source of stress in the short term, but they could improve your health and well-being in the long run. Aside from removing stressors you can’t control from your life, you could also try to reduce daily pressures by passing over tasks to someone else when necessary or prioritising important tasks instead of trying to take on everything at once. Physical activity is one of the best stress-relief activities as it can be very effective in improving your overall wellbeing. It can also give you a natural energy boost and improve your focus and motivation. Even short bursts of activities like walking round the block or dancing in the kitchen can help. Check out ourhelpful resourceon how to find moments for movement every day.  Exercise and mental health Sleep problems are common when you’re struggling with stress, and can even make the symptoms of stress worse. Therefore, it’s important to try to get adequate rest for dealing with burnout caused by stress. For tips on getting a good night’s sleep, check out ourguide.  Sleep and mental health Certain foods can improve mood, balance hormones, and boost energy levels, so eating healthily can protect you from the physical and emotional demands of stress.  Aim to drink plenty of water and eat a mineral and vitamin-rich diet of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, complex carbohydrates, lean proteins, and omega-3 fatty acids to help support your body during times of stress.  Diet and mental health When you’re struggling with stress, it’s easy to get into a negative headspace, thinking hurtful things about yourself. In these moments, try to remind yourself that you’re not at fault. Stress has an intense effect on all of us, and it’s important to be kind to yourself. When elements of our lives seem unmanageable, routines can give us a sense of control. Sticking to a daily pattern of sleeping, eating, and exercising within reason can help you fight the effects of stress.  Shift work or freelancing can make it difficult to maintain a routine. Read our tips to help. Meaningful self-care has many mental, physical, and emotional benefits that can help people manage stress. Self-care can mean something different to everyone, so try to choose activities that are most relevant to you.  For instance, taking time just to relax, seeing friends, going for a walk or a bike ride, or watching your favourite TV series again – as long as the activity makes you feel good, that’s all that matters. Although alcohol and nicotine may feel like they provide momentary relief, alcohol is a depressant and nicotine creates cravings, and both can contribute to mental health problems in the short and long term. Mindfulness for stress management is a simple tool that can be practised anywhere, at any time.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/how-overcome-anxiety-and-fear,How to manage fear and anxiety,"This content mentions anxiety and panic attacks, which some people may find triggering. It’s normal to feel afraid and anxious sometimes, such as when managing work pressures, exam stress, money problems, and relationship issues. But when fear and anxiety symptoms become long-term or take over your life it can affect your wellbeing. This guide explains where fear and anxiety come from, how they can affect you, and ways to cope and seek support. Download publication To help you better understand what fear and anxiety are and ways to cope, this page covers: The words ‘anxiety’ and ‘fear’ are often used to describe similar feelings, such as dread and worry. However, as much as anxiety symptoms can feel like fear, they aren’t quite the same. Fear is a powerful emotion that produces a physical response which helps us react to threats or dangerous situations. Yet fear can also happen in everyday, non life-threatening events such as exams, arguments, or even during social occasions like parties. Even though fear is a natural response to situations that make us feel under pressure, when it’s out of proportion to the event that triggered it, it could be problematic. Ongoing fear can also be a symptom of mental health conditions, such as anxiety. Anxiety is a type of fear we feel around things such as health, finances, and relationships, and is a normal issue for a lot of people. Anxiety symptoms can be described as ongoing feelings of dread about something going wrong in the present or future. It can also be about something that went wrong in the past.  When anxiety lasts for a long time it can disrupt everyday life, such as the ability to sleep, concentrate, and socialise. It can also lead you to believe that you’re unable to cope with daily tasks, holding you back from enjoying life and creating a cycle where anxiety becomes worse and affects your mental health. There are many types of anxiety which can cause people to worry about different things, and it’s normal to experience symptoms of more than one.  Some of the most common types of anxiety are listed below. Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is when you worry about lots of different things and these fears feel disproportionate and out of control. As GAD can increase the risk of sleeping difficulties, mood problems, concentration issues, and physical symptoms, it can affect daily life.1 Social anxiety is an intense fear of social situations. It includes symptoms like avoiding socialising, fear of public speaking, worrying a lot before social events, feeling like you’re being criticised by others, and physical symptoms such as trembling and sweating.2 Health anxiety is when someone worries a lot about being or becoming ill. It can take over daily life as it includes symptoms such as frequently scanning the body for signs of sickness, seeking constant reassurance from medical professionals, and physical feelings of actually being ill.3 A phobia is an extreme fear of a particular animal, thing, place or situation. Phobias affect everyday life as they can cause an overwhelming need to avoid the source of fear. Even the thought of coming into contact with the cause of fear can potentially intensify anxiety or panic attacks.4 A panic attack is when you feel overwhelmed by physical and mental feelings of fear. It’s a type of anxiety attack, in which people might find it hard to breathe, feel like they’re having a heart attack, or are losing control of their body. If you experience physical symptoms such as tightness in your chest or shortness of breath, it’s important to speak to a healthcare professional to rule out other underlying causes. Long-term anxiety and fear can be overwhelming, especially if you don’t know why you’re experiencing them or if they feel out of proportion to the situation. If fear and anxiety are affecting your daily life, speaking to a mental health professional for support and advice may be the best first step towards managing them.  In the meantime, there are practical anxiety relief actions you can take to cope with your fears. Recognising that you’re feeling anxious and where it’s coming from is a great step toward learning how to overcome it. You can do this by paying attention to your feelings and writing down a name for them. For example, do you feel concerned, scared, or nervous? Recognising these feelings can help you figure out where they come from. Try to remember what was happening when you first noticed fear; where were you, who were you with, and what was said? When we pinpoint a trigger, we can start noticing our thoughts around it and how they make us feel anxious. With practice, we can even challenge negative thoughts and beliefs, and replace them with more accurate ones. If you notice anxiety starting to build, you can stop it from taking over by managing it in the moment. One way of doing this is practising one-minute mindfulness, as it’s a great way to quickly and easily reset your mind and body. Try to find a comfortable place to sit or stand, pay attention to the sensations in your body, concentrate on your breathing, and notice how the feelings in your body change in response. Another useful way of managing your anxiety in the moment is to keep a list of statements or reminders about yourself to hand. Make these statements meaningful to you, for instance, ‘I feel fearful, but it doesn’t define who I am as a person’. Testing your fears and whether the situation is as bad as you expect it to be gives you the chance to see anxiety for what it is and build confidence. You can test your fears by setting small, achievable goals. For example, if you have social anxiety, you could reduce fear by smiling at people in passing. Then, as your comfort levels increase, you can build up to bigger tasks such as saying ‘hello,’ asking questions, or starting a conversation. After you attempt each small goal, try writing down what went well and how what happened compared to your fears. Many people judge themselves for feeling anxious, but it’s a normal emotion, so you don’t have to deal with it alone. The act of talking about anxiety can help reduce it and encourage you to seek more support if needed. If you have a friend or family member you feel confident will respond supportively, perhaps consider opening up to them about what’s going on. If you feel nervous about speaking to them, you could prepare for the conversation by noting down a few things you want to say or sending them an email to read ahead of time. The body and mind are connected, so even short bursts of movement, such as a ten-minute walk or gentle stretches can be good for anxiety relief. Exercise also boosts ‘feel good’ chemicals in the brain, improving mood and taking your mind off your fears.5 Boost your mood by moving more When we’re anxious, we may not realise that we’re not taking any ‘downtime,’ and end up increasing our worries. Finding meaningful ways to relax can be an enjoyable method of reducing the physical and mental feelings of fear. Relaxation means something different for everyone; for you, it might mean taking a bath, reading a book, or relaxation techniques like deep breathing and mindfulness meditation. Many of us don’t realise the link between anxiety and diet. For example, caffeine can lead to feelings of nervousness and a high-sugar diet can cause blood sugar to drop and make you feel anxious. So try to avoid eating a lot of sugar or drinking too much tea and coffee. Try to eat regularly to stop your blood sugar levels from dipping and make you feel tired or bad tempered. For more information on a healthy diet, visit theNHS Eatwell guide. Diet and mental health People often drink alcohol when feeling fearful or stressed – it’s where the saying ‘Dutch courage’ comes from! But alcohol can make us feel even more fearful or anxious when its effects wear off as it has a depressant effect on the brain. Plus, we may also have low blood sugar or feel tired and dehydrated after alcohol. It can even lead to what many people call ‘hangxiety.’7 So, if you feel fearful or stressed, try to avoid using alcohol as an anxiety coping mechanism. Our guide onhow to manage and reduce stressoffers healthy ways of coping with stress. Religion or spirituality can help people feel connected to something bigger than themselves. If you are a person of faith, attending places of worship or meeting with faith groups can help you cope with everyday stress and connect you with a support network. If fear or anxiety is affecting your ability to live a full life, there is support available to you, such as the following options. Talking therapies have proven to be very effective in helping people with anxiety management. Depending on your fear and anxiety symptoms and causes, your GP may recommend one of the following talking therapies:  If you would like more information on a suitable talking therapy for your anxiety, your GP may be able to help.  In England, you can also refer yourself toNHS Talking Therapies.  In Scotland theLiving Life servicecan be accessed through NHS 24. In Wales,Silver Cloudis accessible through their website. In Northern Ireland visitCommunity Wellbeingfor support. If anxiety is affecting your day-to-day life, your doctor may talk to you about the option of anxiety medications. Medications for anxiety include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).7  Anxiety medications treat the symptoms rather than the root causes. Therefore, while they often play an important role in anxiety management, they may be most useful when combined with other treatments, such as talk therapy. Local anxiety support groups can help you learn a lot about anxiety management as they bring together people with similar experiences. In such groups, opportunities to share stories and provide tips and encouragement for coping with anxiety are openly given. MindandReThink Mental Illnessboth offer online support forums.

We all feel anxious sometimes, but anxiety may be a mental health problem if your feelings are very strong or last a long time. A panic attack is a feeling of sudden and intense fear. It can come on quickly and for no apparent reason. Panic attacks can be very frightening, but they’re not dangerous. Anxiety is a type of fear usually associated with the thought of a threat or something going wrong in the future, but can also arise from something happening right now. In this report, we explore anxiety and understand the role that it plays in our lives, for better and for worse. Home of Mental Health Awareness Week"
https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/how-sleep-better,How to sleep better,"This content mentions depression and anxiety, which some people may find triggering. Sleep and mental health are closely related. Quality sleep supports balanced emotions, focus, and overall well-being. On the other hand, poor sleep can contribute to or worsen mental health conditions like anxiety and depression. This article explores the key factors that can affect sleep, common sleep challenges people face, and practical steps to restore healthy rest. Download our free sleep guide Download our free sleep diary Cymraeg Sleep plays a vital role in our mental health, influencing mood, focus, memory, and overall well-being. When we sleep well, our brains process emotions more effectively, our immune systems function better, and we’re able to think clearly and handle stress. The relationship between sleep and mental health goes two ways: people experiencing conditions such as anxiety or depression are more likely to struggle with insomnia, while poor sleep can worsen the symptoms of these conditions.1 A variety of factors, including physical health, environment, mindset, and lifestyle, can disrupt the quality and quantity of rest. The next section takes a closer look at these. The four pillars of good sleep can be remembered using the acronymHEAL. Read more As mentioned earlier, sleep deprivation and mental health have a two-way relationship. Poor sleep can increase the risk of mental health problems, which can then further disrupt sleep. Some examples of how mental health issues can affect sleep quality include: Sleep problems affect up to one-third of the population, influencing how we feel, think, and function. Below are some of the most common sleep problems: Socioeconomic factors and sleep are also connected. This is because sleep quality isn’t only affected by biology and mental health; it’s often also shaped by our life circumstances. Life circumstances can affect sleep in the following ways: Importantly, many of these factors are outside a person’s control, making it vital to consider social context when supporting healthy sleep. Working out the reasons behind poor sleep can be difficult. Keeping a sleep diary can help people identify patterns and triggers. For example, track the following for at least a week: This personal record can reveal helpful insights and provide valuable information for healthcare professionals if you seek further support.

It is where we spend much of our time, where we get our income and often where we make new friends. Having a fulfilling job can be good for your mental health and wellbeing. Everyone deserves a mentally friendly workplace where they can thrive. Both employers and employees have a role in in creating this. Read our guide on how to support both your mental health and your colleagues’ at work. Download publication Mental health is the way we think and feel and our ability to deal with the ups and downs of life. We all have mental health, just as we all have physical health. When we enjoy good mental health, we have a sense of purpose and direction, the energy to do the things we want to do, and the ability to deal with the challenges that happen in our lives. We all have times when we feel down, stressed or frightened. Most of the time those feelings pass, but sometimes they develop into a mental health problem like anxiety or depression, which can impact on our daily lives. For some people, mental health problems become complex and require support and treatment for life. Factors like poverty, genetics, childhood trauma, discrimination, or ongoing physical illness can make it more likely that we will develop mental health problems. But mental health problems can happen to anybody. We have a wide range of legal rights that protect our mental health at work. These range from basic human rights such as the right to freedom of expression and freedom of association, to the health and safety legislation that keeps us safe from hazards, including psychological hazards. People with ongoing mental health problems are likely to meet the definition of having a disability under the Equality Act (2010) in England, Scotland and Wales and the Disability Discrimination Act (1995, as amended) in Northern Ireland. This means that people with mental health problems are protected from discrimination and harassment and are entitled to reasonable adjustments to adapt their job or work. We can all take steps to improve our own mental health, and build our resilience – our ability to cope with adversity. Self-care is a skill that needs to be practised. It isn’t easy especially if we feel anxious, depressed or low in self-esteem. Try looking through the 10 evidence-based ways to improve your mental health below. There’s bound to be one or two you do well. These can be yourassets– your go-to methods for working on your wellbeing. Look for one or two you find hard. These can be yourchallenges. It may be that these areas are the ones you neglect under stress. Finally, look for one or two areas that you feel you could work on or try. These can begoals. Your goals and challenges can be the same but it’s sometimes kinder to yourself to have some goals that you can meet more easily. You can use theworksheet in our guide(p28-29) to write down your assets, challenges and goals. Talking about your feelings can help you maintain your mental health and deal with times when you feel troubled. It can be hard to talk about feelings at work. If you have colleagues you can talk to, or a manager who asks how you are at supervision sessions, it can really help. Identify someone you feel comfortable with and who will be supportive. If you don’t feel able to talk about feelings at work, make sure there’s someone you can discuss work pressures with – partners, friends and family can all be a sounding board. Regular movement can boost your self-esteem and can help you concentrate, sleep, and generally feel better. Movement doesn’t just mean doing sport or going to the gym. Experts say that most adults should do some form of physical activity every day. Try to make physical activity that you enjoy a part of your day. Movement and mental health What we eat can affect how we feel both immediately and in the longer term. A diet that is good for your physical health is also good for your mental health. It can be hard to keep up a healthy pattern of eating at work. Regular meals, plus plenty of water, are ideal. Try and plan for mealtimes at work – bringing food from home or choosing healthy options when buying lunch. Some people find public eating at work very stressful because of past or current eating disorders. So, if someone doesn’t want to come to work dinners, or makes different food choices in the office, don’t pass comment or put pressure on them to join in. Diet and mental health We often drink alcohol to change our mood. Some people drink to deal with fear or loneliness, but the effect is only temporary. Most people don’t drink at work – but most of us recognise the pattern of drinking more at the weekend or in the evening when work is hard going. Be careful with work functions that include drinking. It can be tempting to have a drink to get ‘Dutch courage’, but if you feel anxious you may drink too much and end up behaving in a way you’d rather not, which will increase feelings of anxiety. Alcohol and mental health Relationships are key to our mental health. Working in a supportive team is hugely important for our mental health at work. We don’t always have a choice about who we work with, and if we don’t get on with managers, colleagues or clients, it can create tension. It may be that you need to practise more self-care at these times, but you may also need to address difficulties. Work politics can be a real challenge when we have mental health problems. It can be helpful to find a mentor or a small group of trusted colleagues with whom you can discuss feelings about work – to sense check and help you work through challenges. Try and make sure you maintain your friendships and family relationships even when work is intense – a work–life balance is important. None of us are superhuman. We all sometimes overwhelmed by how we feel or when things don’t go to plan. Your employer may have an Employee Assistance Programme. These services are confidential and can be accessed free and without work finding out. You may also be able to access occupational health support through your line manager or HR service. The first port of call in the health service is your GP. Your GP may suggest ways that you or your family can help you, or they may refer you to a specialist or another part of the health service. Get help A change of scene or a change of pace is good for your mental health. It could be a five-minute pause from what you are doing, a book or podcast during the commute, a half-hour lunch break at work, or a weekend exploring somewhere new. Sleep is essential to our mental health. Without good sleep, our mental health suffers and our concentration goes downhill.  Getting good sleep can be particularly difficult if you work in shift patterns or irregular hours.Check out our guide on sleep and mental health. When we are stressed, it can seem even harder to take the breaks we are entitled to – when we need them most. Try and plan periods of leave for the year so that you always have a break to look forward to. When you are on leave or at home, resist the temptation to check in with work. If you find that you can’t break away, it may be a sign that you should be re-examining your workload to manage stress. What do you love doing? What activities can you lose yourself in? What did you love doing in the past? Enjoying yourself can help reduce stress. Doing an activity you enjoy probably means you’re good at it, and achieving something boosts your self-esteem.9 Concentrating on a hobby, like gardening or doing crosswords, can help you forget your worries for a while and can change your mood. If possible, you should plan your workload to include tasks you know you are good at, so as to ‘sandwich’ things you know will be harder or more stressful. We’re all different. It’s much healthier to accept that you’re unique than to wish you were more like someone else. Feeling good about yourself boosts your confidence to learn new skills, visit new places and make new friends. Good self-esteem helps you cope when life takes a difficult turn. Be proud of who you are. Recognise and accept the things you may not be good at, but also focus on what you can do well. Try not to invest in only building self-esteem around work success. This can create a risk that when things go wrong, it can be really tough. Instead, try to balance this with things you do outside of work, too. Caring for others is often an important part of keeping up relationships with people close to you. Working life can provide opportunities to care for others – contributing through vocational jobs like nursing or care work can be hugely significant for mental health. Working in caring based industries may mean you need additional support from friends, family, and your employer in managing the emotions involved in caring.  In other jobs, you can choose to be there for colleagues – either as a team-mate, or as a line manager, when strategies like coaching and training are good ways to support others.  Talking about mental health can seem daunting, but we’ve all had conversations with people about bereavements, breakups and other life events. They’re not always easy, but they often mean a lot to a person having a tough time. It all starts with asking someone how they are doing in a warm and authentic way – giving them a chance to realise that you are being sincere and friendly. Read our tips on talking to a colleague about their mental health.  There’s a time and place for everything – and when it comes to talking with someone about their mental health, that means a time and place that is most comfortable for them. Listening is vital for every relationship. Active listening is a term for a range of techniques that keep us present and engaged in a conversation.  It can be hard to hear difficult or upsetting things, but you want to reassure and encourage the person – that means not showing signs of surprise or judgement. You want to reassure the person that it’s OK to be speaking to you, and that you will treat what they say with respect. It is tempting to immediately start suggesting solutions to problems – but it’s wise to ask a person what they want to happen. They may welcome suggestions, but, equally, they may just need to vent.  It is a myth that talking about suicide makes it more likely. If you are concerned that a colleague might be having thoughts of suicide, the best thing you can do is ask them directly. You can ask ‘Have you had thoughts about suicide?’ during a conversation about someone’s mental health. If your colleague says they are feeling suicidal or can’t go on, or if you suspect they are thinking of taking their own life, it is important to encourage them to get help. They could contact the Samaritans straight away – they can call 116 123 for free. You could also help them to call their doctor or a close friend or colleague. If you are concerned for someone’s immediate safety, or they tell you that they plan to end their life imminently, you can call 999 and ask for the police or take them to an A&E Department.  Most people who develop mental health problems recover well, if they have the right support from the people in their lives. For some people, an episode of mental ill-health is a one-off – triggered by events. Equally, there may be no cause at all. For others, mental health problems can be longer term, or episodic over a lifetime. Recovery isn’t the same thing as cure – often people learn to live with aspects of their mental health problem. Supporting a colleague who has a mental health problem is about helping them to find ways to recover, helping them to stay well, and ensuring that the workplace is a safe and pleasant place to be, free from discrimination.

What might surprise you is that this is actually backed up byresearch. Those of us who arekind andcompassionateexperience clear benefits to ourwell-beingandhappiness. We mayeven live longer. Kindness alsohelps reduce stress and improve our emotional well-being.1,2 We all have so much going onin our liveswithcompetingstrains and stresses sometimes pushing kindness to one side, in favour of what is urgentnow. Itcan be easy to showkindnesswhenposting online, but when it comes to reality it's hardertocommit to kindnessin ourreal-lifewords and actions. By taking thetimetobekindtoothers, wecan benefit from emotional upsides.It reallydoes make a difference, especially for people who are vulnerable or struggling. With everything that's going on in the world, now is the time to help make a kinder society that improves our mental health. Kindness should be built into business decisions, government policy, and other official systems in a way that supports everyone’s mental health and also reduces discrimination and inequality. That can start with individual commitments to showing kindness in our words and our actions. This guide is written to demonstrate the positive effect that helping others can have on your own mental health, including some suggestions that will inspire you. Take a few minutes, have a read, and think about doing something kind for a friend or a stranger today. Mark Rowland, CEO of the Mental Health Foundation Kindness is choosing to do something that helps others or yourself, motivated by genuine warm feelings. Kindness, or doing good, often means putting other people’s needs before our own. It could be by giving up our seat on a bus to someone who might need it more, or offering to make a cup of tea for someone at work. Evidence shows that helping others can also benefit our own mental health and wellbeing. For example, it can reducestressas well as improve mood, self-esteem and happiness.1–3 There are so many ways to help others as part of our everyday lives. Good deeds needn’t take much time or cost any money. Small changes can make a big difference. This guide gives you tips on how to bring kindness into your life. We will look in more detail at: Studies have found that acts of kindness are linked to increased feelings of well-being.1Helping others can also improve our support networks and encourage us to be more active.4This, in turn, can improve our self-esteem.5There is some evidence to suggest that whenwehelp others, it can promote changes in the brain that are linked with happiness.2 It creates a sense of belonging and reduces isolation Helping others is thought to be one of the ways that people create, maintain, and strengthen their social connections. For example, volunteering and helping others can help us feel a sense of belonging, make new friends,and connect with our communities.5,6 It helps to keep things in perspective Many people don’t realise the impacta different perspective can have on their outlookonlife. There is some evidence that being aware of our own acts of kindness, as well as the things we are grateful for, can increase feelings of happiness, optimism and satisfaction.7,8 Doing good may help you to have a more positive outlook about your own circumstances. It helps to make the world a happier place – one act of kindness can often lead to more! Acts of kindness can make the world a happier place for everyone. They canboostfeelingsof confidence, being in control, happiness and optimism.8 Theymay also encourage others to repeat the gooddeedsthey’veexperienced themselves–contributing to a more positive community.9 The more you do for others, the more you do for yourself The benefits of helping others can last long after the act itself, forthose who offer kindness, and those who benefit. This, in turn, can improve our self-esteem.5 Acts of kindness can be mutually helpful, especially when we reach out to others in ways that feel good to ourselves! If you’re trying to connect with a friend or loved one, why not suggest an activity that you both enjoy – playing a sport you share together, going to the cinema or planning a night in for you both. You can also share your skills, offering to help someone you know or in the community with technology, recipes, DIY, or crafts. It’s a great way to feel valued, while showing genuinely helpful kindness to someone else! Althoughactsof kindnessfor other people can makeusfeelgood,we need toalsokeep in mind why we’re doing it–which is fortheir benefit, not ours. Part of being kind is considering the feelings of others, so it isvery important that your kindness issomething which others will findhelpful. Kindness issomething that needs to benefit both parties. See what you can do that othersarenotdoing already.For example,ifyou want to donate to a foodbank,see what they need before buying things. It’s important to make surewedon’toverdo it! If wefind we are giving too much of ourselves or have gone beyond our means, it’s probably time to take a step back.It’s very easy to give awayall ofour energy, especially if we are finding things hard ourselves and want to focus on others. Leave enough for you–kindnesshas tostart with yourself. We recommend starting small, so wedo notbecome overwhelmed or give more than we are financially able. Helping others doesn’t have to cost money or take a lot of time.Itcould start with calling afriend we haven’t spoken to in awhileordonating a small amount of money monthly to a charity close toourheart and within our budget.10 Volunteering is a great way to help others and research shows thatitbenefits people of all ages, by increasing feelings of self-esteem, socialconnection,and well-being.5 If you have friends or neighbours who are finding things difficult at the moment, see what you can do to help. Here are some ideasaboutgettinginvolved: To find out more about volunteering opportunities,check out our suggested organisations at the end of this guide. Getting involved with a cause that is close to your heart can be hugely beneficial for both thecauseandyour own sense of well-being.4,10 For example, if you want to help protect the environment, you could get involved in a local tree-planting scheme. You could start by identifying a few local organisations to contact about how they can use volunteers. There are lots of other ways you can get involved: Whatever you decide to do, make sure you have fun with it! We have lots of ways toget involvedwith the Mental Health Foundation. You can emailsupporter@mentalhealth.org.uk. You can also follow us on Facebook and Instagram @mentalhealthfoundation and X @mentalhealth. Acts of kindness have the potential to make the world a happier place.1,7,8 We want to see a world where kindness is built into business decisions, government policy and official systems. However, we can start by individual commitment to showing kindness in our words and our actions. You might want to do something for someone else or take note if you experiencean actof kindness. Not sure where to start?We’ve put together some suggestions to help you out... Evidence shows that being kind really does improve your wellbeing1 While we know that we don't do things for others for what we can get out of it, we also know that the more we do for others, the more they are likely to do for us.11 With this in mind, try to help others once a day for a week and see if it makes a difference in how we feel. You can take joy in being deliberately kind – whether by recognising the time you have for your kids or partner, speaking more to family or volunteering in your community. Try to keep track of: Remember to make a note of how they made you feel. You could even keep a diary! Write down three things you are grateful for each day, or simply say these to yourself as the day draws to a close. Whatever you can manage today is good enough.If things are hard for you right now, try and find some small thingsto celebrateeach day. Some days getting up and washing your hair is an achievement, and you can celebrate it as such! Try to tune out the voice of judgement and comparison and tune in to the voice that says you are enough. Mental Health Foundation- Our vision is of good mental health for all.

There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. Around 20% of young people have self-harmed.1That’s equivalent to one in every five teens. There are many reasons why a young person might self-harm. It could be due to bullying, difficulties at home, low self-esteem or something else entirely. If you are a young person and you have self-harmed or considered self-harming, it’s important to know that it’s possible to learn new ways to cope. With support and information, you can begin to feel better. Our guide will help you understand more about self-harm and what to do if you are worried about yourself or someone else. Download the guide To help you learn about self-harm and tips to cope, this page covers: Self-harm typically refers to behaviours that lead to bodily harm as a result of overwhelming feelings or difficult emotions. Self-harm can take many forms, such as: Self-harm usually starts because a young person has a build-up of difficult or distressing feelings that they want to manage. The relief that comes from self-harm is temporary and is quickly followed by guilt and shame. This becomes a cycle which can feel difficult to get out of. It’s important to remember that most people who hurt themselves don’t want to die. It’s often a way for them to cope with overwhelming and distressing thoughts or feelings. Nevertheless, it’s important to take self-harm seriously. Self-harming behaviour isn’t always obvious. However, you can look out for the following signs that might suggest someone is hurting themselves: These signs may not always mean someone is self-harming. They could indicate a mental health difficulty such as anxiety or depression. It’s also possible that there will be no warning signs when someone is hurting themselves. If you’re worried someone may be self-harming, it’s important to speak openly, honestly, and without blame. For tips on how to talk to someone about self-harm, read our full guide. Download the guide There isn’t one single reason why people self-harm. Some young people feel more of an urge to self-harm when they’re angry, while others turn to self-harm when they’re worried or depressed. Often, it comes down to not knowing how to express the emotions they are feeling.2 Some events that may trigger the urge to self-harm include2: If you have experienced one or more of these things and you are finding it difficult to cope, know that there are many alternatives to self-harm. Talking to someone you trust or a healthcare professional can help you find other ways to cope. Once you start self-harming, it can be difficult to stop. Yet, learning alternative strategies to manage your emotions when you feel distressed or upset can help you get out of this cycle. Here are four strategies you can use to cope with your difficult feelings instead of self-harming. It can help to talk to a friend, family member or adult you trust when you feel overwhelmed. Letting someone know what you are thinking and feeling can relieve some of the pressure. If you’re unsure how to start the conversation, try writing out what you want to say or using a list of words to describe your emotions. If you’re still nervous about opening up and don’t know where to start, you could say:  A safe box is a toolkit that can help you when you’re feeling overwhelmed and have the urge to harm yourself. You can include whatever keeps you calm and makes you feel good in your safe box. Here are some examples of what you might include: Self-harm does not define you. There is more to you than self-harm.

Speaking to someone about what you’re going through can not only help you feel less alone, but their support can also be the first step towards recovery.

However, UK adults still struggle with theirbody image. This tells us two things: This means body image concerns are real, they are common, and we don’t need just to ignore how we feel about ourselves. Most of us would agree that we still need more information about body image – especially on changing our body image to be healthier. Healthy body image = acceptance Healthy body image ≠ perfection Research shows that aiming for an unrealistic ideal can create unhelpful attitudes about ourselves. We begin to seek perfection based on the ideals that we see around us. Even though we know, really, no one is perfect – we sometimes convince ourselves that we should aim toward perfection. The result? We feel like we’re never enough. We can’t reach perfection, so we’re always reaching. It’s exhausting. And it doesn’t lead to a healthy body image. Working towards acceptance, not perfection, can lead to a healthier body image. Body image issues can affect all of us at any age and directly affect our mental health. However, there is still a lack of much-needed research and understanding. 9th Oct 2025

It takes practice and time, and everyone’s paths are different. Here are some tips to help you maintain a healthy sense of self. Recognise unrealistic body images posted on social media. Follow groups or people with different ideas. If you start seeing pictures that make you uncomfortable or unhappy, try unfollowing the pages, so they don’t keep showing in your feed. Try not to pick up unrealistic ideas about what your body should look like. Social media often has a shiny filter to make things look ‘perfect’. It may help to educate yourself on the average UK body sizes to bring some perspective. There is a broader range of body shapes and sizes than the limited range you might see online. Being online for long periods means you can be mentally exhausted without even knowing about it. Whether you ‘follow’ influencers or friends online, taking a break from social media is always a good idea. Think about setting a limit on how long you’re online each day and have a go at a ‘No-social-media-Sunday’. You’ll feel better for taking that space. Instead, use the time to go out and do something you enjoy- connect with nature and see friends in person. Practice gratitude for everything your body does for you, not just how it looks. After all, your body carries you through life. Appreciating all that your body does can lead to self-acceptance and a much more positive body image. Supporting each other and receiving positive comments from those we care about can affect us more than a ‘like’ or a comment from someone we barely know. Be honest in setting boundaries in your group so everyone knows what is positive for everyone to hear. Not only will you feel better but your friends will too. It’s a win-win situation! People come in all shapes, sizes and shades, with scars, markings or skin textures. Sometimes these differences can make us feel self-conscious about ourselves. We all feel self-conscious sometimes, but we can re-focus our minds to become more accepting of our uniqueness. We can become proud of what makes us special. After all, variety is the spice of life! Speak to and about yourself as you would talk to a friend. You wouldn’t point out a friend’s flaws so try not to point out your own. How we think and speak about ourselves or how others talk about our bodies is then internalised as the standard. If we challenge negative comments and work to change that narrative, then we can internalise positive messages about our own bodies. If you’re feeling a little down about your body image or a particular ‘flaw’, it can help to find like-minded people who struggle with the same things. You aren't alone with whatever you’re feeling, so don’t be alone with your thoughts either. It may help to open up and chat with others. A good place to start might beYoungMinds. It’s easy to see dieting pills, steroids or cosmetic treatments as a quick way to achieve your goal. Before making any decisions about products, find out first if the product is safe, tested, and ethical. Know the product and be safe. Many treatments are only available from a doctor, so if you see them available from elsewhere, be very sceptical. Although the products used in the non-surgical cosmetic industry are standardised, there are currently no standards for the training and qualifications of the person doing the procedure. If you decide that a procedure is right for you, research sites such asJCCP (Joint Council for Cosmetic Practitioners)orSave Face. Read up and ask questions about aftercare, insurance, risks and possible bad reactions. Surveys show that a big motivation (43%) for cosmetic surgery is increasing confidence and self-esteem. Talk to your friends about the reasons behind getting treatment. Is it to look better or feel better? If it’s about self-esteem, it’s a good idea to talk to someone about that first. Help your friends to ask questions about possible risks, aftercare, insurance, and costs. It’s easy when complimenting someone to focus on their appearance, such as ‘you look like you’ve lost weight' or ‘you look like you’ve gained some muscle’. There isn’t anything wrong with this but consider that if someone receives compliments about their image, they will apply a higher worth to how they look and feel more pressure to look a certain way. Switch it up and compliment someone’s skills or personality. Let them know that what you like about them is on the inside, not just the outside. Body image concerns are real, they are familiar, and we don’t need to just ignore how we feel about ourselves. Body image issues can affect all of us at any age and directly affect our mental health. However, there is still a lack of much-needed research and understanding. 9th Oct 2025

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/body-image-and-mental-health/mind-over-mirror/parenting-healthy-body-image,Mind Over Mirror - Parenting for a healthy body image,"This content was co-created with a diverse group of parents who know the challenge of modern parenting first-hand. We hope it provides a starting point for parents to navigate the topic ofbody imagewith their 'tweens' and teens. We asked teenagers what they thought about when they heard this loaded word. For teens and tweens, ‘perfection’ conjures up images of smooth-as-silk skin, dazzling faces, shining hair, edgy; flawlessly put-together; stylised. After much prompting, then came the associations of ‘perfection’ with school grades, behaviour – all those other 'minor' considerations (minor for them, anyway!). Of course, ask those same teens if anyone has achieved perfection, and they show how clued up they really are on this topic. They know it ’s unachievable. They know those 'Insta-perfect'  models use filters, lighting, make-up, angles – all the tricks to achieve that ‘flawless’ shot. They know more about all that than we parents do! Does knowing that it’s fake make a difference? It seems not. Many teens still aim to achieve perfection, despite knowing how unachievable it is. From social media to the school gates, the influences on body image are many and difficult to escape. This guide explores some ways parents can explore these important topics of body image with tweens and teens. As part of Mental Health Awareness Week 2019, the Mental Health Foundation published research onBody image: How we think and feel about our bodies. The research shows that body image is closely connected to our sense of self, our well-being, and our mental health. We know that body image matters. The challenge for parents is often knowing what we can do to help our kids develop and maintain a healthy body image. We hear much talk nowadays of ‘healthy’ and ‘unhealthy’ body image. But what does a healthy body image even look like? For one thing, having a healthy body image is not about how healthy we are or about how we look. It’s really about how we feel about our bodies. Health and other factors can influence our body image. Body satisfaction and appreciation have been linked to better well-being and less unhealthy dieting. In a world that seems to value appearance above everything else, our own behaviour as parents can either increase or decrease the effects of social media and peers. Research tells us that our body image is greatly affected by our relationships. Some people say that we shouldn’t compliment our children’s appearance. Others would disagree with that. After all, who doesn’t like to hear those words: “You look nice”. The question is… How much do we value our children for looking a certain way? Do we reinforce the view that appearance equals value? Complimenting children’s appearance can bring an embarrassed reaction, or they might reject the compliment entirely. However, there’s no downside to complimenting behaviours and attitudes. Giving compliments that are about character, attitudes or actions can build up a positive self-image that isn’t related to how we look. They can help children feel valued for something that they can build upon. There’s nothing wrong with complimenting our child on how they look. Try to also use plenty of character-based compliments throughout the day. Character-based compliments reinforce the idea that we are each valuable because of who we are, not because of how we look. Compliment your child on how they look: Now try complimenting them on something that they are: Notice: What is the difference in how your child responds to each type of compliment? Which one seems to make them feel happier, or more connected to you? We parents can easily fall into the trap of comparing our children to others, even when making favourable comparisons. We want our children to make good, healthy choices. Sometimes we undermine their confidence by comparing them, positively or negatively, to other people. This promotes the habit of comparing ourselves with others, often leading to negative self-comparisons. Child: ""Her skin is perfect."" Parent: ""You have good skin as well"" This parent is well-meaning. They want to build their child up, in comparison to others. Body comparisons can be a trap. We can acknowledge the comment (“Yes, she does”), without making comparisons between the other person and our own child. Child: ""Her skin is so perfect."" Parent: ""Well you would have perfect skin too, if you stopped eating all that sugary junk!"" OUCH! This parent is well-meaning too. They want their child to look healthy and be healthy. However, comments like this can reinforce body comparisons, and support a habit of negative self- comparisons. These habits can cause self-blame about how we look, which makes it very difficult to be accepting of our own appearance. Mums and dads, let’s not compare our children to others. We can promote a healthy body image by encouraging our children away from body comparisons. This builds a habit of appreciating uniqueness and individuality. Does your child edit every photo? Is every selfie filtered to ‘perfection’? If so, your teen or tween may feel self-conscious. They may find it difficult to accept their natural appearance. Filters are everywhere. They are mostly unavoidable. However, not all filters are equal. Some filters are intended to “enhance” a person’s appearance. Others are designed for laughs, for novelty or just because (I mean, why the potato-face filter? Really, just why?) When young people over-use filters to ‘perfect’ their appearance, we can balance this out by taking selfies together with them, without filters, or using funny filters instead. Photos can be a chance to remember precious times together. This is even more important with teenagers when spending time together happens less easily. Make the most of the selfie trend by doing a selfie shoot together. The aim is to have a laugh and create memories for you to keep. Note: the aim is not to post the photos all over social media – this could undermine your efforts, increasing your teen’s self-conscious or anxious feelings. As parents, our own body image is bound to affect how we relate to our children’s body image. Just as with our physical health, it’s hard to look after someone else if we are struggling. The Mental Health Foundation published seven tips that you can use to promote a healthy body image yourself. It may be a surprise to know that young people are increasingly the target audience for cosmetic surgeries and treatments advertisements. From surface-level procedures like skin treatments through to invasive surgeries, young people today are bombarded by one primary message: “Your natural look is just not good enough”. The Mental Health Foundation report on body imageshowed that body dissatisfaction is common and often profound in the teenage years. Whether it's acne during the teenage years or dissatisfaction with the shape of a nose or lips, the developing body is often a source of shame, embarrassment or disappointment. Advertisements for cosmetic treatments take advantage of that sensitive time of life by targeting adverts to increasingly younger audiences via social media, email adverts and high street promotions. We can’t control all the messaging and advertisements that our teens are exposed to. Judgement isn’t helpful either. But we can talk about the reality of cosmetic treatments with open honesty. Conversations that raise questions about treatments are important. Questions such as, “What are the risks?” “What are your consumer rights?” “What are the qualifications of the provider?” “What is the long-term cost?” can be raised with your teen before they go ahead with any treatment. The aim is not to cast judgement on any decisions. The aim is to enable your young person to make an informed decision, whatever they choose for themselves. This way, they can get counsel and think more deeply before making choices. Parents can either counterbalance or promote unhelpful messages in the home. Do we reinforce the idea, maybe with throwaway comments, that our children’s looks are unsatisfactory? That they aren’t good enough? That they need to ‘fix’ this or that? Or... Do we emphasise the beauty of their uniqueness? Do we highlight the value of their individuality? Do we appreciate their natural look? Do we praise the quality of their character? Do we promote a message of health and wellness rather than ‘perfection’ or inadequacy? No one can get it right all of the time. There are many influences on our teens’ and tweens’ body image. Awareness of the influences on body image and using strategies to counter unhealthy influences will go a long way towards promoting a healthy body image in your family home. Above all, fostering a healthy relationship with our kids allows for open communication and understanding, providing the building blocks for a healthier body image throughout their lives. Body image concerns are real, they are common, and we don’t need to just ignore how we feel about ourselves. Body image issues can affect all of us at any age and directly affect our mental health. However, there is still a lack of much-needed research and understanding around this. 9th Oct 2025

Before COVID-19, she worked at her local pub. In the future, she hopes to own the family caravan park and pursue a career in mental health. Here Bethan shares her experiences of kindness and the difference it makes to her mental health. Kindness is what you do to make someone smile. It can make the difference between a good and bad day. You show kindness in the hope it will make someone a little bit happier and show you care. You also feel it when someone does something to make you smile. Kindness is easy to give; it is a way of life that a lot of people may be brought up with. Even though doing an act of kindness face to face might be hard right now, you can still find other ways to be kind: Kindness is something we can all do by making someone smile or just feel the slightest bit better. After a breakdown in school, my head of year was there constantly. I missed around two weeks of school, and she helped me catch up and made me a cup of tea whenever I needed it. We also had a code word for when I really needed a chat. This made me realise that people were there for me. Other people's kindness toward me gives me reassurance that I'm not alone. Giving kindness to others shows that I'm there for them; I know they know this. It makes me feel more secure and less frightened of the world.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/body-image-and-mental-health/image-editing-apps-and-mental-health,Image-editing apps and mental health,"Our mental health is largely shaped by the circumstances in which we are born, grow, and age in, and, in turn, these circumstances are often heavily influenced by the commercial environment in which we live.1 In this context, the actions of corporations and the strategies they adopt to promote their products or services, have a significant impact on our health. It is therefore important that the power of corporations is subject to appropriate checks and balances to ensure that their behaviours align more closely with the public good.2This is particularly important to the concept of mental health security – the protection from threats to our mental health. Health security is understood in a collective way – reducing the vulnerability of communities to harms to health – and an individual way – access to safe and effective products, services and technologies.3In other words, we cannot expect that public education alone will be enough to improve people’s health, unless we also take steps to protect them from harmful factors over which they have no personal control. One industry that is growing at a significant rate year-on-year is the global app industry, with an estimated worth of $6.3 trillion by 2021.4A significant subset of this industry includes image-editing apps, which people can download from application stores (App Store, Google Play), to edit their photos. Many of these apps are free to download but encourage in-app purchases for users to unlock extra features. We consider it vital that we take action to understand how these apps influencepeople’s body image and their mental health. It is an industry that is growing largely unchecked, in a space where the potential to negatively impact people’s lives is significant. Based on this accumulating evidence, we propose the following actions: Negative comments about other people’s bodies matter. When we shame bodies, we shame people. These are lookist comments. We no longer put up with sexist comments, we don’t need to keep putting up with lookist comments. Sharing your lookism stories shows how common lookism is, calls it out, and says it’s not ok. Visit the website to find out more and use #EverydayLookism and #BeBodyKind on social media. We recognise there will be issues regarding liability. However, guidance on the definition of mental health can take this into account and this can be co-produced with the Mental Health Foundation and other experts. We recommend that at a minimum the guidelines are updated to clearly state that apps should not promote images that are outright lookist, shaming, or triggering of past trauma or eating disorders. All in-app purchases for additional features should be restricted to people over the age of 18, to ensure predatory promotion is restricted. Currently, only a handful of these apps are restricted in this way, and most have no age restrictions, thus often allowing children as young as five to download and use them. Research can take an ethical perspective in defining more clearly the line which determines which image-editing apps or features are acceptable and which are unacceptable because of the high risk they pose to mental health. All training and other programmes should employ a coproduction approach, involving children and young people in their development as well as parents and carers. There appears to be relatively little in the applied research that looks at parents in relation to body image and modelling positive behaviours. Given that parents have a significant influence on the way in which children view their bodies, parents need to be included more in the discussion about image-editing apps. This includes online or other predatory advertising in relation to image-editing apps. Advertisements that promote these apps to more vulnerable groups, for instance young people belonging to BAME communities, warrant greater scrutiny and investigation. Body image issues can affect all of us at any age and directly affect our mental health. However, there is still a lack of much-needed research and understanding around this.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/cassandras-story-importance-kindness,Cassandra's story: the importance of kindness,"Cassandra Baker is a single mum of two from Bromley and runs her own business, Baker Girl Beauty. She speaks on the importance of kindness during COVID-19 and the struggles of being a single mother. Before the lockdown, I ran a successful business called Baker Girl Beauty. This incorporated a beauty salon and training academy. I have always believed in the power of kindness to affect not only ourselves but everybody around us positively. I have affirmation cards specially made for all my customers. My regular clients love me reading a positive affirmation at the end of their treatments and always leave with a big smile on their faces. I love owning my own business in the beauty industry and making people happy. The lockdown caused by thecoronavirus pandemichas been a challenge beyond just the financial aspect. I love interacting with people and inspiring them to believe in themselves more, and this has obviously been restricted. As a single mother, having more time with my children has been wonderful, but I knew it was important for both them and me to have some purpose and structure to our lives. My daughter Saffron and I both haveADHD, and we know how vital it is for our minds to keep occupied with a positive focus. So, we started sending out cards with positive messages to anyone we felt could benefit from a kind word; friends, neighbours and relatives. Advice for the future, reminding people of how great they really are, anything that will make the receiver smile and bring a bit of happiness to their day. We don't want people to feel isolated. Even though we have to socially distance ourselves, we can still take the opportunity to be closer than ever. We started out sending one or two care packages, but we've had such a positive response that we've practically turned the living room into a card-making factory. Saffron has had an astonishing focus. My 8-year-old made over twenty cards herself in one day, all with pictures of unicorns and affirming messages of love and support. She is doing it not because she is being told to but because it genuinely makes her happy to bring a bit of sunshine into other people’s lives. People have been so genuinely appreciative of their packages that it has made me up the ante and deliver more and more. When you are being told how much difference a card or a sticker makes to someone, it inspires you to try to help others too. A kind act is like throwing a pebble in the water; the ripples spread, and kindness inspires others to be kind. Kindness has a reproduction rate of its own. The more we do individually, the kinder we become collectively, and helping each other becomes the norm, not just a few random acts of charity. I look forward to opening up my beauty salon again, but until then, I will keep sending care packages, cards, stickers and any other ways to bring a smile to people's faces. My children may miss school, but they are learning valuable life lessons. Helping others around us genuinely makes the world a better place. I am so proud of my children for the effort and creativity they are showing every day to support people who need that bit of human interaction more than ever right now. So, on that note, I would like to leave you with one of my most uplifting quotes: If you found Cassandra's story helpful and you would like to make a contribution to improving mental health for future generations, please consider a donation.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/ntales-story-why-kindness-got-me-where-i-am-today,Ntale's story: why kindness got me to where I am today,"Ntale is a psychotherapeutic counsellor and activist from South London and now works for the Mental Health Foundation. He touches on the role kindness has played in his life and how kindness has helped him be who he is today. Kindness isn’t a concept I thought a lot about as a young man. Kindness was often portrayed amongst my peers as weakness and wasn’t something that would protect you in the face of threat. Kindness wouldn’t save your phone at knifepoint, nor would it save your reputation in a fistfight. Kindness was a liability, and liability could get you hurt – even killed. At home and amongst family, though, kindness was life-affirming. Kindness was getting an extra piece of chicken at dinner. Kindness was getting that new computer game you’d been talking about since Easter, that extra piece of roti to clean up your plate at the end of a meal or being the first to play with your cousin’s new action figure. In that sense, kindness had two faces in my life. Kindness occupied two worlds in two vastly different ways. Without kindness, I wouldn’t be where I am today. Kindness in my life made a crying 15-year-old boy in a restaurant, covered in blood from his own wounds and the wounds of another, crack a smile and even laugh a little at a kind stranger’s joke. Kindness gave a young man the insight to recognise that even straight, cisgender Black men can be abused in romantic relationships, giving him the fortitude to oppose it. Kindness was a conduit for kindness, and kindness is compelling, rooting my interests and passions in bringing warmth and compassion to others. Kindness sits in me as I face my clients and enter them through an unseen pathway, nonetheless felt. When I worked as a mentor in an independent alternative school in my hometown in South London, kindness compelled a boy to bring a box of his grandmother’s stew to school to share with a classmate who regularly came to school with an empty belly and 50p in his pocket for crisps. But Kindness also taught me that we must stand together: Lastly, kindness has brought pieces of many a young man, shattered by the impact of austerity and left behind by an unkind status quo, back together again! Kindness is love, compassion, concern, generosity, solidarity, affection, care, consideration, kinship, and tenderness.Kindness is powerful, and I hope that we all feel enough of it to carry us to a better, happier post-pandemic world.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/pauls-story-my-feelings-about-my-body-image-are-work-progress,My body image has affected my confidence,"This content mentions body image or generally discusses weight, which some people may find triggering. I would sum up my current feelings about my body image as ‘a work in progress’.I’m very aware that my body isn’t anywhere near where I would like it to be from a physique perspective. However, I’m also much more conscious now of my health and have made good progress from where I was previously regarding my weight and body confidence. At times, I’ve been unhappy with my body which has affected my confidence. I have found myself, at times, becoming jealous of others due to this, which can result in me being sensitive or argumentative. I have always taken great pride in my appearance, fashion and looks and have always been outgoing and outwardly confident about this. As I was growing up, it was almost seen as a negative for a male to take pride in his appearance, and I would often be greeted with remarks or comments designed to emasculate me due to how I dressed or looked. Much of this was undoubtedly a persona, or caricature of myself, probably to mask some of my insecurities. In my teenage years, body image was viewed very differently. There was a strive to be thin, and this was what I perceived as being healthy. I was always considered quite thin up until my mid-20s. Due to working a lot of hours, I would often have a poor diet, not eat healthily or regularly, and I would gain weight due to eating the wrong foods or snacking. This extended to when I would be stressed or feeling down. I would often find comfort in taking away food, resulting in a vicious cycle of becoming more unhappy with my body. This had a huge impact when I became a dad, and juggling my work life and becoming a new parent left very little time for me to focus on exercise or personal time. I gained weight and became unhappy with my appearance, which massively dented my confidence. This spiralled when my relationship with my partner ended, and I partly blamed myself and my appearance for being cheated on. I found myself at a point where I was approaching 30 years old, a single dad and was terrified at the prospect of dating again. Historically, a super confident person, now finding myself a little bit lost in the era of technology and social media. This was a daunting prospect, but I’d say it was also the catalyst for me to focus on setting some goals for myself and my body. However unrealistic it seemed, social media and dating apps showed me a new benchmark for what people perceived as the norm... I suppose this ultimately affected me as I was much more aware of my body image and the want to change this. Various factors affect how I feel about my own body image now. I’ve been influenced by all of the above. Society as a whole has changed, with younger people now opting to use gyms as a social meeting point, whereas in my teenage years, this would probably have been a pub or club. Generally, I see many more people who are fitter and more muscular at a young age. I think this is directly related to the rise of social media, where platforms such as Instagram allow people to project a perfect image of themselves onto society. Most people will know that this is merely a staged screenshot of someone’s life, yet so many (including myself) aspire to look good due to this. Every mobile phone nowadays is used more for its camera than it is for phone calls, and with the huge increase in selfies and people wanting to show the world where they are and what they are doing, they also want to look good as they are essentially on show to the whole world. I think social media, TV, celebs, and sports stars have all created pressure in society to aspire to a certain body. I think this all creates pressure on a certain age range to look this way, too and being unable to achieve this standard will ultimately affect people mentally. I think some people could also become quite narcissistic and rely heavily on cosmetic enhancement. I think society still has some way to go on how body image is perceived by others and, ultimately, how others react to someone’s body image. Being body conscious is not exclusive to women, yet when a man takes pride in his appearance or has anxieties about his body, this is often met with a joke, sarcasm or a put down of sorts. Many women talk openly to one another about their body, their image and their feelings towards this, yet this is a conversation that a lot of men simply would not have due to being ridiculed if they were to talk openly about weight, tanning, teeth whitening, waxing or hair loss etc. I think supporting people in achieving their body goals is important without feeling pressured to conform to others. I think the dangers lie in how far some people may go to achieve this idea of perfection. More people need to realise that much of what we see on TV and in film is heavily staged with lighting and make-up, and this extends to social media. I think as a society, there needs to be an equal focus on promoting how people feel as much as how people look. This would encourage more people to be vocal about the issues they are experiencing. I think being open enough to talk about some of my struggles has helped me approach any issues I’ve had. Having kept a lot of things bottled up, I now realise that talking about some of my concerns around body image can also help encourage others to engage in conversation about theirs.

Our tips will be easier for some and harder for others. Why not give them a try and see which ones suit you best? Trying new things can sometimes feel uncomfortable, but they usually get easier the more we practise them. One thing to remember: none of us is perfect. We all have our limits. What’s good enough for you is great. Printed copies of this publication are available to purchase in our online shop. We all live with worries and fears, uncertainties, losses that leave us sad and pressures that make us feel stressed. Nature can have a really calming effect on us. We have been living around other animals and plants for thousands of years. Some people say nature helps them feel calmer, more hopeful and less alone. Our research found that going for a walk was UK adults’ favourite way of coping with stressduring the pandemic in 2020. In Japan, some people do “forest bathing”, which may improve their mental health. So going to a forest or wood and experiencing the different smells, sounds and textures may really help. To get the best out of nature’s healing effects, try tuning your senses to what’s around you – the trees, plants, birds and animals, for instance, and water such as ponds or the seashore. Take a deep breath and see how you feel. The idea is to get connected with your natural surroundings. Find out more about mental health and nature, including our guideThriving With Nature, produced with wildlife charity WWF. Anyone who has struggled with sleep will know what a difference it makes to our bodies, minds and ability to cope with life. We all have times when wesleepbadly, and some of us live in situations that make a good night’s sleep impossible. For many people, sleep is often the first thing that suffers when we're struggling with our mental health. Adults need between 7 and 9 hours' sleep a night, including enough dreaming sleep and enough deeper sleep. If you’re struggling with your sleep, think about trying a few simple changes. For example: For more suggestions, try thisguide to sleep and mental health. It includes information about potentially helpful apps and getting professional help if self-help isn’t working for you. Our bodies and minds are connected, so looking after ourselves physically also helps us prevent problems with our mental health (it works the other way around, too). Moving our bodies – with sport, gardening, dancing, cycling, walking the dog, cleaning or going to the gym, for example – are great ways to improve ourmental and physical health. Exercisereleases “feel good” hormones that reduce feelings of stress and anger. It also helps us feel better about our bodies. It can improve our sleep too. If it involves other people, like being part of a team, a class or a group we see regularly, that can also boost our mental health. We don’t have to be professional athletes, or sporty, to getthe benefits of being physically active. From walking to dancing and basketball to the gym, the best exercise is simply the one we enjoy. Food and drink affect our bodies, brains and mood – for good or bad. Sugary snacks and drinks can give us a temporary “high” or sense of comfort that can feel irresistible. But they soon leave us feeling exhausted or jittery. Caffeine in coffee, tea, or so-called energy drinks can also have this effect. A balanced dietwith lots of vegetables and fruit is essential for good physical and mental health. How we eat is also important. Having meals with other people can help to grow relationships – with family, friends, partners, and colleagues. This is really important in protecting everyone’s mental health and preventing problems. Food can also get mixed up with our feelings. Some people over-eat or under-eat when they are upset. It may help to talk to someone we trust andget professional supportif we need it. If you have ever felt lonely, you will know how much it helps to have even a small connection with someone else. Exchanging a smile or friendly words can be comforting and lift our mood. Research shows thatbeing kindis good for both sides. Being kind can boost our mood, help us feel more capable, strengthen our connections with others and even make us cope better with stress. If you don’t know where to start, you could try small but meaningful acts of kindness, such as offering a smile or a few kind words to another person. You could make their day but also feel better for it -friendly connections with others are vital for our mental health. More inspiration about acts of kindness We can also help others by doing volunteer work and getting together with other people to work for good causes. These things can help us feel connected with others and the world around us. It can give us the sense that we can make a difference. All of this is good for our mental health. We can all get stuck in familiar ways, like how we spend our time and what we think about ourselves and the world. This can be self-fulfilling, with our expectations influencing what actually happens, for good or bad. For example, we might say to ourselves: “Things never get better” or “I’m useless” as a response to what others have said to us. It can help to notice these thoughts and try out new ones, such as “I can change things for the better” and “there is so much I can do”. Life can feel more interesting, lively and rewarding when we are open to trying new experiences and experimenting with how we do things. It could be as simple as what we have for breakfast or the route we walk with the dog. It could also need some planning, like an adventure holiday. We might find a new place that it turns out we love, discover a talent we didn’t know we had or meet someone new and important. Life throws all sorts at us, and during hard times, we may feel hopeless and not have the energy to plan for the future. Things to look forward to, including fun activities, can help us cope with difficult situations. Making plans for things we enjoy can increase our sense of hope, which is important for our mental health. Our plan could be for anything from small pleasures, like a cup of tea or your favourite TV programme or dance class, to a trip with family or friends, or seeing your favourite film, sports team or singer. Whether it’s a small or a big one, the important thing is to plan it. Decide what you’ll do, when and with who and, if needed, book it. It’s important to follow your plan – and repeat. Feeling very upset can interfere with our lives, making it hard to think clearly or work, relax, study, sleep or deal with other people. Many of us will know when we’re upset but not be sure what we’re feeling. Is it sadness,fear, shame,loneliness, anger or something else? We don’t always know why we’re feeling that way. It often helps to give our feelings our attention without judging them, without telling ourselves we’re stupid or weak to feel the way we do. It may seem strange and uncomfortable to do this. But practice and patience with ourselves will help. Naming what we’re feeling is also likely to help. So, we can say to ourselves: “I’m feeling really irritable today but also sad.” Another helpful step can be to work out what has led to us feeling this way – might it be a disagreement or disappointment that you’ve had? Some women might find that their periods sometimes (or always) affect their moods. Talking kindly to ourselves, in the same way, we might reassure a small child we care about, is also important. It can be very comforting. You might feel uncomfortable initially, but give it a go – it might just help. Some people feel better if they write down their feelings in a notebook or on their phone. You might want to think about how to protect your privacy before doing this. You could try repeating something positive about yourself a few times each day. (This is sometimes called a “mantra”. “I am on a journey, growing and developing”, for example.) Research shows this reduces negative thoughts and feelings. Some people also feel that an activity called “mindfulness” is helpful. Talking with someone else can also be helpful – and that’s our next suggestion… Get more tips by reading our tips: How to understand and manage your emotions  Many of us have learned to bottle things up inside us and try to ignore painful feelings. It can take a lot of courage to tell someone else how we’re feeling or what we’re finding hard, especially if we don’t usually do that kind of thing. Justtalking things through with a person we trustcan help and feel like a relief. Use your own words. It’ll make you feel safer and less alone, and that will help protect your mental health and prevent problems. Talking may also change how you see and feel about the situation in ways you find helpful. Another possible benefit is that talking may strengthen your relationship with the person you speak with. This will benefit both of you and make it easier for them to turn to you when they need support themselves. Information about talking with friends about your mental health Information about talking with a health professional about how you’re feeling Many of us sometimes use drugs to block out “difficult” feelings such as sadness, fear or shame. No one wants to feel bad; for some people,drugsand/oralcoholoffer temporary relief. Unfortunately, they don’t stop the feelings from returning and may make things worse or create other problems, including damage to mental and physical health, relationships, work, or study. If you think you may be using drugs or alcohol to cope with difficult feelings, it may help to notice it without beating yourself up about it. Being understanding and kind to yourself is good for your mental health. A possible next step could be to talk with someone you trust or one of the charities that offer confidential, free information and advice, including how to reduce the harmfulness of using drugs. Have a look atTalk To Frank, for example. You could also look for other ways of coping with painful feelings, such as getting help with the situation causing them, if possible, and finding a trusted person to talk with. This could be a friend or relative, a colleague, a person working for a charity helpline, your GP or a counsellor. Many charities around the country offerlow-cost or free therapy. Find more detailed information aboutgetting help with your mental healthfrom many potential sources. Some people find it helps to go to “anonymous” meetings, such asNarcotics Anonymous, to share with others who have/had similar experiences. Some of these meetings are also now online. Money problems can be unavoidable, and we may have no choice about being in debt. Fears about payingdebts, bills and essentials such as food and electricity can be very stressful. If we feel responsible for sending money back home or are the only earner in our household, we may feel burdened and isolated. Feelings like this can make it harder to cope with everything, including the money problems themselves. There are things we can do to help prevent financial problems causing issues with our mental health. We might feel ashamed of what we’re going through, which may make it harder to tell anyone, leaving us feeling alone with it. The truth is, we’re never alone with money problems. Research shows they are one of the most common and serious sources of stress for many people. Even if our finances are impossible to change, sharing our fears with another person who’s not involved and who you trust is likely to help us feel less alone and overwhelmed. This may help us to see new ways forward. If we are struggling financially, including with debt, it can be helpful to talk about it with an expert at a charity that offers free money advice. They are very experienced with what can go wrong with people’s finances and what may help. It can be really helpful to ask for help before any debt becomes unmanageable. But getting help will benefit everyone. Here is a list of organisations that offer free advice about financial problems, created by the charity Money and Mental Health. Talking with one of these free, expert advisers could also lead to you finding out about new possibilities, such as benefits you’re entitled to, your legal rights, ways to reduce the size of your debt repayments and other ways to save money.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/surviving-or-thriving-state-uks-mental-health,Surviving or Thriving? The state of the UK's mental health,"We all have mental health. Good mental health is an asset that helps us to thrive. This is not just the absence of a mental health problem, but having the ability to think, feel and act in a way that allows us to enjoy life and deal with the challenges it presents. Yet it can be easy to assume that ongoing stress is the price we have to pay to keep our lives on track. It is time to challenge that assumption. In March 2017, commissioned by the Mental Health Foundation, NatCen conducted a survey amongst its panel members in England, Scotland and Wales. This aimed to understand the prevalence of self-reported mental health problems, levels of positive and negative mental health in the population, and the actions people take to deal with the stressors in their lives. 2,290 interviews were completed, with 82% online and 18% by phone.  As this report sets out, some people and communities are at greater risk of living with negative mental health and/or with mental health problems. However, no one is immune from developing problems and there are steps we can all take to understand, protect and sustain good mental health. In much the same way as it is now accepted that people should seek to maintain good physical health, we all need to acknowledge the importance of acting to support good mental health for ourselves and for those around us. There are steps we can all take to support our own mental health and the mental health of our friends, family and neighbours. However, there is also much that is beyond our control. Significant responsibility lies with the governments across the UK at national and city level to protect and improve mental health for all.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/taking-sleep-seriously,Taking Sleep Seriously: Sleep and our mental health,"Sleepis integral to all aspects of our lives, yet sleep is often one of the first things we compromise when things become busy or overwhelming. Often our lives and daily routines, schools, workplaces and home or community environments are not structured in ways that value and prioritise the importance of good sleep. Sleep is a critical component of not just our physical health, but our mental health. In March 2020, the Mental Health Foundation commissioned two surveys on sleep and mental health from1YouGov: one of 4437 UK adults aged 18+2and another of 2412 GB teenagers aged 13 to 19.3In our surveys, nearly half (48%) of adults and two-thirds of teenagers (66%) agreed that sleeping badly has a negative effect on their mental health. Increased awareness of the importance of sleep and systemic action on sleep should be a priority. Taking sleep seriously and understanding the many ways sleep interacts with our lives can help us harness its potential as a powerful way to promote and protect good mental health for all. Sleep problems can be both a symptom of and a contributor to mental health problems. Treatment for sleep problems can help improve mental health. There is some evidence that treating sleep problems may help reduce depression symptoms in the general population, suggesting it may be an avenue for preventative mental health care. Parents (particularly mothers) of young children experience significant changes to the quality and quantity of their sleep which can affect parental mental health and contribute to stress in families. Bedtime routines can help to build good sleep habits in children from an early age. Adolescents’ routines, including school schedules, may affect the amount of sleep they get, which has implications for their mental health. School-based sleep education programmes can be used to increase student knowledge about the importance of sleep and how to develop healthy sleep habits. The characteristics of a workplace affect our sleep and our mental health. In our survey, 37% of working adults reported that their work (for example, workload, problems with colleagues and worries about job security) reduces the amount of control they feel they have over their sleep. Employers should ensure they support good sleep and good mental health at work by promoting a choice of shift, offering healthy sleep programmes to staff, promoting a good work-life balance and consulting experts and worker representatives to develop flexible work schedules. There are inequalities in the quality and quantity of our sleep linked to our environment, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, financial stability and experiences of trauma. In our survey, a quarter (25%) of UK adults reported that worrying about money matters, including bills, negatively affected their sleep in the past month. Of those who were unemployed, more than a quarter (27%) reported experiencing suicidal thoughts and feelings due to a lack of sleep. Governments across the UK must incorporate sleep (including the prevention and treatment of sleep problems) into their mental health and wellbeing strategies – sleep is fundamental to good mental and physical health. UK Research Councils must work with UK partners to fund research to better understand the role of sleep as a central determinant of health and wellbeing, and of directly addressing poor sleep as a central component of mental health. While there are changes that can be made at a societal level to better recognise and prioritise sleep, there are also things each of us can start to work on today, as individuals, to support our own sleep and mental health. Professor Colin Espie, Professor of Sleep Medicine at the University of Oxford, shared with MHF five principles for good sleep health, which are that we should: 1Total sample size was 4246 adults.

Julie designed her 'Sleep Well' garden for theRHS Flower Showwhile she was on sick leave recovering from surgery. The garden was inspired by the importance ofsleep, looking after your well-being, andgreen space for sustaining good mental health. We asked Julie what green space does for her own mental health: ""I know that if I get home from work and feel overcome by the day... I know that by going to my allotment and getting my trowel in the soil and watching the robin join me, I'll find myself talking to the robin and looking at the plants and thinking what does it all matter, because no matter what is happening in the outside world, things will keep growing here."" Antonis Kousoulis, Associate Director of Research and Development and Linda Liao, Digital Manager at The Mental Health Foundation have a discussion with Bethan later in the podcast abouttips for getting good sleep, andhow to incorporate green space into your routineto help look after your mental health.

The Mental Health Foundation is touring London boroughs talking about what would support local communities to thrive. It is part of our work with Thrive LDN, a partnership between local government and health, aiming to improve the health and happiness of people living in the city. Since Mayor of London Sadiq Khan launched Thrive LDN last July the Foundation has led on organising and delivering community workshops in 16 of the capital’s 32 boroughs. By the end of the programme we will have had direct conversations with about 1,000 Londoners. We have made a short film about this work you can watch here. In each workshop we explain what Thrive LDN is hoping to achieve, set out the Foundation evidence for what helps communities thrive and hear what the local challenges and current work includes. We then conduct table-based workshops where everyone attending gives us their ideas on how to locally deliver Thrive LDN’s six aspirations: The written feed-back is sent to all the participants with actions for local people and their services. Over the coming weeks we will be putting together everything we have heard and analysing it for common themes and ideas. The resulting report, giving a voice to a large and representative group of Londoners, will help inform policy at a local, regional and national level. Already we are using the feedback to create the Thrive Communities pilot programme of support for three London housing estates in areas of high need. We can use the learning from this programme to make further suggestions on how to better support communities live healthier and happier lives. Although based in London this learning is relevant to other parts of the country and we are looking to build on it across the UK.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/londoners-did,Londoners did,"Location:England An analysis of the outcomes of theThrive LDN Londoners said community conversations, with a foreword from the Mayor of London. Poor mental health is one of the biggest challenges facing London and prevalence is often much higher inthe communities facing greater inequalities. In July 2017, the Mayor of London, alongside health and care partners, launched Thrive LDN with the aim of creating a collective movement across London, supporting everyone to speak openly about mental health and have an equal opportunity to thrive. Following this, in September 2018, the Mayor further demonstrated his commitment to improving the mental health of Londoners through the publication of hisHealth Inequalities Strategy, which Thrive LDN supports the delivery of. At its core, Thrive LDN is a participation-driven partnership that engages with and responds to the needs and insights of Londoners. By working in partnership across London we are better able to achieve our shared goal for all Londoners to have an equal chance to a healthy, happy and fulfilling life. This ‘Londoners did’ report forms part of the story of how this partnership of Londoners is delivering real change in their communities. The report sets out how recommendations from the Thrive LDN community conversations presented inthe‘Londonerssaid’ reporthave been put into practice. During 2017/18, more than 1000 Londoners took part in 17 community conversations across half of the city’s boroughs and their ideas for implementing the six Thrive LDN aspirations in their communities were recorded and shared with the ambition that action would follow. Find out more about Thrive LDN This report shows that action did indeed follow from the community conversations in the form of better relationships between people and institutions, the development of a network of champions, new job roles, and volunteering opportunities. It also changed local plans and strategies and even brought together public health and planning teams around the design of a new leisure centre to ensure high quality community space. Given the first of the six Thrive LDN aspirations is to foster ‘a city where individuals and communities take control’, it is heartening that around 400 people developed useful relationships which are fundamental to change. The community conversations called for a network of Thrive LDN Champions and in themselves the events provided a recruitment tool that led to champions being signed up and trained to lead positive change in their communities. Whilst there are a number of tangible examples of change, it is less easy to measure advances made through the momentum generated, which many of the community conversation participants report was a positive outcome of the conversations. In follow-up interviews, two organisers said that the community conversation had led to or supported the creation of new job roles, including a public mental health specialist position and a voluntary sector liaison manager. Whilst in Lewisham, for example, the community conversation had aided reaching out to the Black community to support improving mental health services and public health. In Hackney, the momentum and ideas led to a developing series of support information resources for people facing major life changes, such as births, bereavement and marriage, which the evidence suggests can make people more vulnerable to mental ill health. These resources are in development and registrars have been identified as potential conduits of this information, as they interact with people at these pivotal points. In Enfield, the community conversation influenced the plans for a major regeneration - prompting greater focus on creating ‘mentally healthier’ places with better access to green and community space, whilst in Sutton the community conversation fed into a Fairness Commission. In another borough, a Poverty Commission was prompted by the community conversation to place a greater emphasis on security, that is security of housing tenure, security of employment and personal security. In some boroughs, organisers said the community conversation was a revelation in terms of the approach to working with local residents and led to the adoption of more co-production as a means of developing other areas of public health work.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/londoners-said,Londoners said,"Location:England Poor mental health is one of the biggest challenges facing London and the prevalence of problems is often much higher in the communities facing mostinequalities. When people aren't given the chance to fulfil their potential and they don’t receive the right support at the right time, their health suffers, and they struggle to thrive. London loses out. To address this, the Mental Health Foundation, in partnership with Thrive LDN, went out and asked Londoners how we could better support people to be mentally healthy. We did this through 17 community conversations in half of all London’s boroughs, where we had face-to-face contact with over 1000 Londoners, including those who commission, provide and use services. We asked how we could deliver Thrive LDN’s six aspirations. The solutions those Londoners came up with share common themes – namely, to spread knowledge, skills and support so that people can better look after themselves and their neighbours. Londoners have told us they don’t want or need top-down fixes – instead, they want the tools and networks to do it for themselves. This report provides insights and feedback from each of the community conversations held. Recommendations have been developed for all partners and supporters of Thrive LDN to consider. We would welcome your feedback and response to the ideas set out below. Thrive LDN is a citywide movement to improve the mental health and wellbeing of all Londoners. It is supported by the Mayor of London and led by the London Health Board partners. Two million Londoners experience some form of poor mental health every year and Londoners' life satisfaction and feelings of self-worth are lower than the national average. Thrive LDN was established in response to this, with the aim of reducing the number of Londoners affected by poor mental health.

Around 1 in 3 adults in England report having experienced at least one traumatic event. Traumatic events can be defined as experiences that put either a person or someone close to them at risk of serious harm or death. These can include: When you experience a traumatic event, your body’s defences take effect and create a stress response, which may make you feel a variety of physical symptoms, behave differently and experience more intense emotions. This fight or flight response, where your body produces chemicals which prepare your body for an emergency, can lead to symptoms such as: This is normal, as it’s your body’s evolutionary way of responding to an emergency, making it easier for you to fight or run away. Directly after the event, people may also experience shock and denial. This can give way over several hours or days, to a range of other feelings such as sadness, anger and guilt. Many people feel better and recover gradually. However, if these feelings persist, they can lead to more serious mental health problems, such aspost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)anddepression. It can be difficult to talk to close family or friends after a traumatic event. You may not want to cause them any distress or may simply want some space to process it all. However, it is important to be around other people when you feel able to, as they can help with your recovery and wellbeing. You do not have to talk to them about the experience. If you don’t have anyone close by to talk to, you can contact one of the organisations listed in the guide who will be able to offer further help. It is important to look after your health and wellbeing. This can include taking a break or some time away to deal with your experience. You should also try and keep ahealthy dietand stay away from drugs andalcohol, which can exacerbate the problem. If you are experiencing symptoms that are affecting your day to day life, it is important to get professional help as soon as possible so you can begin to get better. You should consider seeking help if: The first person to approach is your family doctor orGP. He or she should be able to give advice about treatment, and may refer you to another local professional. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a condition you may develop after experiencing a traumatic or life-threatening event. We all have times when we feel down, but depression is about more than feeling sad or fed up for a few days. Depression causes a low mood that lasts a long time and affects your daily life.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/state-generation-upheaval-uncertainty-change,"State of a Generation: Upheaval, uncertainty and change","As part of the Mental Health Foundation’s 70th anniversary, we commissioned a series of reports, each looking at some key factors that can challenge and support our mental health at different stages of life. This is the second of these reports, focused on what has traditionally been referred to as ‘working-age adulthood’. It is intended asan exploration of a selection of life transitions which can have a profound effect on our mental health, and a call to action for how we can better protect and promote good mental health in the context of these life experiences. We selected four life transitions –pregnancy and early parenthood, unemployment and job loss, moving home and housing problems, and bereavementto investigate in-depth. We recognise that there will be many other experiences in adulthood that are equally as impactful, however we believe there are lessons to be learned from these four which translate across many different types of life transitions. They are significant because they represent key moments of upheaval, uncertainty, and change which many of us will encounter during this period of our lives. They have also become more salient in the context of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. We worked in partnership with Citizens Advice Wandsworth, Pregnancy Sickness Support, The Motherhood Group, and Cruse Bereavement Support to hold online discussions with people who have experienced each of these life events. We also worked with the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders group at York University to review the existing academic research on what works to support mental health across each of these experiences and brought this together with nationally representative polling of 3,879 UK adults aged 18-64 from Deltapoll. Despite on the surface being very different experiences, we found several common themes across pregnancy and early parenthood, unemployment and job loss, moving home, and bereavement in terms of howmoments of transition in adulthood are often accompanied by feelings of worry, lack of control, and uncertainty. These feelings are natural responses to change but can also be distressingand can adversely affect our mental health, particularly when we do not have the social and formal support we need at such times. Our polling found that while most of us did feel supported during these times in our lives, a substantial minority of UK adults did not benefit from any type of formal, or informal, support during their own experience of these life events, particularly those from the lowest income households. This is crucial becauseacross all four themes, social support from family and friends, and support from voluntary and outreach services (such as peer support and advice lines) were central in helping people to navigate these times of transition in their lives. All of us need a basic level of support during times of transition and uncertainty, which recognises each of us as individuals, and helps to build our capacity to navigate change. For many (though not all) of us, this will come from our families, friends, and communities; however, some of us may need additional help from more formal sources.Ensuring this range of culturally appropriate universal and targeted support is available is crucial to promoting and protecting mental health during life transitions experienced in adulthood.For this reason, we want to see – at national and local levels - a whole-government approach to addressing the issues that protect and pose a risk to our mental health, which should include: Read our methodology report This report, 'State of a Generation: Preventing mental health problems in children and young people' focuses on childhood and young adulthood as a particularly important time for development and mental health.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, weconnected with naturein new and surprising ways. Many of us found comfort in the longer days of spring and felt hope as we watched nature come to life around us. Many of us are wondering what the future holds. Now more than ever we need to make the most ofnature’s healing powers. Although research1suggests that 120 minutes might be the optimal amount of time to spend in nature a week, this can be made up of short spells – and we should prioritise quality over quantity. Making a deep emotional connection2with nature is more beneficial than exposure alone. And even if you can’t get outside, there are ways to bring the outside in, through creativity and community. In the crazy world of today, when the human race seems so little able to control its destiny, when crises and depressions follow each other in mad succession, the need for escape is more urgent and the call of wild places more insistent than ever.- Wild Chorus, Peter Scott 1938, P1 If you’ve ever visited WWT wetland sites, or even your local river or pond, you’ll know there’s something special about water, with its power to inspire and calm us. Wetlands are uplifting places to visit in autumn and winter, when they come to life with migratory birds. There is some early evidence that people prefer landscapes with blue spaces3, and these might bring greater wellbeing benefits than green space alone. These benefits include improving how you are feeling, reducing both negative thoughts and levels ofstress.4, 5 I seem to connect with a different bird each time I visit. Whenever I have the time to just stand and watch as they preen or swim or feed. I am often in awe of the power of the swans.- From phone interviews with a member Everyone is different – you may find certain methods create a greater connection for you than others. Find your thing and explore it! ""Man needs nature for his spiritual wellbeing as well as his material wellbeing.""- Sir Peter Scott, WWT founder  As winter arrives and everything else goes quiet there are spectacular, wide-open spaces in which to enjoy a shimmering sunset reflected on the water, or get a dose of fresh air while you watch birds splashing. You might even be lucky enough to spot a rare water vole swimming secretively through the reeds. In winter, we can have less energy and some people experienceSeasonal Affective Disorderwith symptoms ofdepressionthat come and go according to the seasons. Although it might be difficult, the extra effort to keep in touch with nature during the winter can positively impact our mental health and lift our spirits. Here are some ideas to inspire you to get outsides and experience wetlands in the autumn and winter: ""The thrill of watching wild geese at such close quarters is most easily appreciated by those who have previous experience of their proverbial wariness, but even those who have never seen geese before cannot fail to be stirred by such an intimate view of these magnificent birds.""- First booklet of the Wildfowl Trust, Peter Scott, 1948 (Re-printed in “Collected Writings” P71)  Created byWWTin partnership with the Mental Health Foundation.

Included in this booklet are tips on how to cope with injuries, how to manage uncertainties and disappointment and suggestions of healthy strategies to cope withstressesthat arise from sport and life in general and build resilience. This booklet aims to give the reader the knowledge and freedom to look after themselves and feel good about it. Being an elite athlete has many positives, including keeping fit and active which can lead to many physical benefits. Additionally, this is coupled with the enjoyment and purpose of playing your favourite sport, camaraderie and friendship, and the loyalty and togetherness you can get from your team or club. Being in a performance environment also brings some pressure and stress, some are positive like building resilience, improving performance and work rate. However, there can also be negative effects as well where too much stress is unhealthy and can lead to different physical, emotional and mental challenges. Dedicated athletes experience similar rates ofanxiety,depressionandsleep disordersto the general population, but there is increasing evidence pointing to a range of specific wellbeing issues athletes might face at all ages and stages of participation. Other factors such as specific injuries like concussion, major negative life events such as a familybereavement, poor support networks and impaired sleep can all impact wellbeing and mental health. We also found that extended travel away from home and exposure to unfamiliar (training) environments can take its toll. Transitioning out of sport (which includes involuntary or unplanned retirement) can also have a significant impact on personal identity.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/cool-down,Cool Down: Anger and how to deal with it,"When was the last time you really lost it? Was it when your child ran across the road and narrowly missed being run down? Or when someone elbowed you out of the way to get on the bus? Or was it when you were rejected for a job you thought you deserved to get? “I get this bubble of rage. I go wild. I feel like crying cos I don’t know how to control myself. It happens too quickly.” We all feel angry at times and it’s a natural response to threats and attacks, injustice and disappointment. Anger is a powerful emotion and releasing the pressure that builds inside you is often essential to let you deal with problems and move on. But if anger isn’t dealt with in a healthy way, it can have a significant effect on your daily life, relationships, achievements and mental wellbeing. This booklet outlines how anger works and explains the benefits of keeping your anger level under control or expressing it in a constructive way. It also describes some of the tactics you can use to manage your anger more effectively and minimise the personal costs of times when anger gets the better of you. Anger is one of the most basic human emotions. It is a physical and mental response to a threat or to harm done in the past. Anger takes many different forms from irritation to blinding rage or resentment that festers over many years. At any point in time, a combination of physical, mental and social factors interact to make us feel a certain way. It’s different for each of us. Our feelings are influenced by our emotional make-up, how we view the world, what happens around us and our circumstances. Like other emotions, anger rarely acts alone. As we go about our lives, we’re constantly weighing up situations and deciding what we think about them: good or bad, safe or unsafe etc. How we interpret a situation influences how we feel about it. If we think a situation means ‘you are in danger’, we feel afraid. If it means ‘you have been wronged’, we feel angry. And these feelings determine how we react to the situation. We translate meanings into feelings very fast. With anger, that speed sometimes means that we react in ways we later regret. From the moment we are born, we are observing events, giving them meanings and making associations between them. From our experience we learn to size up each situation. That decides which emotion influences what we do next. Many of our emotions are linked to a particular physical response. Anger gets the mind and body ready for action. It arouses the nervous system, increasing the heart rate, blood pressure, blood flow to muscles, blood sugar level and sweating. It also sharpens the senses and increases the production of adrenalin, a hormone produced at times of stress. ""My heart was racing, I was physically tense, I was gobsmacked.” At the same time as these physical changes, anger is thought to affect the way we think. When we are first faced with a threat, anger helps us quickly translate complex information into simple terms: ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ for instance. This can be useful in an emergency as we don’t waste valuable time weighing up information that doesn’t instantly affect our safety or wellbeing. But it can mean that we act before we’ve considered what else is relevant and made a rational decision about how to behave. It may be that we need to take more time to look at the situation and deal with it differently. When anger gets in the way of rational thinking we may give way to the urge to act aggressively, propelled by the instinct to survive or protect someone from a threat. The situations that trigger anger today are much the same as those faced by our ancestors. They include: “My ex drives way too close behind me. Hasn’t she heard of safe stopping distances? One of these days someone’s going to get killed.” “If your integrity is questioned that touches something very deep.” ""I get very angry at global issues like the use of the death penalty, oppressive regimes and poverty.” “My phone company hacks me off . They don’t listen, they don’t care: customer service my foot!” Whether or not we feel someone has wronged us on purpose is a crucial factor in whether we become angry. Our recent experience can also influence our reactions. If you’re having a bad day and are in a state of constant tension, you’re more likely to snap when the fifth thing in a row goes wrong, even if it’s something that wouldn’t usually bother you. We may feel angry immediately or only feel angry later as we recall a situation. Anger that comes to the surface years later sometimes has its roots in abuse or neglect long ago. Sometimes anger hangs around inside us for decades because it wasn’t dealt with sufficiently at the time. “Since my dad died, I’ve found out that there are things my mum had never learnt to do. I get angry with myself that I can’t find a different way of explaining to her things like how to change the timer on the boiler. I may sound impatient with her, but really I’m impatient with myself.” “I don’t feel so angry now I’m older. I’ve accepted how the world is.” “When someone physically threatened my daughter when she was a newborn I exploded. I got a real physical sense of something being different that I haven’t experienced before or since."" Faced with the same situation, some people will feel angry and others will not. Some will show their anger, in a variety of ways, while others will keep their anger to themselves. As well as differences between the ways that individuals react to trigger situations, people’s responses can vary according to their gender, age, ethnicity, religion, social position or family history. The expectations of the people close to us or of society in general can influence how we act. For example, some people think it less acceptable for women to raise their voice in anger than for men to do the same. That may be why women tend to internalise their anger more than men, turning it in on themselves rather than letting it out in words or actions. Throughout our lives we get used to behaving in set ways in reaction to certain situations. These ‘learnt behaviours’ can form a pattern which is sometimes hard to break. The way that parents behave when they are angry can influence how their children deal with anger throughout their lives so it’s important that parents set a good example. Anger isn’t always negative. It can be a force for good. Moral outrage can drive people to campaign for change, right wrongs and enforce the rules that govern our society. People often think of anger and aggression as the same thing, but researchers estimate that people get aggressive just 10% of the times that they get angry. Anger is an emotional state and aggression is just one of the ways that people behave when they are angry. Aggressive behaviour can be physical or verbal and gives the signal that someone intends to cause harm. It can mean people become violent towards others or throw things. Aggression often takes over when people act on their instinct to protect themselves or others. Alcohol can make some people act more aggressively and drug use can similarly lower our inhibitions. People often express their anger verbally. They may shout, threaten, use dramatic words, bombard someone with hostile questions or exaggerate the impact on them of someone else’s action. Some people who are angry get their own back indirectly by acting the martyr. They get their own way by making other people feel guilty and playing on that guilt. Others develop a cynical attitude and constantly criticise everything, but never address problems constructively. Some people internalise their anger. They may be seething inside and may physically shake, but they don’t show their anger in the way they behave when they are around other people. People who internalise their anger may self-harm when they are angry because they find it hard to deal with their emotions. They deliberately harm themselves, usually in secret, as a way of coping with intense feelings they can’t express another way. Self-harm is most common among young people. They may feel it gives them a release from their anger, but any relief is only temporary and, like many more obvious ways of expressing anger, self-harming doesn’t solve problems long term. Anger in itself is neither good nor bad, but it becomes a problem when it harms us or other people. Anger is the emotion most likely to cause problems in relationships in the family, at work and with friends. People with a long term anger problem tend to be poor at making decisions, take more risks than other people and are more likely to have a substance misuse problem. Long term and intense anger has been linked with mental health problems includingdepression,anxietyandself-harm. It is also linked to poorer overall physical health as well as particular conditions from high blood pressure, colds and flu to coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer and gastro-intestinal problems. Reports show that anger problems are as common as depression and anxiety, but people experiencing difficulties with anger often fail to identify their anger or see it as a problem. They rarely seek support and may be more likely to see other people as the problem. If a member of their family or colleagues persuade them to seek help, they may be less willing to take on board any advice they are given than if they had asked for support themselves. Changing how you behave takes eff ort and can be made easier by the support of family and friends. “If I could have expressed my anger more openly and constructively it would have been less damaging to me. Otherwise you carry the hurt with you.” Most people get angry quite often, but their anger is within a normal and healthy range. Other people experience anger frequently and intensely enough for it to interfere with their everyday life. Both sets of people can benefit from learning how to deal with their anger more effectively. There’s lots of evidence to suggest that managing your anger in a healthy way can help people look after their mental and physical health, feel more positive about themselves, achieve their goals, solve problems and enjoy relationships with the people around them. Anger can lead you to action, or even violence, you will regret. Keeping your temper under control can also save you from yourself, helping you to avoid the trouble or humiliation that may follow an outburst. Bottling up your anger for a long time isn’t a good thing either. It’s important to deal with anger and move on, not let it stew inside you. When you feel the first surge of anger boiling up inside you, pause for a moment. Think about what has made you angry, think about the consequences of exploding in a rage and then choose how to respond. Delaying your reaction can make all the difference between blowing your top and dealing with the situation calmly and constructively. Even in the middle of an argument, it’s not too late to take a deep breath and choose to express your feelings differently. Give rational thinking time to kick in. ""Now I play the drums. It’s a very good way of dealing with my anger. When I feel worked up, I think ‘I’m just going to pound something for a few hours.’ It works really quickly. It takes my mind off it and then I just enjoy playing.” There are other activities which may help you almost immediately, later the same day or if you make them part of your lifestyle longer term: Being assertive is a healthier way to express anger than aggression. Before you allow yourself to flare up, put yourself into another gear and take ownership of your feelings. ""If you keep shouting, people will stop listening.” Assertiveness training tends to be aimed at people who find it hard to speak up for themselves, not at people who may need to convert their aggression to assertiveness. Self-help guidance may give you useful tips on assertive communication and body language. “I managed to talk to her later and that completely cleared the air.” Good communication skills can help you get your message across. Keep the lines of communication open. Listen to other people’s point of view. Assuming you know where they stand can create a problem where there is none and escalate a situation from bad to worse.

Longer term, it can be really helpful to work out what makes you angry and how it makes you behave. Think about it when you’re not feeling angry. Talk it through with someone who you trust and who knows you well. “Now I can control it. I just think ‘For goodness sake’. I recognise the situation for what it is."" Being good at solving problems can help you avoid feeling like a victim when something doesn’t go well. Some problems are beyond your power to change. If you accept that, you can concentrate on working out what you can change. For instance, you could give yourself more time to complete tasks when you expect they’ll be frustrating. Feeling stressed out makes us more likely to lose our temper and people in good mental health are better able to cope when things go wrong. Being on the receiving end of anger or just being a witness to it can be tough. Many people put up with regular displays of anger from people close to them because they love them, fear them or feel that they deserve no better. But if other people’s anger is really getting you down, you shouldn’t have to put up with it. Anger tends to be catching, but staying calm yourself can help both of you. If you get angry as well, things can quickly escalate. It’s easy to absorb other people’s negativity so it’s often useful to take yourself away from an angry person. Give them time to cool down, wait a few minutes, then talk with them when they seem less agitated and may be more able to look at the situation neutrally. No-one needs to put up with violence. The advice in this booklet can’t help you to deal with violence so if you are afraid or feel threatened you should ask for help – see the helplines listed on the last page. If you have been assaulted, call the police. If you are worried about anger or another aspect of your mental health and want advice on what to do, your GP is a good place to start. Your GP may suggest ways you can manage your anger yourself or they may refer you to another service for further support. You may have to join a waiting list for further support on the NHS and so some people choose to arrange and pay for support themselves. Talking therapiessuch as counselling orCBT (cognitive behavioural therapy)can help people explore what makes them angry, work out why anger has become a problem for them and learn how to change the way they respond to the situations that typically make them angry.Talking therapiesare usually provided over a course of several weeks or months. Anger management coursesoften involve counselling and group work with other people with similar problems. The courses take place either over a day or a weekend or in sessions over a period of weeks. Domestic violence programmeshelp people whose anger leads them to violence against members of their family. They usually help people take responsibility for their actions and understand their impact on those close to them. They may also ask people to change other parts of their life such as addressing any problems with alcohol or drugs. Local support groupscan be a way for people with a problem in common to share their experiences and support and encourage each other to change their behaviour. They may be led by someone who has themselves had a problem with anger in the past. Faith leadersor others of the same community can help people reflect and get perspective on a situation that has made them angry. They will help set the situation in the context of the values that the faith follows. TheBritish Association of Anger Managementruns weekend and evening courses for people who want help dealing with their own anger and for people who work with those who have difficulties with their anger. “Anger management really works, but you have to practise.” Talking therapies provided on the NHS are given by trained professionals, but you should check that any independent therapist you approach is registered with one of these organisations: Counselling fromRelatecan help people talk through relationship difficulties, whether they are married, living together, in a same-sex relationship, separated, divorced or single.

Good relationships protect our mental health and wellbeing at any stage of life. People who are more socially connected are happier, physically healthier and live longer. Lonelinesscan be toxic to our wellbeing – our health declines earlier and we can have shorter lifespans. It’s important to remember that it isgood, supportive relationshipsthat protect our bodies and our minds. This guide will outline what each of us can do to create better relationships with ourselves, with the people we are close to and with those around us. “The relationship with yourself sets the tone for every other relationship you have.” Robert Holden Try this exercise: imagine being in a relationship with someone you didn’t love, found to be deeply flawed, worthless and not good enough. Now imagine you have to be in this relationship for the rest of your life. How would that relationship feel? How would that relationship affect your thoughts, behaviour and day-to-day life? It’s important to evaluate the relationship you have with yourself. Ask yourself: would you speak to someone else the way you speak about yourself? “Caring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation.” Audre Lorde Self-care is about looking after yourself and your mental health. The relationship you have with yourself is crucial to your own wellbeing and also to creating healthy and happy relationships with others.Being kind to yourselfregularly is one of the best things you can do for yourself. Self-care can look like different things for different people. For some, self-care might be taking time to rest each week; for others, it may be sweating it out at the gym or going for a run outside. Self-care could be going for a walk in one’s neighbourhood, spending time in nature, or seeing or speaking to friends regularly. Here are a few habits you can start today that can bring about a positive change to improving the relationship you have with yourself: Healthy relationshipsshould allow both people in the relationship to feel supported and connected, but also allow each person to maintain their independence. Communication and setting boundaries are two important components of a healthy relationship. The following traits are often described as being present in healthy relationships: It is the quality of your relationship(s) that is key to maintaining your health and happiness more than the number of relationships you have. It’s better to have a few close friends who you can speak to if something is bothering you than have many acquaintances.Tips for creating and maintaining good, healthy relationshipsin life are universal. The following tips and suggestions can help improve the relationships you have with those around you: The following section looks at what you can do to stay connected and maintain positive healthy relationships with other people across different place settings. The school environment plays a critical role in the social development of its students. Teachers can work together with students in a number of ways to avoid isolating classmates: Student mental healthis an important issue to address in higher education. Having student peers and maintaining good social networks throughout the university years protects against mental health problems and fosters positive mental health during stressful periods. Moreover, the support students receive from family and friends helps them remain in higher education, which is important, as having a higher education is a predictor of social connectedness across life into later years. The‘Look After Your Mate’ guide(produced by Student Minds) supports you in looking out for your friends throughout their student years. Some of their useful tips are shared below. The workplace presents a number of opportunities for people to develop their social networks. This can be through work itself, through leisure activities or through shared interests, such as sport and the arts. Approaches that increase employee health and wellbeing are also likely to influence and impact relationships in the workplace. Typically, workplace wellbeing programmes and approaches focus on individuals by targeting things likehealthier eating,physical exercise,smokingcessation andstressmanagement. While these programmes have shown positive and cost-effective outcomes for individuals, it is also crucial that workplace wellbeing takes a whole-workplace approach by addressing the working environment factors (social and physical) that impact health and wellbeing. Programmes should include: It’s important that any approaches or interventions an organisation invests in are available to all and that everyone is made aware of the opportunities through good communication. Interventions should be tailored to reach employees who may have more difficulty accessing these, such as those in part-time work, working night shifts or on short-term contracts. Not everyone will be equally able to access programmes, therefore – although approaches should be universally available – they need also to focus and place priority on those most at risk of developing mental health problems. In addition, views and feedback from employees should be sought to ensure that any approaches taken to improve mental health and wellbeing are effective and demonstrate that employee needs have been considered. This serves to further engage and empower employees within an organisation For good practice examples of interventions that improve the health and wellbeing of staff and employees, see GOV.UK’s report: ‘Local action on health inequalities: Increasing employment opportunities and improving workplace health’. As a manager: Both co-workers and managers should: We also have a guide on supporting good mental health at work Some things that you can do to help strengthen community connections in your neighbourhood include: The internet has enabled us to make friends with people we don’t know and may never meet in real life. For instance, Facebook has allowed us to create and maintain ‘friendships’ with more people than ever. These relationships may not always be adding value to our lives and, instead, may be sources ofanxiety. It’s important to regularly assess your contacts on social networks, like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, to see if they need to be adjusted. Some may be more casual acquaintances, while others may be people who would support you if you were in need. Not all ‘friends’ need to be party to all of your discussions and privacy settings can be applied to enable you to have more intimate discussions with only a few good friends. While it can be a lot of fun speaking to new people, especially if we are lacking social connection, there are also dangers associated with starting online relationships. It’s important to stay safe online, as not everyone you meet online (e.g. in a chatroom, forum, or on other social media channels) may be telling the truth and they may not always be who they say they are. Here are some tips for staying safe online: We are living in a generation where there are parents raising children while caring for their own parents The role of being a parent or guardian comes with a number of challenges. This is more so nowadays, when parents may have double caring responsibilities for children and their own parents. It can be difficult to find time together as a couple or to do things for themselves. However, for some, grandparents may be able to be a source of support if parents are returning to work or need a night off from parenting duties. Here are a few tips for parents to avoid experiencing isolation: Learn more with our loneliness help and advice Older people are particularly vulnerable to experiencing social isolation or loneliness due to loss of friends and family, mobility or income. There are a number of things we can do in older age to stay more connected to the people we love and also to create new friendships. The following tips have been adapted from the guide ‘Staying Healthy, Happy and Connected in Older Age’.9While they have been outlined here as tips for older people, these recommendations can be just as readily applied to others who experience isolation. Having regular chats with friends or relatives over the phone or online can be a good substitute for face-to-face contact. There are a range of supports available to help you go online if you haven’t done this before. This can be a good alternative, especially if you are anxious about driving or have been advised to stop driving. Bus travel is free for over 60s in many parts of the UK, including Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. You’ll need to check with your council about when you can apply for a bus pass. There are also services such as Dial-a-Bus and hospital visiting bus services available in some areas. If there’s something you have always wanted to learn to do, why not try and see if you can do it locally? Staying active, joining activity groups such as a walking group or getting a gardening allotment can be great ways to meet new people who share similar interests. Universities and colleges are not just for younger people. Many welcome people of all ages and it may also be worth checking to see if they are offering any short-term or evening courses in a subject area of interest. Additionally, libraries may offer classes in a range of topics, such as learning English, ICT skills, knitting and craft – often for free or for a small fee. You can also join a local choir or singing group to help connect with others while doing something fun that is also good for your wellbeing. Local churches and faith community centres can offer a wide range of activities that are open to the whole community. The Ramblers Association is available to anyone who likes to walk, regardless of age:Ramblers Association England(020 7339 8500);Scotland(0131 472 7006);Wales(029 2064 4308);Disabled ramblers group. Interested in gardening? Your local council should have a list of allotments that are available for the public to use.The National Allotment Society(01536 266576), lists allotments all across the UK. Many national organisations run volunteer programmes. The Retired and Senior Volunteer Programme helps older people use their life experience in their community and particularly welcomes volunteers over the age of 80. For more information, emailrsvpinfo@csv.org.ukor call 020 7643 1385. If you are online, you can find out what volunteering opportunities are available in your area by checking outDo IT. For more suggestions on where you can go to learn new things, or share your skills with others, check out theadvice guides, factsheet and leaflets at Independent Age Keeping in touch online can also be a good substitute for staying connected to friends and family who do not live locally. There is a range of internet providers and it is worth shopping around to get the best deal. Many phone providers offer an internet service as part of a package. Making phone calls through services like Skype, which uses Wi-Fi to make phone calls, means you can either have free phone calls to the other person if they also have a Skype account, or you pay a small charge (which is often cheaper than that of regular phone companies) when you phone from your computer to a landline or mobile phone. Skype allows for face-to-face contact, which can be a great way to continue to feel connected with friends and family who may live in other parts of the world. Age UKruns computer courses all over the UK, which are mostly free and help individuals brush up on their online skills if the thought of going online seems daunting. Once you learn how to use the internet, it can open up a whole new world to you. It’s a great resource for finding out things happening near you and can also be a way to make new friends who share similar interests. Sites to check out include: If you don’t have a personal computer at home, you can usually find one to use for free at your local library, community centre orAge UK. Not everyone finds it easy to stay socially connected or to make new friends. This might be due to being unable to leave the house, living a distance away from other people or because social situations feel uncomfortable. Some people are more vulnerable – for example, if they move to a new area, have recently been bereaved, feel sociallyanxiousor live with a mental health problem that affects their ability to make and/or sustain relationships. For individuals who are more isolated and have few social connections in real life, going online can be a source for meeting new people. If you are online, look for a website where people are either interested in meeting other people or that suits your interests. A few sites to consider include: For individuals who are sociallyanxious, going online can be a good way of staying connected. It can also be a way of challenging any unhelpful thoughts that can act as barriers to socialising. Some online forums can provide a safe way of doing this through virtual social interactions. However, care needs to be taken to protect your privacy and ensure that you don’t engage in unhelpful dialogues. You can unfriend or block people on sites such as Facebook if you feel that the communication is negatively impacting on you. Surround yourself with people who are optimistic and positive in their outlook. If your social anxiety is more persistent and prevents you from participating in everyday life, there are also a number of support options available. Your GP can help you find an approach that will work for you. They may refer you to havecognitive behavioural therapy, which is one of the most effective treatments forsocial anxiety disorder. This may be offered online as well as face to face. See theNHS Choices Social Anxiety Disorder pagefor more information. Mindfulnessis an evidence-based approach that can help manage stress and a range of mental health problems. There are a number of apps and online courses available, including books and exercises that are available on Kindle. For those who live with a mental health problem that makes it difficult to socialise, peer-support groups can help enhance recovery as well as increasing an individual’s social support networks.Peer supportis the help and support that people with lived experience of a mental health problem are able to give to one another. Togetherall is a supportive online community for people who struggle with their mental health. The service is available 24/7 and is completely anonymous and guided by trained professionals.Togetherallis available for free in many areas across the UK through the NHS, employers and some universities. It’s free to all UK-serving personnel, veterans and their families. On the whole, relationships are good for us and, for most of us, are central to living a good life, but that’s not true of all relationships. Sometimes, relationships in our lives can be harmful – for example, when they are characterised by bullying or abuse. It’s important to remember that harmful relationships are not just limited to our romantic partnerships; a person can have a damaging relationship with a friend, co-worker or even a family member. Althoughdomestic violenceis more common among women, men can also experience it and can be exposed to the same range of potentially negative relationships. These toxic relationships are defined by an unhealthy dynamic that two people are participating in. Here are some signs to look out for when assessing whether you are in a toxic or harmful relationship: If you are worried about a harmful relationship, domestic violence or intimate partner violence, you can contact: Some negative relationships can be repaired, but both people in the relationship need to be committed to working on it. If you are in a toxic relationship and you both agree to work to change this dynamic, there are a number of self-help resources available. However, it may also be useful to seek additional support from a professional to help work through a dysfunctional, harmful relationship pattern. Seeing a therapist, either as a couple or individually, who specialises in working with interpersonal issues can help you both find ways of working through any difficulties.

Relationships are one of the most important aspects of our lives, yet we can often forget just how crucial our connections with other people are for our physical and mental health and wellbeing.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/impacts-lockdown-mental-health-children-and-young-people,Impacts of lockdown on the mental health of children and young people,"This content discusses loneliness and isolation, trauma and anxiety, which some people may find triggering. One of the most significant public health measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic has been extended periods of ‘lockdown’, and associated school closures. There have been increasing calls to understand the mental health and wellbeing impacts of the lockdown and school closures for children and young people. Such an understanding will help to inform how children and young people can be best supported as lockdown measures are eased over the coming months. This overview of evidence considers empirical studies of the mental health and wellbeing impacts of lockdown during both the COVID-19 pandemic and during similar health-related disasters in the past. We consider the empirical evidence of impacts across three areas: The focus was on providing an overview of empirical research and therefore we include both primary research articles and articles analysing secondary data or conducting systematic/rapid reviews of empirical literature. We used indicative search terms relating to health disasters (e.g. pandemic, epidemic), lockdown, and mental health and wellbeing to search the Web of Science and PsychInfo databases. We also considered emerging findings from several large-scale surveys on mental health impacts being undertaken during the COVID-19 pandemic. This evidence overview has helped contextualise some of the challenges that children and young people have been and continue to face with respect to their mental health. Going forward, support should pay attention to those for whom lockdown has been particularly challenging. Moreover, children and young people may benefit from the opportunity to validate their experiences of lockdown with their peers and should continue to receive clear communication about the pandemic, including on the return to school. Given the emerging nature of the pandemic, research should continue to longitudinally track the mental health impacts not only on children and young people, but also the impacts within the familial context and within the context of education. Research should pay careful attention to evaluating the effectiveness of support developed for children and young people. In 2019, the Mental Health Foundation commissioned a report titled 'State of a generation: Preventing mental health problems in children and young people'. Mental health problems affect around one in six children. They include depression, anxiety and conduct disorder (a type of behavioural problem), and are often a direct response to what is happening in their lives. 27th Mar 2025

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/doing-good-altruism-and-wellbeing-age-austerity,Doing good? Altruism and wellbeing in an age of austerity,"Altruism means caring about other people and acting in someone else’s interest. We may be acting altruistically whenever we offer someone our seat on the bus, make a cup of tea for a work colleague, donate money to a famine relief fund, or comfort a friend in distress. The desire to do good deeds for other people is natural and deep-rooted, but often misunderstood. Evolutionary biologists, sociologists and philosophers have tried to comprehend why we act in this way, particularly if we do something for another person which is against our own interest. Ultimately, altruism is a mystery we have yet to solve. We do not know whether actions such as helping others, sharing, caring for others, volunteering and donating are wholly selfless or whether they are rooted in self-interest. Our motives may be a mixture of the two. Helping other people and engaging in these kinds of prosocial behaviour has many advantages. It can improve our social relationships, give our lives new purpose, show us other perspectives on our own problems, improve the chances of others reciprocating our good deed, and make us more attractive to the opposite sex. Helping others may even produce a sense of euphoria akin to the sensation we get when eating good food. We have probably all met people who seem selfish and others who seem helpful beyond reason. Being at an extreme of selfishness or selflessness can cause problems both for the individual and those around them. Being too selfish can lead to isolation and poor social relationships, whereas being too selfless can lead to overburden and stress. We are each responsible for our approach to helping others. There are simple, spontaneous ways in which anyone can act selflessly, such as holding a door open for a stranger. There are also structured, more time consuming ways of helping others, such as volunteering for a charity or becoming part of a Time Banking scheme (where you give an hour of your time in exchange for an hour of someone else’s time). Evidence suggests that people, particularly older people, can gain a great deal from formal volunteering, which can reduce social isolation and improve health. In a 2012 national opinion survey we asked 2,037 people how they felt about acts of kindness such as being helpful or volunteering. The majority (76%) agreed with the statement that society had become more selfish and materialistic, and 67% thought people were less likely to be kind to strangers than 10 years ago. The results of the poll also suggest that people still ‘do good’ on a regular basis; 83% said that they held a door open for a stranger in the past week, 72% had let someone go ahead of them in a queue, and 33% had volunteered time or resources to help someone else. The vast majority also said that they felt good after being kind (87%) and that being kind had a positive influence on their health (80%). Despite the problems that our society faces, there are things we can all do for others that can improve the world we live in. We recommend that: There is some evidence to suggest that when you help others, it can promote physiological changes in the brain linked with happiness. In 2020, we found that 63% of UK adults agree that when other people are kind it has a positive impact on their mental health, and the same proportion agree that being kind to others has a positive impact on their mental health. 26th Jun 2025

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/poverty-and-mental-health,Poverty and mental health,"A review to inform the Joseph Rowntree Foundation's Anti-Poverty Strategy Poverty increases the risk of mental health problems and can be both a causal factor and a consequence of mental ill health. Mental health is shaped by the wide-ranging characteristics (including inequalities) of the social, economic and physical environments in which people live. Successfully supporting the mental health and wellbeing of people living in poverty, and reducing the number of people with mental health problems experiencing poverty, require engagement with this complexity. The review presents a conceptual framework for understanding the relationship between poverty and mental health, which draws together: a life course analysis; a discussion of the socio-economic factors (or social determinants) impacting mental health and poverty; the principles ofhuman rights, equity, anti-stigma and non-discrimination; and the approaches ofprevention,self-management,peer support, community development and social movement building. Recommendations for action are made across a number of cross-cutting areas (data and research;stigma and discrimination; and policy development) at different stages of life and across the whole of the life course. Attention is given to pressure points and transitions throughout life, particularly when these are adverse experiences such ashomelessness, redundancy and family breakdown, which can be traumatic and have cumulative impacts. People with complex needs are discussed across the review A growing body of evidence, mainly from high-income countries, has shown that there is a strong socioeconomic gradient in mental health, with people of lower socioeconomic status having a higher likelihood of developing and experiencing mental health problems. We were proud to launch a new partnership between The Poverty Alliance and Mental Health Foundation. Together we will carry out an ambitious research and policy programme to address poverty as a fundamental driver of mental ill-health. Our Head of Policy and Research discusses the impact that poverty can have on mental health on our podcast. Close to a quarter of children and one fifth of working age adults live in poverty in Scotland.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/mental-health-young-women-and-girls-policy-briefing,The mental health of young women and girls policy briefing,"There is authoritative evidence that the mental health of young women and girls is deteriorating, and that the gap between men and women has widened over recent years. Today, young women are three times more likely than men to experience common mental health problems. In 1993, they were twice as likely. Rates of self-harm amongst young women have tripled since 1993, and today’s young women are three times more likely than young men to experience post-traumatic stress disorder. Young women and girls from disadvantaged groups face the greatest risks, and those who have more than one risk factor (for example, black transgender women) bear a particularly complex set of challenges. At the same time, the mental health of young women has slipped down the policy agenda. Fifteen years ago there was a government strategy on women’s mental health, which included efforts to tackle violence against women and place women’s mental health within a wider cross-government drive for gender equality. In 2016/17, major policy announcements have dealt with women’s specific mental health needs almost exclusively in relation to perinatal care, and gender is almost entirely unmentioned. Currently, the needs of young women and girls are tackled within the broader envelope of Children and Young People. The underlying factors for the deterioration of young women and girls’ mental health are complex. Analysts point to the role of domestic violence and abuse, which has risen significantly over recent years. The role of the online culture, social media and pornography also been widely pointed to as a source of increased pressure on young women and girls. Austerity has hit women particularly hard, with House of Commons research showing that 86% of the burden for recent cut-backs falling on women.1 Financial pressures have been particularly tough for black and minority ethnic women. More broadly, cultural and historical changes will have affected other women in a range of complex ways. Whilst there is no single solution for improving the mental health of young women and girls, the first step is to re-prioritise this area of work. We make the following recommendations: In England, around one in five women has a common mental health problem such as anxiety, depression or self-harm. Mental health problems affect both men and women, but not in equal measure. 27th Mar 2025

They include depression, anxiety and conduct disorder (a type of behavioural problem), and are often a direct response to what is happening in their lives. Mental health problems among people with a learning disability are often overlooked, underdiagnosed and left untreated as a result of poor understanding, awareness, evidence in this area and symptoms being mistakenly attributed to the person's learning disability.

Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. My name is Taylor Kane McLaughlin, and since 21 November 2017, I have been doing everything I can to get my life back on track. Taylor shares his story about how his life has changed since his brother, Kirk, tragically took his own life. He tells us about what Kirk went through and how since then, he has chosen to focus his energy on raising awareness around mental health and looking after his mental well-being. Taylor shares the message that it is okay to reach out when you are not feeling okay. On 21 November 2017, I received a phone call from my sister with news that would change my and my family’s lives forever. My big brother, Kirk, gave up his battle with mental health problems and tragically took his own life. Kirk was my best friend, my big brother and my hero. Kirkserved for his countryin the Parachute Regiment (3 PARA), undertaking tours of Northern Ireland and Afghanistan. He saw and experienced things that a normal civilian doesn't, which later on in life had a huge effect on him. Kirk got medically discharged in his twelfth year of service after suffering a severe hip injury. This injury stopped my brother from doing the things he loved, such as running, boxing and weightlifting. Kirk took this badly and found it very hard, especially after having been a paratrooper for near enough his whole life. Kirk then went on to have a major hip operation which left him bed-bound for a good three months, and he never fully recovered. Kirk developed a severe case ofPTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder)and was also diagnosed withbipolar,depressionandanxiety. He had trust issues and major paranoia, which eventually led him to live in seclusion from the outside world. My brother was in a deep dark place and, feeling he couldn’t fight the pain any longer, chose totake his own lifeand be free from his daily battle. Since losing Kirk, I have worked closely with the Mental Health Foundation toraise as much moneyand awareness as possible. I have done my own Charity Football Fun Day, participated in the Virgin Money London Marathon 2018, the National Three Peaks Challenge andtrekked the Great Wall of China. As well as supporting the Mental Health Foundation, this has also, most importantly, been in memory of my big brother Kirk. Through these challenges, I have met the most inspirational, loving, caring people that I can safely say will be my friends for life. Not only has the Mental Health Foundation allowed me to do these things to spread awareness, but, through these challenges, they have helped me with my mental health problems. Along the way, I have learned that it is okay not to be okay and that someone is always there to listen if you are having a bad day. It is important that we look after our mental health and that of others who are close to us, and it is essential that we talk about how we are feeling and, if we need it, know to ask for help. Nothing I can do will ever bring my big brother back, and he will never know how much he was truly loved and the devastation it has left behind for our family and loved ones as we try to rebuild our lives without him. I will always feel he chose the wrong thing to do by ending his own life, and if he had opened up to us all deeply and let us help him, I believe he would still be here today. So, I hope anybody reading this knows that if they have any dark thoughts,help is there, and people care. It’s important to open up and let people know how you truly feel. You will never know what someone is truly going through because it is so easy to hide your true feelings inside your mind, so it’s always important to be kind and caring and to go out of your way to make someone feel that extra bit special.

It presents the latter from the perspective of those working within public health, giving valuable interdisciplinary perspectives that focus on achieving health gains across the population. Public mental health is fundamental to public health in general because mental health is a determinant and consequence of physical health as well as a resource for living.

When this resource is damaged, it leaves us unable to reach our individual and collective potential. The next UK government can make positive changes towards this critical goal of achieving better mental health for all. Over recent years there has been a welcome increased focus on mental health. However, much remains to be done. Every week in England, one in six adults experiences a common mental health problem, such asanxietyordepression, and, at some point in their lives, one in five adults has considered taking their own life. In 2017, 65% of people surveyed said that they have experienced a mental health problem in their lifetime; this figure rose to 71% amongst young people aged 18-34.Mental health problems cost the UK economy 4.1% of GDP each year. It is unlikely that mental health services could ever cope with current demand; mental health problems are already amongst the biggest causes of disability and illness in the UK. The huge and growing prevalence of mental health problems places an unsustainable strain on NHS services and a crucial part of the solution is to reduce the levels of mental distress in society by acting to prevent mental health problems and reduce the risk factors associated with their development. The rates of preventable poor mental health would be considered unacceptable in any other area of health. Now is the time to develop a comprehensive, cross-government action plan that tackles the root causes of mental health problems and improves the wellbeing of the nation. Over the next few years, we believe that the most effective way to make progress against these challenges is by taking action on five fronts: This content discusses trauma, anxiety and depression, which some people may find triggering.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/food-thought-mental-health-and-nutrition-briefing,Food for thought: mental health and nutrition briefing,"What we eat and drink affects how we feel, think and behave. With the recent Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (APMS) finding that one in six people have experienced a common mental problem such asanxietyordepressionin the last week, the need for effective approaches to understanding and improving mental health has never been greater. This briefing focuses on how nutrition can be effectively integrated into public health strategies to protect and improve mental health and emotional wellbeing. It discusses what we know about the relationship between nutrition and mental health, the risk and positive factors within our diets and proposes an agenda for action. One of the most obvious yet under recognised factors in the development of mental health is nutrition. Just like the heart, stomach and liver, the brain is an organ that requires different amounts of complex carbohydrates, essential fatty acids, amino acids, vitamins, minerals and water to remain healthy. An integrated approach that equally reflects the interplay of biological factors, as well as broader psychological, emotional and social conceptions of mental health, is vital in order to reduce the prevalence and the distress caused by mental health problems:dietis a cornerstone of this integrated approach. Dietary interventions may be significant to a number of the mental health challenges society is facing, but we need to know more. There is a lack of investment in research and the translation of knowledge into straightforward guidance about food production and consumption. Nutrition is more than the sum of individual choices and behaviours. Public policy is vital to ensuring that healthy food is understood, available and affordable for all. The role of diet in the nation’s mental health has yet to be fully understood and embraced. The messages about nutrition can appear to be changeable and contradictory, and shifts in policy and practice have been slow to materialise. A general lack of awareness of the evidence base, as well as scepticism about its quality, have limited progress in embracing the role of nutrition in people’s mental health. However, this is beginning to change. It is necessary for individuals, practitioners and policy makers to make sense of the relationship between mental health and diet so we can make informed choices, not only about promoting and maintaining good mental health but also increasing awareness of the potential for poor nutrition to be a factor in stimulating or maintaining poor mental health. This policy briefing covers: What we eat doesn’t just affect our physical health: it can also affect our mental health and wellbeing. We often think of our mind and body as separate, but our mental health and physical health are interconnected. 24th Oct 2025

There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. This is the final report of the National Inquiry into self-harm among young people. This report sets out an agenda for change. Over and over again, the young people we heard from told us that their experience of asking for help often made their situation worse. Many of them have met with ridicule or hostility from the professionals they have turned to. Our intention is that this report will serve as a turning point in understanding self-harm and be a launch pad for changes in the prevention of, and responses to, self-harm among young people in the UK Self-harmamong young people is a major public health issue in the UK. It affects at least one in 15 young people and some evidence suggests that rates of self-harm in the UK are higher than anywhere else in Europe. Self-harm blights the lives of young people and seriously affects their relationships with families and friends. It presents a major challenge to all those in services and organisations that work with young people, from schools through to hospital accident and emergency departments. Levels of self-harm are one indicator of the mental health and mental well-being of young people in our society in general. Recently there has been a shift in government strategies, across the UK, towards recognising and promoting better mental health and emotional well-being for all children and young people. These initiatives may eventually do a great deal to reduce self-harm among young people but the Inquiry found that implementation to date is patchy and there is not yet an adequate evidence base specific to self-harm. This Inquiry set out to try and find the definitive answers to the key questions: Self-harm describes a wide range of things that people do to themselves in a deliberate and usually hidden way. In the vast majority of cases self-harm remains a secretive behaviour that can go on for a long time without being discovered. Self-harm can involve: Young people who self-harm mainly do so because they have no other way of coping with problems and emotional distress in their lives. This can be to do with factors ranging from bullying to family breakdown. But self-harm is not a good way of dealing with such problems. It provides only temporary relief and does not deal with the underlying issues. Although some very young children are known to self-harm, and some adults too, the Inquiry focused on young people aged between 11 and 25 years because rates of self-harm are much higher among young people, and the average age of onset is 12 years old.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/living-anxiety-report,Living with Anxiety report,"This content mentions anxiety, which some people may find triggering. Anxietyis a familiar emotion because it is part of everyone’s experience. Its natural function is to alert us to potential threats, allowing us to evaluate and respond to them in appropriate ways. This heightened state of readiness can also help people perform better and stimulate creative impulses. Anxiety is often regarded as an artefact of modern societies, one that is increasingly represented in visual arts, music, literature and social media. For some people anxiety triggers inappropriate or disproportionate responses to perceived threats, leading to persistent and intrusive symptoms associated with anxiety disorders, such aspanic, phobias andobsessive behaviours, which often have a debilitating effect on their lives. Anxiety is one of the most prevalent mental health problems in the UK and elsewhere, yet it is still under-reported, under-diagnosed and under-treated. This report explores the intersection between popular perceptions of anxiety, the experience of anxiety in people’s everyday lives and the impact of anxiety disorders. Anxiety is a feeling of unease, worry or fear. We all feel anxious sometimes, but anxiety may be a mental health problem if your feelings are very strong or last a long time. A panic attack is a feeling of sudden and intense fear. It can come on quickly and for no apparent reason. Panic attacks can be very frightening, but they’re not dangerous.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/mental-health-equality-manifesto-next-government,Towards mental health equality: a manifesto for the next UK government,"It is seven years since the Health and Social Care Act said the NHS would give mental health parity with physical health – setting out an ambition that mental health should always be treated with the same priority and value as physical health. Since this time, there is no doubt we have seen significant progress in mental health policy. Our Manifesto for Better Mental Health, published before the 2017 General Election, highlighted where urgent improvements were needed. Since then we have seen welcome improvements in several of these areas. This includes: Mental health is now clearly established as a national priority. However, when fewer than four in ten people who need support are accessing mental health services, there is still a long way to go on the road to equality. Our country’s progress on mental health is fragile. Taking concerted action to improve the nation’s mental health is the work of a generation. It’s going to take the sustained commitment and leadership of government to get us there. And at a time when more and more people are speaking out about their mental health and demanding better support, the next government cannot afford not to listen. In this manifesto, we set out five areas that the next government must address in order to improve the lives of people with mental health problems and promote the mental health of the nation. By addressing these areas, the new government will lead the way towards mental health equality and bring us closer to the ambition of a fair deal for mental health. Priorities for the next Prime Minister: This report is from theMental Health Policy Group(of which the Mental Health Foundation is a member). The Mental Health Policy Group (MHPG) is an informal coalition of six national organisations working together to improve mental health through policy influencing activities at the national level. This report considers in more detail the steps that must be taken if the ambition of ‘parity of esteem’ for mental health is to be achieved in England. 15th Oct 2025

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/milks-in-oven-booklet-about-dementia,The Milk's In The Oven: A booklet about dementia for children and young people,"A revised and updated version of the booklet originally written by Lizi Hann in 1998. It explains how people withdementiamight behave and feel, and provides young people with information about the illness and how to cope if someone they know has dementia. There are a number of exercises in the booklet which make it ideal for use in the classroom, as part of a PSHE lesson. Dementia is caused by different illnesses which affect certain parts of the brain. When someone has dementia, they may find that: We asked some 9 and 10 year old children how they would describe memory. Here is what some of them said: Memory is a very important part of all of us. It helps us to make sense of the world around us. Our memory helps us to know who we are, where we are and what we are doing. Our memory helps us remember things like: Often people with dementia forget how to do things – for example, they might put the milk away in the oven, instead of the fridge, or mistake the fridge for the washing machine. As you probably know, our brain is a very complicated organ. It has many different parts which help us to do many different things: Our brain helps us to do things like: think, move, speak, write, play sport, play computer games. In fact, it controls everything that we do every moment of the day. So if something goes wrong with part of our brain, then we are going to find it very hard to do certain things. Inside our brain are millions of brain cells (called neurons). When someone has dementia it is because some of these brain cells have become damaged and started to die. Once these brain cells are dead, they cannot grow again, so this affects what the person with dementia is able to remember, think and do. This is why they find it harder to do all the different things that they used to do every day. There are many different kinds of dementia and many different reasons why people get the disease. The different kinds of dementia have different names. If you know someone with dementia, you might hear names of different kinds of dementia and wonder what these are. It could be Alzheimer’s disease (named after the doctor who first identified it), or it could be vascular dementia (named after the blood vessels in the brain which get damaged). Most people with dementia have either one of these two kinds, but there are other kinds too. Mostly, the ways dementia changes people’s lives are similar. It is important to remember that people cannot catch dementia, like they can chicken pox or flu. Also, if a member of your family has dementia, it doesn’t mean you are more likely to get it. Most cases of dementia do not run in the family. Sometimes we could know what might be causing dementia, so we can try to treat the person with medicine or pills, but at other times we just don’t know why the brain cells become damaged and die so that, bit by bit, the brain stops working as well as it used to. Medicine or pills may help some people for a while but they do not cure people. Scientists and researchers are doing a lot of work to try and find out why dementia happens to some people and not others. 'Nothing really makes sense to me now.’ Rachel – 79 years old – has dementia. This quote shows the confusion that Rachel feels. Here are two exercises that people who are learning how to care for people with dementia sometimes do. It helps them to imagine what dementia feels like. Try it for yourself. Sit or lie down. Close your eyes and imagine what it would be like getting ready for school when you can’t remember where you put your shoes, don’t know the way to school or what you are supposed to do when you get there. Now and again it will feel as if the fog lifts and people with dementia can suddenly make sense of everything for a moment. But then the fog comes down and they feel lost again. Sit or lie down. Close your eyes. Imagine you are in the middle of a thick, thick fog. Sit still and quiet and listen to all the sounds around you. What can you hear? Maybe cars, people’s voices or the television? Listen for a couple of minutes, soaking up all the sounds. Now keeping your eyes closed, imagine that you no longer recognise the sounds, they are all coming at you in a jumble. Imagine that the volume has been turned up, that someone is spinning you round and round, and you feel frightened and confused. You don’t know where you are, who anybody is and what all the sounds mean. This is what someone with dementia can feel like. Here are some of the words used by people who have dementia to describe how they feel: Many people with dementia know that something is wrong, especially during the early stages. They are losing a lifetime of stored memories, and there is nothing they can do about it. So it is understandable that they feel some of these emotions. We asked some children ‘What do you think it would be like to lose your memory?’This is what they said: ‘My memory, it slims away.’ We talked about memory at the beginning of the booklet. We know that it is very important to us. So what do you think it would be like if you found your memory fading away? Someone with dementia might agree with some or all of the above statements. Sometimes it may well feel like they have a ‘dark, blank head’, and sometimes they will struggle to remember the names and faces of their family. It is very important to remember that the person with dementia still has thoughts, feelings and emotions. But these thoughts, feelings and emotions are all jumbled up. Sometimes they will be able to remember something that happened many years ago, as if it was yesterday, and at other times they will feel as if they are surrounded by the thick fog that we talked about at the beginning of the chapter. ‘These people have lived for a long time, they have been babies, children and adults. Many have been through a world war. In their time they have seen man go to the moon, aeroplanes built, cars become part of everyday life, televisions, DVDs, mobile phones and the internet all appear.’ (Psychiatric nurse) It is easy to forget that the person with dementia is still an individual. They have their own thoughts and feelings and their own ways of coping with their illness. Let’s think about you for a moment. Sit and think about these questions: No two people will have the same answers to all of these questions. As you grow older, all the experiences that you have throughout your life - starting from the moment you are born - become part of your life. These experiences help to shape your character and personality and this is what makes each of us different and special in our own way. Everyone with dementia has their own character and personality, even if it seems hidden and changed because of the dementia. Sometimes it will seem as if they are a completely different person from who they were before, but they are not blank people with blank minds. It’s easy to forget that people with dementia have a past. Talking to someone with dementia about their past – even for a few minutes - can give them a lot of pleasure and helps us to remember they have led a full and active life. It also helps to make their present worthwhile. All these feelings that we have talked about are perfectly natural. It is part of life, and part of coping with things that go wrong to feel sad, frustrated and angry. But there are some feelings that we have talked about that we can do something about. The most important thing you can do for the person with dementia is to make a little bit of time for them. Whether they are living in their own home, in a care home, in hospital or with you and your family, time is the most important thing that you can give to the person with dementia. And it doesn’t have to be much - five minutes of sitting and chatting, or showing them a picture you have drawn, or a photo that they may recognise could make a world of difference. Here are some other ideas: Of course, all these things may not be possible all of the time, and there may be days when you just don’t feel like spending any time with them. That’s fine too - you can only do as much as you feel like doing. Here are some ideas that children came up with: But if they don’t remember who I am what’s the point? Some days will be harder than others. It depends how long the person has had dementia. As the dementia gets worse they will find it more and more difficult to remember names and faces, even of their family and friends. This can be very upsetting and you might wonder “what’s the point in spending time with them?” But there will be times when they do know what’s going on. This could be in the middle of the night, or when they have a moment alone, or when you are with them. It will give them a great deal of happiness to know that you care about them. For a person with dementia to know that they are loved, respected and cared for by their family is probably the most important thing in their life. No matter how old someone is or how ill, they are still a person. And even though they may not always show it, they are people with feelings - just like you and me. We should always treat a person with dementia just as we would like to be treated when we are older. Sometimes it is difficult to treat someone with respect andkindnesswhen they have dementia. They might be rude to you, shout at you or simply not recognise you. Always remember that it is their dementia making them behave that way and that it’s not your fault, and it’s not their fault. All you can do is your best. We asked some children how they would like to be treated when they are older.This is what they said: Lots is being done in the scientific and medical world to try and understand dementia and to find more ways to help people and to find a cure. Until there is a cure and a way to prevent people from ever getting dementia, lots more needs to be done to help everyone understand dementia and to make sure the best kinds of help are available from family members, friends, doctors, nurses, care staff and others. We can all try to help people who have dementia by being as understanding as we can, helping them whenever possible and telling other people what we have learnt about dementia. Most of all though, it’s important to remember that, even though a person who has dementia might act in a way that is upsetting or confusing sometimes, they are still the same person that they always were. Who do you think needs to know about dementia? Think of every kind of person you can. What do you think they need to know? Try and think of everything that would help different kinds of people. Dementia isn’t just about memory loss. It can affect how you think, feel, speak and behave. Patricia, Diane and Deirdre tell their stories of living with dementia. 24th Oct 2025

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/mental-health-equality-developing-cross-government-approach,Towards equality for mental health: developing a cross-government approach,"This report from the Mental Health Policy Group (of which we are a member) considers in more detail the steps that must be taken if the ambition of ‘parity of esteem’ for mental health is to be achieved in England. Its starting point is the belief that improving the nation’s mental health cannot be achieved through a focus on health services alone, vital though these are. A much more ambitious, cross-government approach to mental health is also required. In this report, we set out our recommendations for what should be included in such a strategy, together with the action required to give people the right care, at the right time and in the right place from a well-configured, well-trained and well-supported workforce. This report reflects the collective view of members of theMental Health Policy Group. In developing our thinking, we sought the views of a broad range of organisations and professionals from the wider mental health and voluntary sectors, including those representingphysical health conditions,money and debt,homelessnessandaddiction. In December 2018, many of these organisations signed a Consensus Statement on the principles that should inform the NHS Long Term Plan (Annex A); these principles remain important as it is implemented. We hope that our recommendations for future action will gain support from everyone who shares our ambition for achieving equality for mental health. The Mental Health Policy Group (MHPG) is an informal coalition of six national organisations working together to improve mental health through policy influencing activities at the national level. In this manifesto, we set out five areas that the next government must address in order to improve the lives of people with mental health problems and promote the mental health of the nation. 15th Oct 2025

There is a strong moral and economic case for tackling the rising challenge of mental health problems for communities and the people who experience them. There are also clear, evidence-based and cost-effective steps that can be taken to build resilience, promote wellbeing and help to prevent mental health problems. This report focuses on resilience; setting out the types of services, resources and infrastructure that need to be in place locally to support resilient communities, helping people to ‘feel good and function well’. Resilience should be central to any public mental health strategy but is only one element; it is essential that structural inequalities, like income or access to affordable housing, are also tackled.

In 2020 Royal Blind and Scottish War Blinded published a policy report “Social Connections and Sight Loss.” This report studied the links betweenlonelinessand sight loss; the research findings suggested that around two thirds of blind and partially sighted people have experienced loneliness because of their sight loss. The report highlighted many experiences of challenges to mental wellbeing and episodes of emotionaltraumaas a result of visual impairment. This ranged from blind and partially sighted pupils struggling to make friendships, young people accessing counselling to help them manageanxietylinked to their visual impairment and veterans with sight loss experiencing chronic mental health challenges. We collaborated with the Royal Blind and Scottish War Blinded to build on these findings, develop a deeper understanding of the wider emotional impact of sight loss,and develop policy recommendations. 26th Jun 2025

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/boiling-point,Boiling Point: Anger and what we can do about it,"Mounting evidence links anger with a range of physical, mental and social problems. Chronic and intense anger has been linked with Coronary Heart Disease, stroke, cancer and common physical illnesses including colds and flu, and generally poorer health as well as increased risk-taking, poor decision-making and substance misuse. Higher levels of anger are related to lower levels of social support and higher stress levels. High levels of anger expression have also been associated with less frequent use of positive coping strategies such as actively addressing problems. Anger has also been linked with mental health problems including depression and self-harm. People describe anger as more likely to have a negative effect on interpersonal relationships than any other emotion. There is evidence to suggest that societal changes are contributing to a rise in emotional problems. Public polling carried out for this report indicates that a majority of the population believe that people in general are getting angrier. Influential authors quoted in this report have examined life in 21st century Western society and stated recently that we are we are getting angrier, and that despite 50 years of economic growth in the UK, we are no happier. However, any changes we are witnessing are unlikely to be in the core structure of our basic emotions. Evolution is a slow process - rapid changes are instead occurring in our social habits, and economic and political circumstances, and how they influence our thinking, feeling and behaviour. This report is about problem anger, how it affects individuals, families and communities, and what we can do to minimise the harm it causes. This booklet outlines how anger works and explains the benefits of keeping your anger level under control or expressing it in a constructive way. Anger is a universal human emotion that can be seen in the facial expressions of infants as young as six months. Despite this, anger is frequently misunderstood. 26th Jun 2025

The aim of this paper is to scope the public mental health research landscape today with a particular focus on the evidence aroundpreventionand the fundamental determinants of mental health and mental health inequity. The paper will be used to inform debates on the character of public mental health evidence, to generate recommendations for future evidence reviews to be undertaken by MHF and to progress our Research Strategy, which will be underpinned a transdisciplinary and translational approach. This approach will focus on identifying the types of interventions that will create substantial impact. Prevention is an important approach to improving mental health. It means stopping mental health problems from developing, getting worse or coming back. Despite the cost-effectiveness of preventing mental health problems in the long term, there are gaps in the research base on prevention of mental ill health.

An Initial inquiry based research project was undertaken in partnership with Age Concern (now Age UK) and more recently in 2007-2009 service improvement activities were undertaken in partnership with NHS Health Scotland and the large number of key stakeholders forming NHS Health Scotland’s later life steering group. These activities included work with 15 Community Health Partnerships. This work directly engaged upwards of 1,000 older people in Scotland and provided further understanding of the key issues effecting mental health in later life. Consistent themes that emerged were: (Age Concern & Mental Health Foundation, 2006; NHS Health Scotland, 2009) This work has sat alongside and complemented the strategic work of NHS Health Scotland and the Scottish government on developments such as ‘All our Futures’, ‘Towards a Mentally Flourishing Scotland’ and the EU Healthy Ageing Strategy (Scottish Executive, 2007; Scottish Government, 2010). During these activities it became apparent that there were large numbers of older people who were missing from these discussions and were therefore unable to have their voices heard, older people who are living their lives trapped in their own homes with little or no social support networks or links to the wider community. This significant gap has framed the development of Brighter Futures and informed the approach of peer mentoring. In developing solutions to these challenges older people told us that it was important to take account of the contribution they could make as well as their potential support needs. In shaping Brighter Futures we felt that it was vital that we acknowledged that although there is much to do in relation to designing effective services for older people, there is also a steadily increasing number of older people, mainly retired from paid work, who are able to contribute actively to society – a strength not a ‘burden’. The principle aim of Brighter Futures has therefore been: To work with older people to deliver apeer mentoring serviceaimed at improving the wellbeing and the quality of lives of more isolated older people through enhancing their social networks and enabling meaningful community engagement. As we get older, changes in our lives such as retirement, bereavement or physical illness can affect our mental health. We have produced this booklet for people in their 60s who are approaching retirement or who have recently retired from work.

We wanted to examine what types of ‘connection interventions’ could assist those with lived mental ill-health experience move towards employment – and self-employment. Furthermore, it was recognised ideas that could help to develop a successful intervention could create opportunities for people with mental health problems to have greater financial independence which is also linked to enhanced wellbeing. 6th May 2025

This work is part of a larger project funded by the Long Term Conditions Alliance Scotland (LTCAS) to build capacity inpeer supportservices forlong term conditions. This guidance builds on a two-stage research project undertaken by MHF from 2010-2011. The research found evidence of peer support activity for people with long term conditions across Scotland with positive impact on emotional and physical health, but that access to such services was patchy. Furthermore peer support services (all voluntary sector based) reported difficulties integrating with statutory services and felt they often lacked credibility in the eyes of potential referrers, especially clinicians and beneficiaries. There is an increasing body of research and anecdotal evidence which demonstrates the benefit of peer support for managing long term conditions. There is a need not only to support increased access to this valuable and unique form of support but also to enhance the quality and impact of existing peer support throughout Scotland. It is hoped that this document will contribute to supporting NHS and voluntary sectors to work in partnership to develop services to address these needs. This guidance is designed to support organisations currently delivering peer support or planning to develop peer support for people with long term conditions. It brings together good practice and guidance, based on research evidence as well as the experiences of experts in delivering peer support and those who have received peer support. This guidance is intended to provide a brief and concise starting point, to be accessible to a wide audience and is applicable across all long term conditions. Throughout this document links to further detailed guidance and sources of support are provided. The guidance covers the following topics, the basic building blocks to developing and improving the quality of peer support services, which are: The Developing Peer Support for Long Term Conditions: Final Report features findings from a feasibility study. Anna, along with other experts share their experiences and knowledge of peer support and argue that it should be rolled out more widely.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/all-about-depression-booklet,All About Depression booklet,"This content mentions depression, which some people may find triggering. This booklet is for anyone who wants to know more aboutdepression. You may be experiencing depression yourself and wondering where to find help. You may be supporting a friend or relative who seems to be depressed, or you may work with people who have symptoms of depression. This booklet will give you information about depression and the kinds of help, which are available. At the end of the booklet you will find details of useful organisations, as well as examples of further reading. We have included extra information on depression in older people, since depression in this age group is often overlooked. The message of this booklet is that depression is a common and serious mental health problem, but there are many ways you can help yourself to recover and resume a happy and fulfilling life. The more information you have, the better you will be able to ask for the help you need. The worddepressionis used to describe a range of moods – from low spirits to a severe problem that interferes with everyday life. If you are experiencing severe or 'clinical' depression you are not just sad or upset. The experience of depression is an overwhelming feeling which can make you feel quite unable to cope, and hopeless about the future. If you are depressed your appetite may change and you may have difficulty sleeping or getting up. You may feel overwhelmed by guilt, and may even find yourself thinking about death or suicide. There is often an overlap between anxiety and depression, in that if you are depressed you may also become anxious or agitated. Sometimes it is difficult to decide whether you are responding normally to difficult times, or have become clinically depressed. A rough guide in this situation is that if your low mood or loss of interest significantly interferes with your life (home, work, family, social activities), lasts for two weeks or more, and brings you to the point of thinking about suicide then you may be experiencing clinical depression and you should seek some kind of help. Anyone can become depressed. Approximately one person in six experiences depression of some kind in the course of their lifetime and one in 20 experiences clinical depression. At any one time, about one in 10 people will have some symptoms of depression. Of course, people who are depressed do not always seek help and even if they do, they may not always be diagnosed as depressed, so these figures are only estimates. People from all backgrounds, ages and cultures can experience depression, although people vary in how they express their difficulties. For example, some people use words such as ‘sad’ or ‘low’ to describe feeling depressed, whereas other people describe their feelings in terms of their body, such as ‘a pain in my heart’. In many Western countries women are more likely than men to be diagnosed with depression, this is partly because men are less likely to talk about problems in a way that allows their depression to be picked up. Men are also more likely than women to use alcohol to cope with feeling depressed. About two per cent of children under 12 experience depression. This rises to about five per cent for teenagers. A particular worry is the rise in the numbers of young men who attempt suicide, which may be associated with depression, hopelessness, or difficulties in their lives. Depression in both women and men is often linked to life changes or to loneliness. About 10 per cent of women experiencepost-natal depressionin the weeks following childbirth. Social factors which can make people more at risk of becoming depressed includeloss of employment, bereavement and problems with relationships. People over 65 seem to have a slightly greater risk of depression. This risk gets much higher in people over 85 years old. It can be particularly difficult to recognise depression in older people because they are less likely to talk about feeling sad or low, and more likely to talk about physical problems such as loss of energy ordifficulty sleeping. This means that GPs, family and friends may not understand how they are feeling. In older people it appears that depression is less likely to ‘lift’ without help, particularly if they are severely depressed. This may explain why older depressed people have a high suicide rate, particularly men over the age of 75 years old. Depression can also be confused with the effects of other health problems, which are more common in later life. People who are depressed often report feeling confused and having difficulty in thinking and remembering things. In older people it is important to find out whether these problems are due to depression or to the development ofdementia– for example in Alzheimer's Disease or following a stroke. Professionals look for the following key symptoms when deciding if you are depressed: You are likely to receive a diagnosis of depression if you experienceat least fiveof these symptoms over a two-week period. However, the most important signs are depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, or a loss of interest or pleasure in things you previously enjoyed. People have different patterns of depression; for example some people are severely depressed for a relatively short time while others have milder depression over a number of years. Even if the depression seems mild it is still important to identify it, as it can have a big impact on your life and you are more likely to face serious depression later on in life. The following are some specific types of depression which have been identified. About one per cent of the population will experiencebipolar disorderat some time in their lives. A diagnosis of bipolar disorder means that you have both ‘high’ and ‘low’ mood swings, along with changes in thoughts, emotions and physical health. The mood swings are normally more extreme than everyday ups and downs. This problem is sometimes also referred to as manic depression. Most people with bipolar disorder have their first episode of depression in their late teens or early twenties, and without treatment it is very likely to recur. For further information contact theManic Depression Fellowship. About 10 to 15 per cent of women experiencepost-natal depressionin the first year after having a baby. They may be unusually tearful, anxious or irritable, and may also find it difficult to play with their babies and respond positively to them. Although most women get the so-called ‘baby blues’ in the first few days after childbirth because of rapid hormone changes, post-natal depression is very different from this and lasts longer. It is probably due to a mixture of biological, psychological and social factors, and women are particularly at risk of post-natal depression if they do not have a supportive partner or family to help them. If you seem to be showing signs of post-natal depression your Health Visitor should be able to assess you and either provide help or refer you to another professional. Most women with post-natal depression are helped by supportive counselling, by talking to other women who have been through a similar experience, and by anti-depressant medication. For further information contact theAssociation for Post-natal Illness. Some people describe feeling depressed regularly at certain times of the year. A key feature of this kind of depression is the desire to sleep more and eat carbohydrate foods. Usually this kind of depression, known asSeasonal Affective Disorder, starts in the autumn or winter, when daylight is reduced. If you experience this kind of depression you may be helped by specially designed bright light therapy. For further information contact theSAD Society. There are many possible causes of depression. You may have an increased risk of experiencing depression because of your particular biological make-up. On the other hand, depression is also related to what is happening in your life, and the kind of support you receive from others. There is some evidence that depression seems to run in families, but there is no single gene which causes depression. A family history of depression may increase the risk, but this may be because of difficulties the family has in coping, and it certainly does not mean that depression is inevitable. Genes seem to be more important than childhood experiences in determining the risk of bipolar disorder. We know that depression is associated with changes in the activity of certain brain chemicals, known as neurotransmitters, which affect our mood and thinking. These chemicals, such as serotonin, are also affected by factors such as activity and exercise. Drug treatment aims to restore 'normal' levels of neurotransmitter activity (see section below entitled 'Coping with severe depression - what works? i) Drug Treatment'). Past experiences which may be difficult or traumatic, such as losing a parent when very young, can affect your ability to cope with difficult situations. Children who experience abuse or lack of affection are also more at risk of experiencing depression in later life. An episode of depression can be ‘triggered’ bystressful thingsthat happen in our lives, particularly events involvinga loss of some kind- such as unemployment, leaving home, death of a family member or friend. Even an apparently happy event can also bring a sense of loss; for example, parents can feel they have 'lost' their son or daughter when they get married, even if they are very happy for them. If you have had to cope with a lot of changes or stressful events, one more may seem like the 'last straw'. Older people often have to cope with repeated losses, including the death of close friends and family. There is an important difference between expressing grief - which is a healthy reaction to loss or bereavement - and depression. Men living alone after the death of their wives seem to be particularly at risk of depression. Young people also experience stress, for example due to problems at school, starting work or a course of study, or problems with relationships. It can be quite difficult to tell whether a young person is going through 'normal' adolescent turmoil or is showing signs of depression. People who are depressed tend to think about bad experiences in ways that make them even more difficult to manage. If you have had bad experiences in the past, which you were unable to control, you may develop a ‘hopeless’ way of thinking. Feeling ‘trapped’ in a difficult situation or experiencing a feeling of humiliation can also lead to negative thinking and depression. This is why some forms of treatment aim to help you change your patterns of thinking (see section below entitled 'Coping with severe depression - what works? ii) Non-drug treatment). We all tend to feel miserable when we are ill. Butlong-term health problems, which prevent someone from leading their usual life, may lead to depression. People who lose their eyesight or hearing can become depressed, as can people with heart disease, chronic lung diseases, and illnesses which prevent them from getting about, such as Parkinson’s disease or a stroke. Family and friends can help a lot by helping people find new activities or interests following illness. Some difficult life events may become more common with age, for example, children moving away, family illness or disability. Health or financial problems can also increase with age. However, many people find that there are positive benefits of growing older, such as having more free time, being able to take up hobbies, or spend time with grandchildren. It is therefore wrong to assume that depression in older people is a ‘normal’ reaction to growing older, and it is important that severe depression is recognised, so that people can get the help they need. There are a number of things you can do for yourself which can help you cope with mild episodes of depression, or reduce your risk of becoming seriously depressed. Having someone to turn to for support is very important when coping with difficulties. Some people build up a strong network of friends and relatives whom they can talk to, but others may become isolated, particularly if they have no employment or other activity outside the home. People who are already depressed usually find it very difficult to be sociable, and this can make them feel worse. So having someone to support you in a crisis or when things are difficult can reduce your risk of becoming depressed. If you are physically active or take regularexerciseyou may benefit from changes in your brain chemicals which affect mood, and from the feeling that you are actively doing something to improve your life. Exercise and activity can also bring important social contact if you are isolated. Outdoor activity seems to be particularly important in staving off depression for older men. However if you don't enjoy exercise it is unlikely to help. A healthydietis important in reducing the risk of depression. In particular, drinking too muchalcoholor takingdrugswill make you feel worse in the long-term. Some recent research has suggested that people who are depressed or have bipolar disorder may benefit from eating more oily fish, such as sardines, or from taking fish oil supplements, alongside their prescribed medication. However further research into this is needed. Many people are interested in using complementary therapies to relieve depression. There is evidence that the herbal medicine known as St John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) can help many people with mild to moderate depression. However, we do not yet know whether it is effective in treating more severe depression. Before taking St John’s Wort check with your doctor or pharmacist especially if you are taking other kinds of medication, for example for heart disease, epilepsy, asthma, or migraine, as St John’s Wort may effect how these drugs work. Relaxation techniques, aromatherapy, massage, and acupuncture, may also help people cope when they are feeling low. If you are trying a complementary therapy as well as receiving medical treatment you should inform your doctor so that the effects can be monitored. One aspect of depression is the feeling that, whatever you do, you cannot improve your situation. An important step is to find situations or activities where you can feel that you have some control over your life instead of feeling hopeless. Setting yourself small manageable goals can give you a sense of achievement and make you feel better. Older people in particular may feel that they are no longer valued as employees or needed as parents. Helping other people – for example through voluntary work – is one good way of feeling useful and valued. There are a number of self-help books, guides, and software programmes which can help you to learn ways of coping with mild to moderate episodes of depression. Some of these are listed at the end of this booklet. Bear in mind that although many people have found these helpful, everybody is different! If you do not find them helpful, or if your depression is more severe, you should ask for more specialist help. Some people find it very helpful to talk to others who have been through similar experiences. Some of the organisations listed at the end of the booklet can put you in contact with other people, individually or in groups. Anti-depressant drugsact by increasing the activity of those brain chemicals which affect the way we feel. Anti-depressants help between 60 and 70 per cent of people with depression. A number of different kinds of drugs may be prescribed, for example: Tricyclic anti-depressants are prescribed for moderate to severe depression. Some examples are dothiepin, imipramine, and amitryptyline. Tricyclic anti-depressants may take several weeks to start working so don't expect results straightaway. They sometimes cause drowsiness, so talk to your doctor if this is a problem. Other possible side-effects include blurred vision, a dry mouth, constipation, sexual problems, and weight gain. These side-effects can usually be reduced by changing to a different brand or by starting at a lower dose and gradually increasing it. Tricyclic anti-depressants are not addictive. Newer anti-depressant drugs - selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs and SNRIs) target specific chemical ‘messengers’ in the brain. The most well known SSRI is fluoxetine (Prozac) but there are several other brands. The most significant side-effects from these newer drugs are headaches, stomach upsets, and reduced sex drive. However some people become more anxious and restless when taking them and there have been reports of some people becoming aggressive. As with all drugs, if you have any unusual reactions you should discuss them with a doctor straightaway. For example, venlafaxine (Efexor) can cause a skin rash which should be reported to a doctor immediately. Lithium carbonate may be prescribed to people with bipolar disorder as a way of stabilising their mood swings. It is also sometimes used as an additional treatment for people with severe depression alongside anti-depressants. High levels of lithium in the blood can be dangerous, so if you are taking lithium you must have regular blood tests. Other mood stabilisers include carbamazepine. If you are prescribed drugs for depression you will probably be advised to take them for at least six months, or longer if you have a previous history of depression. Older people may have to carry on taking drugs for longer than younger people. You are more likely to 'relapse' (have another episode of depression) in the three months after you have started to recover - which is why doctors usually recommend taking the medication for a further six months. It is important to feel confident that you candiscuss your medication with your GPor pharmacist. Family and friends can help by encouraging you to report any unpleasant side–effects, especially when a new or different drug is prescribed. There are also special helplines which will give you general advice on medication. If you stop taking anti-depressant drugs suddenly you can experience unpleasant effects, such as headache, nausea, dizziness and even hallucinations. Always consult your doctor before stopping taking anti-depressants and never stop suddenly as the effects may be severe. Remember that it can take at least six weeks for you to begin to recover, but by six months four out of five people will be better. Tricyclic drugs have been used with children but they seem to be less effective than with adults. The newer SSRIs have not yet been adequately tested with children. As people grow older they are increasingly likely to be prescribed drugs for medical conditions. If drugs for depression are added there can be unexpected side-effects, such as dizziness and confusion. Sometimes just taking too many different drugs can produce symptoms of depression. People with memory problems may forget to take their drugs, particularly if they have lots of different drugs to take. You may like to ask the pharmacist to supply the pills in a 'dosette' - a special container, which has separate compartments for each day of the week, or each time of day. People diagnosed withdementia(such as Alzheimer’s disease) often experience depression, but anti-depressant drugs seem to be less effective for them than for other people of the same age. They may also experience more side-effects from medication, such as loss of appetite or increased confusion. Anti-depressant drugs should only be prescribed to people in nursing homes if they are actually depressed, not to deal with behaviour problems related to dementia. CBTis a type of talking treatment. It is based on the fact that the way we feel is partly dependent on the way we think about events (cognition). It also stresses the importance of behaving in ways which challenge negative thoughts and unhelpful beliefs. CBT aims to help you examine some of the beliefs you hold about yourself, often as a result of early experiences - such as 'I am worthless'. Although it may sound like common sense, CBT is not just positive thinking. If you are depressed, a CBT therapist will carry out an individual assessment and use questions and exercises to help you see your situation in different ways and to build up coping skills. It is important that CBT is delivered by someone who has been properly trained, such as a clinical psychologist or specially trained nurse. You may also find it useful to have someone to help with the activities such as 'homework' exercises. Research shows that CBT is effective for people with mild or moderately severe depression. A combination of drugs and CBT produces good results for severe depression. CBT may also reduce the risk of you experiencing another period of depression. CBT has been used successfully with children and young people, particularly those with moderate levels of depression. If you are older you are less likely to be offered talking treatments such as CBT, even though you are just as likely to benefit from them as younger people. Interpersonal therapy focuses on your relationships and on problems such as difficulties in communication, or coping with bereavement. There is some evidence that IPT can be as effective as medication or CBT but more research is needed. Counsellors are trained to help you think about the problems you are experiencing in your life and find new ways of coping with difficulties. They give support and help you find your own solutions, rather than offering advice or treatment, but some counsellors also use some of the techniques fromtalking therapiessuch as CBT. ECT is a controversial treatment which is used for people with severe depression in an emergency (for example when someone has stopped eating) or for people who have not responded well to other treatments. The person receiving ECT is given an anaesthetic and drugs to relax their muscles. They then receive an electrical 'shock' to the brain, through electrodes placed on the head. Most people are given a series of ECT sessions. Some people say that ECT is very helpful in relieving their depression, although others have reported unpleasant experiences, including memory problems. There has been a lot of concern about the way ECT has been used, and clearer guidelines and standards have now been developed. ECT cannot be given without your consent, except in very special circumstances, for example when your life is at risk. There is some evidence that older people may be given ECT rather than offered alternative forms of treatment. This may be because practitioners feel that older people take longer to respond to drug treatment, or because the drugs are not suitable for them. It is important that adequate time is given for drugs or other treatments to be effective before deciding to use ECT. Another important consideration is that people having ECT need a general anaesthetic, which carries more risks in older people. ECT should not be considered when people have severe heart or lung disease. The first step is to be honest with yourself: your sadness or unhappiness is interfering with your everyday life. While relatives and friends can often help you through 'bad patches', severe depression needs professional help. That doesn't mean you shouldn't tell people close to you what is going on if you can - it will help them to know, and their ongoing support can be very valuable. Some employers are sympathetic to those with mental health problems, although others may worry about the effects on your work and that you may need to take time off. You shouldvisit your family doctor (GP)who will probably offer some kind of treatment or support, or may refer you to a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist. It's important to remember that treating depression can take time, but you should be confident in the care you are receiving. If, for example, you would like to see a psychiatrist, you can ask your GP to make an appointment for you. Some people prefer to bypass their GP and consult a specialist privately. There are a number of places where you can go to get further help, as follows: Depression is a distressing experience but there are many kinds of help available. Sadly you may not always get the help you need, sometimes because you may feel too hopeless about your situation to ask. After reading this booklet you may like to discuss it with your GP or talk it through with family or friends. You may also like to contact one of the organisations or helplines listed below. Remember that most people do recover from depression and there is a lot you can do to help yourself. If you feel affected by the content you have read, please see ourget helppage for support. We all have times when we feel down, but depression is about more than feeling sad or fed up for a few days. Depression causes a low mood that lasts a long time and affects your daily life. Depression is a common mental disorder that causes people to experience depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep or appetite, low energy, and poor concentration. Understanding how depression affects your partner can be key to building a healthy, supportive relationship that supports both people’s mental wellbeing.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/all-things-being-equal,All Things Being Equal,"Location:England Older people with mental health problems in England do not receive the same level or quality of care as younger people. Despite policies and guidelines setting out the importance of age equality in mental health care, both direct and indirect discrimination has continued to occur within services. This has been due in part to the way in which divisions have traditionally been created in services between care for working age adults and older people within mental health and social care. Age thresholds, usually set at 65, have meant that some older people are unable to receive or access a range of services and treatment available to younger adults. This paper sets out the background to the current situation, based on evidence published by a range of organisations with an interest in the provision of older people’s mental health care. It looks at the challenges and implications for the future posed by the increasing number of older people in England, and makes recommendations aimed at ensuring older people receive the best possible health and social care and support on a fair and equitable basis. As we get older, changes in our lives such as retirement, bereavement or physical illness can affect our mental health.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/building-resilience-fishing-sector-wales,Building resilience in the fishing sector in Wales,"Location:Wales As the UK journeys towards leaving the European Union (EU), there remains considerable uncertainty for the fishing industry, fishermen and coastal communities in Wales. Periods of significant uncertainty can have detrimental impact on health and well-being. During these times, it is of considerable importance to both understand and address underlying causes ofanxietyand distress, alongside supporting the health and mental well-being of those most likely to be affected. This report aims to develop a framework to support the mental health and well-being of fishermen at times of uncertainty, and consider how it could be translated into action. To achieve this, we combined a review of the international literature from the past ten years with the collective views of thirteen stakeholders from across the fishing sector in Wales. Note: This research programme was undertaken within the context of the UK leaving the EU. The findings reflect the evidence and views at a point in time before the COVID-19 pandemic. However, many of the uncertainties and challenges identified are longstanding issues facing fishermen in Wales, that have the potential to be further exacerbated by Brexit and COVID-19. The approaches outlined for supporting mental health and well-being remain timely and relevant to today’s context. The report draws out the key uncertainties and challenges faced by fishermen and fishing communities in Wales; and outlines preventative approaches for protecting against health impacts and promoting mental health and well-being, to strengthen resilience.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/interface-between-dementia-and-mental-health,The interface between dementia and mental health,"While there has been considerable and welcome attention in the area ofdementiaover recent years, themental health of people in later life, and specifically the complex relationship between dementia and mental health problems, is a neglected area in public discourse, policy and service provision. In this paper we explore the relationship between dementia, mental health and mental health problems. To do this, an evidence review was carried out to explore the extent that people living with dementia have co-existing mental health problems. The review initially examined the limited available literature on the incidence and experiences of comorbidity of dementia and mental health problems. Several interviews were then undertaken to get a clearer idea of the real world experiences of those working with people living with dementia and mental health problems, to help fill some of the current gaps in literature on comorbidity. It begins with a section discussing the similarities and differences between dementia, cognitive impairment and mental health problems, followed by a section on the identification issues. We then discuss the current policy in relation to mental health and dementia, and the social and economic costs associated with both. Care, service provision and treatment methods identified through the review are then discussed, followed by gaps and resources. The review ends with some recommendations based on the findings of the review. The main finding of this review is that comorbidities are underdiagnosed in people living with dementia, not extensively researched and therefore not understood fully. The relationship between dementia and mental health problems is not well documented, and extensive searching found relatively little literature on the challenges or experiences associated with living with this co-morbidity. There was also an overwhelming lack of literature on the care needs of those with dementia who develop a mental health problem or for those with a pre-existing mental health problem with develop dementia. This translates into a lack of understanding within service provision and an absence of specialised services for people living with both mental health problems and dementia, which was confirmed through the interviews with people working as service providers. Based on our review of the available information, we have produced the following recommendations: Policy level Organisation level Programme level Cross-cutting Dementia isn’t just about memory loss.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/articles/change-loss-bereavement,"Change, loss and bereavement","This content mentions death and bereavement, which some people may find triggering. We have all been through times of change, and some of us have experienced loss of different types, including the profound loss experienced when someone close to us dies. Change and loss can involve many things. During the coronavirus pandemic, all of us have been affected one way or another by changes. This may have been adjusting to the loss of not being able to go where we choose or coping with the loss in our income or job. The latter can in turn affect our identity. Whatever the loss, our mind and body will react to this change. Something or someone that was there before is no longer there. Something or someone we depended on as part of our lives has gone. There has been a change. This can shake our world, and how it does so, will depend on what has happened and what support we have in place to cope. When we are bereaved, we can feel anxious, sad, angry, shocked, grief-stricken, withdrawn, in disbelief, guilty, sad and in denial – and experience these in no particular order. We can struggle with sleep, concentration, our appetite and making decisions. We can also experience physical pain, such as headaches and muscle pain, as well as less specific bodily reactions that are similar to feelings of anxiety. It is entirely normal to feel such intense feelings. It is a time of trying to make sense of the change our losses bring, whatever they are. It is about adjusting to our ‘new normal’. However, we also need to remember that when people are bereaved, their feelings are very challenging to bear, and sometimes they can feel intolerable. This can be a very difficult time. Viktor Frankl, who survived the unspeakable horrors of the concentration camps in Nazi Germany, said: When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves. Here are a few self-help suggestions that might help you with any difficult feelings you may be experiencing while adjusting to change, loss and bereavement: Allow yourself space to be with the feelings you are experiencing. Sometimes you may find it useful to talk with someone about your feelings, such as a phone call or video call with a friend, or sometimes you may just want to be alone with your feelings. There may also be times when writing down your feelings and thoughts or using music or art as an outlet is helpful too. Remind yourself that with any loss and change, difficult feelings will follow. For many people, the intensity of loss will diminish over time, but for others, it may not. It is important to work out how we remember the person who has died, and how we continue relating to their memory and what they meant to us, even though they are not with us any more in body. With other types of loss the feelings are likely, in time, to pass or to change. It might help to acknowledge that this is a time of adjustment. Allow yourself to let go of the thought that ‘everything will return to normal’, because it may not, but in time you will find a ‘new normal’. Henri Nouwen said ‘Hope is willing to leave unanswered questions and unknown futures unknown.’ Look after yourself physically. Try to get a good night’s sleep, you might want to read ourten top tips for good sleepfor this. Try to eat as healthily as possible, you may want to read ourdiet and mental health A-Z page. Include some daily exercise, but make sure that this is in line with the current government guidance, you may want to read ourHow to look after your mental health with exerciseguide. Some people find meditation, prayer, mindfulness or just being out in nature helpful. Sometimes giving to others or an act of kindness can help you feel better. Consider volunteering, delivering groceries or calling someone who might live alone. You may want to read ourrandom acts of kindnessblog for inspiration. Doing something that makes you feel good can often be a welcome distraction from thoughts and feelings that are challenging to shift. Try something new like drawing, making music, growing seeds, reading a book, or watching a movie with someone else. Be patient with others around you who may also be struggling with loss but express it differently. Remember that everyone experiences grief differently, and at different times and stages – this can include members of the same family group. If you have children be honest with them about your own feelings and name them. Help them name their own feelings and use age-appropriate language to explain a death. Consider doing a creative project alongside them that reflects how they are feeling. Help them to learn how to look after themselves. You may find this information from the charity Cruse useful, it talks aboutwhat you can do to help a child who is grieving. If your feelings become overwhelming as a result of your loss and they are stopping you from doing most of the self-help things above please seek further support from: If you have thoughts of not wanting to live anymore or have plans to take your own life then please call 999 (UK) or go to A&E and ask for the contact of the nearest crisis resolution team.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/dementia-rights-and-social-model-disability,"Dementia, rights, and the social model of disability","Viewingdementiaas a disability in terms of the social/rights-based model and the way in which people living with dementia are responded to has a range of implications. This paper describes the social model of disability in relation to dementia, as well as national and international law that is informed by it or that it connects with. It goes on to describe tools that can be used to apply the model through policy, practice, service and community development. Using the social model of disability has implications for the rights of people with dementia under the law, for disability discourse and public policy, and for how dementia is experienced and perceived by people with dementia and their carers, as well as how it is viewed and discussed in public. There are several implications for dementia policy and practice/services. In the social model, people with dementia are centre stage, with their voices elevated, and are recognised as equal citizens with rights. They are the agents of change and their agency is valued and recognised. They are part of mainstream society and the range of barriers (social, attitudinal, physical and environmental) that oppress and exclude them are broken down. They are also part of a broader social movement for global change. A current manifestation of the social model in practice is the development of dementia-friendly communities. Tools have been developed to enable the adoption of a rights-based approach and these can be effectively used in developing dementia policy and practice. However, moving towards a social model requires massive change at the micro and macro (individual, institutional and systemic) levels. There are many stakeholders involved and their roles in this model change significantly and a shift in the power dynamics is necessary. Societal change is also needed in the form of a shift from the current ‘medicalised’ perspective on dementia to one that is based on the principles of solidarity and inclusion. The debate has really only just started. Dementia isn’t just about memory loss. It can affect how you think, feel, speak and behave. Patricia, Diane and Deirdre tell their stories of living with dementia. We need to give much more consideration to the values we use when supporting and caring for people living with dementia, especially as they are a group that can be at high risk for developing wider mental health problems. Carers often have challenging decisions to make when a person is living with different realities and beliefs - something that increases as the dementia accelerates. Should they agree or contradict? What should they say? This report looks to provide guidance in these situations. There are no results that match your filtered options. Pleaseresetyour filters and try again.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/izzys-story-lack-representation-university,Izzy's story: lack of representation at university,"Making friends and building connections with people at university can look and feel different from person to person. We spoke to some students about their experience making connections at university and the things that impacted this. Izzy is a second year student at London School of Economics, here's what she has to say about her experience at university. One thing that was always on my mind when starting university was whether I would fit in.As a young Black woman, I thought I had prepared myself to be at this Predominantly White Institute (PWI). It was something that I was completely aware of - that I might not see many people who looked like me. Still, thinking of something and experiencing it are not the same. I still remember feeling disheartened when I walked into my Course Introduction and saw no one that looked like me. That sinking feeling would pop up each time I was in a study space and couldn’t see any other Black students, none of my lecturers either. At times, this would hinder my ability to make meaningful connections. I found myself feeling more self-conscious and out of place rather than focusing on the new people that I was meeting. Here is how I navigated these feelings. I found a society where I saw my culture, my music and myself being represented. For me, this was the African Caribbean Society (ACS). Spaces like these at my university brought Black students together. Many also had been feeling the same as I had. Being part of a community like this allowed me to relate to others and talk about our struggles at university. Together we made study spaces and attended events and while helping each other, we formed meaningful connections. Honestly, I’m so grateful for these connections that I’ve made. Being able to talk to people who understand how you feel and are going through it with you has been really beneficial to my mental health. Having had these conversations, I was in a better mindset to meet new people and build more meaningful connections. Looking back on my first year of university, here is some advice I would give to anyone who feels underrepresented at their university.

Making friends and building connections with people at university can look and feel different from person to person. We spoke to some students about their experience making connections at university and the things that impacted this. Holly is a recent graduate from the University of Lincoln, here's what she had to say about her experiences at university. Looking back at certain moments at university I can pinpoint times when I knew I was in the wrong place or around people that weren’t for me. I would almost feel a knot in my stomach that I could not shake, even if I attempted to convince my own mind over and over again that I was comfortable and happy here. There are plenty of times I wish I had listened to this voice instead of ignoring it, especially in environments and functions where alcohol was the main part of socialising. Although I was someone who was comfortable drinking socially, at times I wish I had been more selective in terms of who I chose to drink with socially. Being observant in my environment helped me to realise who I enjoyed and felt safe drinking around. Once I achieved this, this made life easier, as different people have different intentions. Building connections this way can determine the difference between making amazing memories with friends you will cherish for a lifetime, and having a memory you will want nothing more but to erase from your mind forever. Whether you are a social drinker or you don’t drink alcohol at all, always feel confident to put your feelings and preferences first, and known to those around you. There is a difference between doing things out of your comfort zone that will benefit you in the long term, and doing something you are uncomfortable with in order to ‘fit in’. If you are new to drinking or have no interest in drinking due to religion or lifestyle, you can still navigate your way around having fun at university this way. There can befeelings of lonelinessat any stage of university, but especially in the beginning. Although sticking to any group you find may seem like a quick and convenient solution to this, being selective is the best way to find like-minded people and develop quality bonds. You must remember not all company is good company, and friendship is something where quality over quantity is vital. Continuing to be yourself and participating in things you enjoy will naturally draw people with similar mindsets and values to you. There are plenty of activities, such as having picnics, going out for lunch and dinner/ society events, having mocktails as an alternative to alcoholic drinks, cinema, having movie nights and physical activities such as mini golf and go carting!

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/bellas-story-there-incredible-value-making-connections-new-people,The value in making connections with new people,"This content mentions anxiety, which some people may find triggering. Whilst it is easy to stick with our best friends, and comforting to be around the people that know us best, there is an incredible value in making connections with people that we may not typically surround ourselves with. During my main school years, I had a lot ofanxiety, particularly in social situations. After theCOVID-19 lockdowns, the anxiety was definitely heightened. This made it incredibly hard to get to know others outside of my ‘comfort circle,’ but I knew it was something I needed to do. I understood that creating relationships with other people would challenge my own worries but also allow me to extend my network of friends. Eventually, I was able to broaden my horizons and start speaking to others by trying to be kind and trustworthy as often as possible. I began to understand that there are loads of advantages to meeting new people and creating healthy relationships with your peers at school. At first, it was quite challenging to communicate with new people. One way I did it was by sitting next to new people in lessons. I found it too much to expose myself to new people at break and lunch as it was too overwhelming, but in lessons, it was a smaller group. As well as this in the lesson, I feel that you have more common ground and more stuff to talk about: homework or tests are all common connections between people in your class. I am so happy that I have gained these confidence skills, especially within myself and what I have to offer others. Some of the most interesting political discussions I’ve had were with people that weren’t necessarily my best friends. I’ve also found that the people who have supported me most through lessons and schoolwork are those I don’t necessarily chat with daily. I actually find that I can find something in common with everyone I speak to; it may not always be much, but it’s enough to make a connection. By being open to new relationships, I was able to have these experiences. Everyone has incredible attributes that they can bring to your life, whether it's humour, kindness (you can never have enough kindness in your life!), loyalty, or even just a new perspective and way of looking at things. Of course, it can be challenging to put yourself out there; these listening and communication skills take time to develop. They took plenty of time for me, but I got there! It's worth it to increase your support system and find new collaboration opportunities that you may have missed. Remember - you are with your peers for 5 or so years at secondary school, so these relationships are incredibly important!

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/judes-story-how-protect-your-self-esteem-when-new-situations,How to protect self-esteem when in new situations,"Do you ever feel self-conscious or that you are not being yourself when around unfamiliar people? You have made friends, yet you still feel as though you are struggling to fit in with this new group. While other people are thriving in this setting, you still feel like the odd one out. It is important to focus on being unique and celebrate this as being part of your individual journey, and see it as something that is not a permanent barrier but as something that could change. Healthy self-esteem is important for having healthy relationships, but especially for the relationship we have with ourselves. Our self-esteem can affect how we value ourselves, achieve our goals and interact with others. However, sometimes we can doubt ourselves and feel unworthy when we are around groups of people who may not necessarily be like us. At university, I was exposed to new groups of people that I would have never interacted with otherwise. This led me to feel like I was not identifying myself as part of the group and that because I may not have much in common with them, my experiences were less valid. The people I was meeting did not share the same background. However, it still felt like everyone had a link to each other, whether that was the type of school they went to or their interests, and this link did not extend to me. This left me feeling like I was undeserving of my place, and I also began to feel both academically and socially invalid. We all bring different things, and we all have a place, and our individuality should be upheld on our journeys. Self-esteem can affect how you view any setbacks, achievements, and social interactions. By developing healthy self-esteem, we can feel that what we bring to the table is enough and always will be! I think this is why self-esteem is an important part of having a healthy relationship with ourselves. Four ways I moved away from feeling invalid and rebuilt that much-needed healthy relationship from within: Encouraging myself to socialise allowed me to communicate openly about myself and feel important. It may surprise you how many people like to listen to your experiences, particularly if they are different from their own. Try to encourage yourself to try out different social activities or meet new groups of people. I found that socialising regularly helped me to communicate more openly about myself and to also feel important. It may surprise you how many people enjoy listening to your experiences, particularly if they are different from their own. Reflect on your journey to encourage self-acceptance which is important on the journey to self-love. I had to remind myself of my achievements and that I did get into this university on my own merit! Put simply, if I did not deserve to be here, then why was I here? Placing significance on my journey and seeing it as different but as one of many journeys allowed me to be at peace. You deserve to be proud of your achievements any and everywhere! Talking to people who can comfort you about what you are feeling is an effective way to reassure yourself of your situation. This is an essential tool to remind yourself that it is okay sometimes to find comfort in other people. I talked to friends who knew me and who happened to be going through the same experiences at their own universities. I realised that I was not alone and was then able to take pride in having a similar and shared experience with the people closest to me. Generating a healthy relationship with yourself and building self-esteem is not a linear process. It takes a lot of thought to understand what you are feeling and choose to grow as an individual, so take pride in your own experience and journey! Building resilience and not giving up was a great way to maximise my own potential in many aspects. If we do not push ourselves, we may never know how far we have come along our journey. The importance of having a healthy relationship with yourself will support you in any situation and it remains important to remind yourself exactly why you matter!

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/philips-story-finding-balance-life-and-my-friendships,Philip's story: finding balance in life and in my friendships,"In all aspects of life, balance is essential. From the food you eat to how you spend your time, it is important to find a healthy balance. The same is true for relationships of any and all natures. Love and respect are important for any relationship, where we can push each other to try our best. This is also true for relationships with ourselves! Hi, I am Phil (18). Finding a healthy balance is something that I have learned over time. To say my first year of secondary school was busy would be a considerable understatement. I would spend almost all of my free time exclusively working on homework or studying, and I even set myself projects to do off my own back. At the time, I thought I was doing what was expected of me, and I didn’t see too much of a problem with it. Talking to other people in my class, a task that took them 30 minutes to do, would take me two hours. Not because I didn’t understand the task, but because I spent so much time attempting to reach perfection. Looking back, I can see how my frame of mind was not healthy. I certainly enjoyed the praise I received, and said praise fueled my drive to reach perfection. At the end of the first year, I won the award for the most positive points in the year group. In year 8, things began to change. I started to see just how unbalanced my relationship with myself was. I continued to work hard, seeking perfection, but I was left largely unrewarded. A high standard of work was now expected from me by my teachers. I became completely exhausted. I remember one art project where I was given half of a picture, and I had to draw the other half in the same style. I completely broke down. I found the task incredibly difficult, but I came to realise that perfection was not always possible. And that is okay. From that point onwards, my outlook changed. I balanced my time so that I could enjoy both my studies and new hobbies, such as learning to code in several languages, railway modelling and flight simulation. Ultimately, I enjoyed my time in school more! This remained true throughout my A-Level studies, and I hope it will be true when it comes to my university studies. I still work hard, and I can still be hard on myself at times, but not as much as I was before. Being able to reflect on our work or actions, can be helpful. It can be good to challenge ourselves as long as we treat ourselves with kindness and respect. In talking to other people, I have found that people find balance in different ways. I moved away from the mindset that I had to compete with everyone, it's more about doing what I need to do, for myself, to thrive and be happy. I learned to become my own cheerleader. Being able to find your own balance can help to improve your relationship with yourself, and with other people.

Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. Grant Blair turned his life around with a new found passion for running and has recently completed the ‘Virtual Edinburgh Marathon Challenge’. Mental health has affected Grant, and his family all his life and he has felt that it has run through the generations. His grandmother was diagnosed withschizophreniaand his mother was diagnosed withbipolarand Grant himself has struggled withanxietyanddepressionfor extended periods throughout his life. Grant lived a very unhealthy lifestyle for 19 years. Weekends would be spent partying and regularly going days without sleep. But the party did end, and after years of abusing drugs and alcohol, Grant reached a point where he wanted to die. Thankfully he sought support and went to a faith-based rehabilitation centre for men in the Scottish Borders. He spent 17 months there and with support was able to deal with his problems and was able to turn his life round, for the better. It was around this time that he discovered his passion for running and credits running for dramatically improving his mental health and now believes that exercise is the best anti-depressant available to us all. Grant had taken part in a few races but had never attempted a marathon, so was excited to sign up for theEdinburgh Marathon 2020and was looking forward to the atmosphere and buzz on the day and was disappointed when the event had to be cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Grant was delighted to hear that the Edinburgh Marathon organisers were offering participants the opportunity to complete the distance and take part in the first-ever Virtual Edinburgh Marathon Festival. Not wanting to waste all the hard work and effort he had already put into his training, it was all systems go and he completed the 26.2-mile distance in 3 hours and 33 minutes! “I enjoyed running it virtually, as I could complete the distance at a time that suited me and I liked the fact that people could do it in one go, or break it up. I also received a Finishers Pack, which includes a medal and T-shirt, which was a lovely touch and made me feel a real sense of achievement – I would highly recommend that other runners take part and support the work of the Mental Health Foundation – the more you challenge yourself, the better you become.” - Grant If you are feeling like ending your life or feel unable to keep yourself safe, please call 999 or go to A&E and ask for the contact of the nearest crisis resolution team.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/articles/talking-children-about-scary-world-events,Talking to children about scary world events,"News is everywhere. In the digital age, it is no longer possible to control the news we are exposed to or shield children from upsetting information. What you can do is help to minimise the negative impact it has on your children. You can do this through open and honest conversations at home, using the tips below: The important thing here is balance. Force-feeding children news or going to great lengths to shield them from it can be unhelpful. Avoid turning the television off or closing web pages when they come into the room. This can pique their interest to find out what’s really going on – and that is when their imagination can take over. Children are very likely to get a sense of the uncertainty or fear around what's going on, even if they’re not old enough to understand or hear about exactly what’s happening. Be careful that they don’t overhear conversations about your fears. Children pick up more than we realise and may misinterpret or keep their feelings hidden from us. Children may feel overwhelmed by things they’ve heard on the news, on social media or from their friends. If they are given clear and honest explanations of what is happening and know that it is okay to talk about scary or tricky subjects, it can give them the confidence to ask about them. Encourage your children to come to you with questions about what's happening. If you don’t have the answers, be honest. Try reading or watching reputable news sources together that you have already looked at or share the news at the moment by explaining what is happening verbally in an unbiased way. Give them practical tips on looking after themselves and others, explaining the importance of open communication,healthy relationships, andways to cope with stress. It’s also a good opportunity to talk aboutthe benefits of kindness. Small doses of real-life news are really helpful. Large doses can have a negative effect as children can become fixated on a news story and repeatedly look at news coverage relating to it. To avoid overexposure, encourage them to discuss the news story with you once they have read about it. This provides a safe space for all of their questions. All children, even teenagers, want to know their parents can keep them safe. The best way to communicate safety is by talking about worrying news with open, confident, clear and truthful facts. Go through all the reasons that mean they are in a safe place rather than well-meaningly dismissing their feelings by telling them everything is fine. Reassure them that you will look after them and do your best to keep them safe. They may be worried about who will look after you if something happens, so tell them about the support you have in place. Try telling them that you also find events like this worrying. Let them know that you can balance these worries with the reality of them coming true. You would want them to leave this conversation realising that although bad things can happen, they don’t happen very often, so they do not need to be scared all the time. Explain to your child what it means to be vulnerable. Vulnerability is not weakness. It's a natural response to experiencing uncertainty and risk and being emotionally exposed. You may feel vulnerable as a parent or carer in this conversation with your child. Try to acknowledge this and offer them lots of time for discussion and support from you. You can also use this as an opportunity to teach children to grow into responsible citizens. Abiding by restrictions and laws means understanding that there is something bigger than individuals and that we should protect each other. All children have different temperaments and sensitivities. Their ability to understand the world and take in and react to bad news will depend on their age. If you have more than one child, you might want to talk about the news with them individually and tailor what you say to their needs and level. It may be that your child starts asking questions about a news event at an inconvenient time. In this case, let them know you have heard them and think what they are asking is important. Tell them that you would like to talk with them about it later and invite them to remind you, so they know you really are interested. It's common for children to have misunderstandings about traumatic events. Children tend to make up what they don’t know, which is often worse than reality. Encouraging them to ask lots of questions is important as it allows space for a truthful and open explanation to help correct these. Remember that children tend to repeat themselves when they are feeling uncertain or worried. They may need to ask the same question a number of times until they feel more reassured. When children ask a direct or tricky question, it can be tempting to avoid it by bending the truth. This can be unhelpful when they are talking to others about what happened. It's often more helpful to be as honest as possible. This is also true of questions when you don’t know the answer. Remember that it is okay not to know or to go away and find out and get back to them.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/stephs-story-overcoming-my-fear-and-anxiety-skydive-mental-health-awareness-week,Overcoming my fear and anxiety with a skydive,"This content mentions anxiety, depression and panic attacks, which some people may find triggering. On 14 May 2022, I threw myself out of a plane! Actually, I was securely strapped to a qualified instructor who I put my complete faith in that they knew what they were doing! So why did I do this? For many years now I have lived withdepressionandanxiety. Depression has a habit of sneaking up when things start to get on top of me. It only takes a few triggers, and I can be sent into a tailspin. Thankfully, this doesn't happen too frequently, but when it does, it’s hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel. But from experience, I have found that there always is. Anxiety, however, plagues me on a daily basis. The analogy of the devil and angel on your shoulder is a pretty good way to sum up my internal dialogue. That little devil is always chattering about things that could go wrong and likes to point out my faults and failures. He reminds me regularly of all the things I am not good at and tells me I can't do things because I am afraid. When I think about it, I am afraid of a lot. Dying, flying, heights, small spaces, crowds, failure, sprouting eyes on potatoes... the list goes on! The worst thing is these fears stop me from having great experiences. I would avoid a trip to London for fear of having apanic attackon the train. Trips anywhere that involve trains and tunnels are avoided unless absolutely essential and have to be strategically planned to avoid busy periods. And as for planes, plummeting from the sky in a confined space with no means of escape, packed in with loads of people, is enough to send me running for the hills! I purposely haven't renewed my passport, which expired ten years ago, so I won’t be able to get on a plane. I would LOVE to go to a festival, but never have because I am afraid of crowds. At the start of the year, I decided that 2022 was the year I was going to stop being afraid. I am going to face my fears head-on! And what better way to tackle a lot of my fears in one than to do a skydive! I am also hoping that by doing this, I will also give other people who suffer the courage to face their fears too. The skydive was petrifying and exhilarating all in one go! There were moments of pure terror combined with sheer excitement and adrenaline. I don't think I could ever top that experience, but now I know that whenever I am floundering or thinking I can't do something - I will think back to the day when I threw myself out of a plane and know that I could do anything if I put my mind to it. And, of course, I wanted to raise lots of money for the Mental Health Foundation, which does so much work around raising mental health awareness and prevention. So far, I have raised £1420 for the Foundation. Thank you to everyone that has donated and supported me through this truly life-changing event!

YoungMinds has information onhow to have a more positive experience online. Find time regularly to connect with friends, family, classmates, co-workers or others. It can help you all feel more connected. Trydifferent ways of keeping in touch to find the ones that work best (e.g. video calls, quizzes or games with friends). If you use video calls for work or study, you might want to try something else for socialising: an online watch party where you all stream the same film and chat together, for example, or simply a phone call. Try to find a routine that is realistic, flexible, and includes some fun. There are many ways to do this, so experiment with what works best for you.  The proper routine for you might look different from someone else’s, and that’s okay! Trypicking three things to do daily, breaking your day into chunks, or planning regular mealtimes and bedtimes. If we’re unable to exercise in the ways we prefer, we may not be as active as we usually would – which is important for our mental health. Try to include movement and activity in your routine in whatever way works best for you. Be as understanding of yourself as you are to a friend, especially if you’re finding things difficult or your plans have had to change. Being compassionate towards others, and helping them if you’re able, can make you both feel good. Remember that we all may struggle in different ways, and being compassionate towards others can go a long way. Make sure you're in contact with your therapist or other mental health professionals by phone, video call or email. Many organisations offer practical tips for managing your mental health. This includes: There are also helplines and chatrooms such asThe Sanctuary,Papyrus,CALMandSamaritans. Being at school, college or university can bring particular worries or challenges. Here are some suggestions for managing as a student or school leaver. It can be helpful to study with others to boost your motivation. Tryorganising online study groups with your friends or classmates where you discuss questions about assignments or share tips on studying from home, or watchvlogsfor motivation. If you were hoping to start an apprenticeship or enter the job market, you might face uncertainty about your future. Organisations such asThe Skills ToolkitandFuture Learnoffer free online courses in various subjects if you fancy learning something new. They might be a helpful way to stay motivated in this period of uncertainty. Be honest with your teachers about how you’re feeling and how they can help you learn better from home. Your teacher or lecturer may also know of other support available for you. You could try suggesting new resources or ways of communicating online that your teacher might not be aware of. If your teacher or lecturer doesn’t get back to you, find out who your course administrator is to use as a second point of contact. Keep a record of important communications with school staff, especially when discussing coursework, dissertation or deadlines. These are uncertain times, and things like exam marks, university, job or apprenticeship offers, and what the world will look like in a few months can all add to feelings of anxiety. It can feel scary and overwhelming when we don’t know what will happen, and much of it will be out of our control. Identifying the things you have control over and those you don't can help make this feel a bit more manageable. You could try aCircle of Controlexercise, where you think about what’s stressing you out and write down the things you have no control over, the things you can influence, and the things you can control. We feel more anxious when we focus on the things we can’t control and forget about the things we can. We’ve gone through so many changes to daily life in the last few years and life is still far from easy for a lot of us. It may not be realistic to expect yourself to be as productive as you were before. If you find yourself feeling a bit unmotivated, or you haven’t got as much done in a day as you usually would, that’s okay. Focus on making a plan that feels as manageable for you as you are. There is support available. Your university or the building manager of your private halls should have a procedure in place to make sure you have a way to receive food and medicines you need. Be sure to tell your tutor or student representative that you’re staying in your accommodation. Many university mental health services have moved online, and have temporarily removed the requirement to be referred by your GP. If you feel that it would help to talk to someone, have a look at your university mental health service webpage. If you’re an international student,take a look at the advice from UKCISA. If you witness or experience discrimination or racism, please report it. Racist incidents against migrants and international students have increased since the COVID-19 outbreak. Regardless of what’s going on in the world, racism is never ok. Report any incident to yourlocal police. Support is available from theVictim Support (for Wales and England)Victim Support in Scotland,Victim Support if you live in NIorStop Hatehelplines. If you’re worried about your finances, you can find guidance from theStudent Loans Company (England, Wales and NI)orStudent Information Scotland. If you attend university, your university may offer grants from  a hardship fund which you usually don’t have to pay back. Search on your university’s website for information on hardship funds or contact the Student Advice Team (or equivalent). Information is also available fromOffice for StudentsandStudent Mind. The Mental Health Foundation is committed to bringing readers reliable and relevant information. All of our pages are written and regularly reviewed by our mental health experts, in line with official advice on the coronavirus outbreak. If you want to develop a personalised plan for supporting your mental health you can visit theEvery Mind Matters site, developed in collaboration with the Mental Health Foundation.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/articles/looking-after-your-mental-health-teacher,Looking after your mental health as a teacher,"Think about what helps lift your mood and gets you through stress, and plan extra time to do that. Whether it’s exercise, safe face-to-face or virtual time with friends, or protected time with family, try not to let these things go or sacrifice them. Try and keep the basics going as much as you can – eating as well as you can, getting enough sleep and watching your caffeine and alcohol intake. Give yourself small rewards. Identify a group of people you can be honest and open with about your feelings. Partners, friends, or close colleagues will want to help, and mixing the group up means you can ask different people for different things. If you can have a conversation with your manager or senior team about your worries, it might help them to understand and be part of your support team. If you can encourage the staff team to adopt the same messages or nurturing and reconnection, you’ll be doing with students, it can really help. Remember, this is a period of adjustment for everyone. You aren’t a superhero; you are one single professional in an unprecedented period of change. The rules will change, and the school community will learn and adapt, but only you can control the circumstances in your classroom today. Try to keep in touch with how you feel and what, if anything, is a particular issue for you. Try and find a distraction technique to get you through difficult times. It might be headphones on the way in, a podcast in the car, or just five minutes of peace at lunch or break to do a meditation track or have a moment of fresh air. Don't judge others’ reactions too harshly – people have their own reasons, motivations and fears to contend with that we’re not aware of. Keep a note of things you’re grateful for and things you’ve learned each day. You do this job for a reason – and why teaching and working with young people is so appealing may be even more important now, even though the challenges are tough.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/articles/coping-scary-world-events-if-you-already-have-mental-health-problems,Coping with scary world events if you already have mental health problems,"Scary world events may be especially challenging for those of us with mental health problems – wherever we are on that journey. If we are currently struggling, we may find it harder to get support, and if we manage well most of the time, it might be harder to follow our usual ways of coping. It’s important to be aware of how we are doing daily and weekly. Early recognition of any bumps can make getting back on track easier. Many of us can cope well and use skills we’ve learned through experience and support to manage this crisis. It’s important that we don’t assume that everyone with mental health issues is vulnerable or unable to cope, which can be damaging and lean into stigma. If you are finding it hard to cope right now, please seea list of helplines and resources to get help. Many tips are often shared, many of which are helpful for those with mental health problems. Some suggestions can also seem overwhelming or out of reach - financially or socially. Things like taking on new hobbies, cooking new things or paying for expensive deliveries or subscriptions. Some advice can seem more aimed at people who don’t usually struggle with mental health so it might seem simple or just not intended for us. The ideas below are intended as a start for you to consider, try out and ultimately, take or leave according to what you find works for you. Whatever we can manage, and feels OK, is good enough. Eating, sleeping, moving (either inside or outside) and making sure we keep hydrated are the building blocks of life and are important to our mental health – but they can sometimes seem overwhelming. If you can keep your routine or establish a new one, it may be easier to keep well. This is not easy to do. Writing down a new routine may help at first. It’s hard to ask for help, and it can be hard to believe that we are worthy of people’s time. It can also be hard to believe that we have things to offer. We are worthy of support. Try to be kind to yourself. Self-compassion is always important – though it may be challenging, especially when trying to make it a habit. Health services such as your GP and pharmacy always help, even under pressure, whether it’s with your mental or physical health. Don’t suffer in silence or ignore early warning signs – responding to them might prevent a crisis. Mental health staff face the same pressures as other NHS teams, managing staff absence and new ways of working. Even so, they are still there. Try to ask for what you need, if you can. If you are unable to explain difficulties, see if a friend or family member can help, or try writing it down. If things need to change and that's difficult for you, give the new way a chance – it might be OK. Speak with your pharmacist or GP about prescriptions and blood tests. If you have to speak with other agencies, such as the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), your landlord or banks, remember you can get advice about your rights from various sources. A circle of support is a group of people and tools you gather when times are hard. This may be practical or emotional support, such as someone to look after you or your pet if you are unwell, someone who could do your shopping if you feel unable to, or a friend to text you each morning to check if you are up. A circle of support can be in person or through digital channels. Most of us need a balance of time between ourselves and being with others. Being forced on our own can be damaging, and connecting with others is important to our mental health. Connecting with people online or on the phone can be helpful but also overwhelming or confusing. It can take time to figure out how different apps or online tools work and which ones (if any) are right for you. Perhaps you’ve always known the value of online communities and can rely on peer support from online friends. If you have skills you could share, then consider doing that if you can. If you’ve experienced mental health issues, there’s a chance you’ve gone through periods where you’ve been isolated, withdrawn or challenged. You might have surprised yourself in the past with what you’ve been able to cope with, even when it seemed too awful to contemplate. Remember those times and use that experience. You may have a plan or even a 'toolbox' you know can help when things are hard. If you don’t and are feeling well now, this might be a good time to gather some things together. You could include relaxation soundtracks or breathing exercises, diversions like colouring, music or video games, or doing something creative. You could even build a den or safe space in your home. There are a lot of free online events – theatre, virtual tours of museums and similar – so you may find something that interests you. Try to do something nice for yourself every day and celebrate small wins – even if it’s as simple as washing your hair or going outside for a walk. It can be hard to express our feelings when times are hard. Getting it out can be helpful – whether we share or not. You could keep a private journal or blog, carry a notebook or use social media or creative arts. Writing down your thoughts and emotions can help a lot. It’s great if you have people you can confide in, but even if you don’t, writing things down to revisit can really help. Some people find it helps to note things they are grateful for or learned, however small. If you use social media or blogs, make sure you remember to check your privacy settings and think through how comfortable you are about sharing before you post. Watching, reading or listening to the news may add to our worries, where we chew over every thought. It might help to try just one news bulletin a day, switch it off and do other things. Many of us have past things that affect how we live our lives now. Many of us also worry about how the future will pan out. Both are important in understanding our lives and planning, but it may be helpful to try and live in the present. Take it one day at a time, if you can. That means respecting the past and what it means but passing each minute, hour and day as a new opportunity. If we can work to forgive ourselves and take care of ourselves, it will help. If you are feeling well, there may be things you can do in the community to help out - especially if you are at home. Walking neighbourhood dogs, helping to deliver food or volunteering for local community initiatives can be great ways to give back. 24th Oct 2025

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/lukes-story-binge-eating-depression-and-how-my-obsession-fitness-wasnt-necessarily-good-thing,"Binge eating, depression and obsession with fitness","This content mentions substance abuse and addiction (which may include mentions of alcohol or drug use), body image and depression, which some people may find triggering. Luke talks here about binge eating, body image and depression and how an obsession with fitness and diving into some tough endurance challenges isn't necessarily a good thing. Staring at the bottom of a now empty tub of ice cream, I promised myself, this would be the last time! I hid behind closed doors during my late-night binge-eating sessions. Hiding removed me from the rest of the world, as I regularly overfed myself to experience a fleeting state of comfort. Sitting on my bed with headphones hugging my ears, I watched endless videos on YouTube, distracting me from the violent negative internal voices vying for my attention. As the sun rose, with its rays piercing through the curtains, I would remove my headphones, and start my day - acting as if the night before never happened. What compounded the flood of negative emotions I had each night, was the fact that I felt like (and was) living a double life. By day, I was paid to work with individuals and teams to not only help improve their physical performance but also, live a well-rounded, healthy life. I worked with people who wanted to lose weight, run marathons (and even ultra-marathons) or complete some other physical challenge they set themselves. I had clients who struggled to get out of their own way and accomplish their professional and personal goals, and I helped out in various ways. However, most nights, I was doing the complete opposite of what I prescribed to the people I worked with. I battled for years with the feeling of being a fraud and living this painful double life. To subdue this all-encompassing feeling, while at the same time, doing my best to ignore it, I took on and created some of the world’s toughest endurance challenges. From running 65 kilometres down Mount Everest, to running across the Sahara desert. I cycled 412 kilometres non-stop from London to Newquay in 18 hours - just to learn how to surf! I ran across a tropical forest in China, without any food, water, phone, or money, and with a plane to catch (but that's another story). I even completed a double Ironman triathlon in north Wales (aptly named The Double Brutal Extreme Triathlon), taking me 35 non-stop hours, before creating and completing a world-first, 2000 kilometres in a 12-day, Ultimate Triathlon from Morocco to Monaco. Some people will turn toalcohol, others todrugsorgamblingwhen dealing withdepression. For me, I became addicted toexercise, and not in a healthy way. Midnight marathons (literally running 40+ kilometres starting at midnight), eight-hour bike rides every weekend and fitting in as much swimming, cycling, running, and weight lifting as I could, around my clients and keynote speaking business. If I binged on ice cream and bread one night, I’d then go run for five hours the next. If I binged one afternoon then I wouldn’t eat dinner that night, or breakfast the next day. While making sure I filled that day with three, four or even five hours of exercise. The cycle was never-ending, as I was chasing something that wasn’t there to be caught - my happiness. It’s easy to hide being addicted to exercise because anyone can dress up like a wolf in sheep’s clothing. Exercising is healthy, if it’s done every day, then it must not only be healthy but by making the body fit and strong! While all of the above is true, too much exercise isn’t a good thing. Combined with binge eating,insomniaand depression, it’s a recipe for disaster! My addiction to exercise was a distraction from what was really going on in my life. I was literally running away from the real issue. I had changed careers and was lost. I lacked an identity, daily values as a human, and a direction in my life. The pain I felt due to this career change, carved out a canyon inside of me, which filled up with depression, insomnia, binge eating, and twice standing on tops of bridges not wanting to live for another second. I was ashamed of how I felt, and the actions I took, and that a man in his late twenties moving into his thirties couldn’t just ‘shake off’ what he was going through. My binge eating and insomnia fed my depression. However, at the same time, I used binge eating to help me cope with my depressive states. My depression was the reason I would binge and my inability to fall asleep. I was struggling to survive and completely lost in this destructive cycle. It took me four years of battling depression before I externalised it to anyone. And another three before I opened up to my friends and family. That's seven years of my life I battled with my mental health, and barely survived the double life I was leading. I remember waking up one day and realising something needed to change. If I was to stop living this double life, I needed to get help. With that thought, I had a choice to make. I could open up to someone I loved, and who loved me. Or, I could open up as little or as much of what I was going through to a stranger, and go from there. I chose the latter, and after several years oftherapy, and meeting this stranger on a weekly basis, I felt the internal strength to share what I had and was going through with those closest to me. To this day, it was the most rewarding and impactful thing I’ve ever done for myself. Allowing those people who truly care and love me to know the pain I was going through, filled me with a level of courage and support I never knew existed. I stopped living the double life I had led and started living my own life, one day at a time. These days I'm not hiding behind closed doors or ashamed of my past behaviour, but sharing my experiences to help others find their own internal strength, hoping they too will one day feel comfortable enough to speak up about what they are going through - whether that’s with a stranger or a loved one.

It may also be hard to escape to places where you feel safer, more supported and better able to seek help. Try to stick to a daily routine that supports your mental and physical health. Going outdoors for a walk, running, or shopping will give you a break from the other person and could be a chance to seek help. If your internet browsing history is not being monitored, it might be helpful to join online discussion forums. Women’s Aid has aSurvivors’ Forumfor women affected by domestic abuse. Or you could join a group on completely different topics, for example, music, local action to help people affected by the coronavirus, or other interests you may have. Women’s Aidhas more advice and resources for anyone living with an abusive person. If you are in immediate danger, call the police or an ambulance on 999. If you cannot talk on the phone, call 999 and press 55. This will transfer your call to the relevant police force, who will assist you without you having to speak. If possible, use technology such as phone, email or messaging apps to stay in daily (or more frequent) touch with people who know about your situation. This will help you stay connected, show the abuser that other people know how you are (if it’s safe to let them know you’re in touch with people), and may alert others if they don't hear from you. Some local pharmacies provideSafe Spaces– consultation rooms you can use to safely speak to friends and family or find details of specialist domestic abuse support. Other pharmacies may have an ‘Ask for ANI’ poster on display. If you ask a staff member for ANI, they will take you to a private consultation room where you can access help. Many of these services also offer help by email and webchat if it’s safer or easier for you to use those. 24th Oct 2025

Almost one third of adults (31%) in the UK felt anxious in the last month due to their financial situation. That’s what our recent poll in November 2023 has told us. It also tells us that more than one quarter (27%) felt stressed and almost one in ten (9%) felt hopeless. This shows that things haven’t improved since ourlast report in November 2022.  We’ve been living with the cost-of-living crisis for more than a year, and people continue to struggle with essential living costs and the mental health impact of money worries. This is particularly worrying as we know that if people feel anxious or stressed over a long period of time, it’s more likely they will develop more severe mental health problems. We need our government to take more action to lessen the financial pressure people are experiencing, to prevent them from developing poor mental health. We also need government to make sure their decisions benefit people’s mental health, especially those most at risk of financial strain. Our report gives an overview of the current and likely effects the cost-of-living crisis has on people’s mental health. We cannot ignore the potentially devastating impact the cost-of-living crisis has on mental health. Our research has shown that during the cost-of-living crisis people are doing less of the things that are good for our mental health. These statistics are from ourNovember 2023 survey.

We hope you find these perspectives helpful, but some content can make us think about our own needs. If anything you see leaves you feeling low or worried,you canfind ways to get helphere. Further down the page, you can hear more in-depth thoughts from the OPEN members featured in this joint video. Ajay lives in South West London with his wife and two grown-up children. Family life is very important to him. Ajay was diagnosed with cancer four years ago. He retired early due to work stress during the pandemic. His wife is also retired. They are living off savings and investments until they can claim their pensions. Bella lives in South West Wales with her dog. She has three children, who have grown up and left home, and three grandchildren, who are very important in her life. She is currently in her final year studying criminology. Bella has struggled with money for some time and is currently appealing a Personal Independence Payment (PIP) decision. Kira is a student living in student halls in Gloucester. They study Occupational Therapy, work as a support worker and were care-experienced as a youth. Mike lives in North London with his landlady and her son. He does youth and community work on a self-employed basis and is passionate about helping others. His interest in mental health stems from his own lived experience. Mike's rent has recently increased, and he is feeling the impact of the rising cost-of-living. The cost-of-living crisis is affecting us all. We offer a variety of resources to help support you through these challenging times. Our Personal Experience Network (OPEN) is a diverse online community of people we ask to inform what we do, from quick feedback on a social media post to fully participating in a research project. Many of us are facing new worries because of the cost-of-living crisis. If you’re having a hard time with things and it seems like there’s nothing anyone can do to help, there are ways that the government or organisations can help and guide you through these difficult times. Worrying about bills and the cost of food, on top of our usual daily stresses, can make it hard to find the time to look after yourself. But even when there's so much going on, it’s important to find time to protect your well-being and mental health. 24th Oct 2025

We recorded this episode in early September 2020 when for many of us, we had been seeing a gradual easing of lockdown, children heading back to school, students back to uni and some people heading back to work. For some people this brought longed-for opportunities. But for many, even the happy, much anticipated changes were difficult for our mental health. And lastly, we are still far from knowing what the pandemic means for our society moving forward... So, on the show we want to explore these big themes – and Bethan has some great guests to help her tackle them. Firstly, she will be speaking to, Suba, a junior doctor who has been working in the Emergency Department of an NHS hospital in London during the coronavirus outbreak. Then Dr David Crepaz-Keay, who is the Head of Applied Learning at the Foundation. He will talk us through what has been happening with mental health in the UK during the coronavirus pandemic.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/face-fear,In the face of fear,"This content mentions anxiety, panic attacks, depression and trauma, which some people may find triggering. Fear is arguably our most powerful emotion. It is critically important in dictating how we think, feel and behave. Like all the basic emotions, it has evolved to ensure our survival and protects us from all sorts of harm. But it can also cause us harm. It can harm our health and wellbeing, relationships, capacity for learning, community involvement and life-chances. It can also lead us to act in ways that, although intended to be geared towards self-protection and survival, may harm our loved ones, neighbours, fellow citizens and perceived enemies. Research carried out for this report suggests that we are becoming more fearful as a nation. Our survey emphatically indicates that people perceive our world as having become more frightening and frightened. The Government’s Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys, published in February 2009, show significant increases in anxiety disorders between 1993 and 2007. We believe these trends are linked. The more fearful people feel in the general population, the more people will be tipped over into diagnosable anxiety disorders. These findings deserve attention, not just because fear and the perception of fear have such wide-ranging costs and are factors in so much personal and collective suffering, but because there are concrete measures we can take to counter them. Much of our fear is not inevitable. Fear is a feature of nearly all clinical mental health problems and is a root cause of some of the most common ones. As well asanxietydisorders themselves, fear is strongly associated withdepression,psychosis, and attemptingsuicidein the past year. Fear is also strongly linked to poorphysical health. People with generalised anxiety disorder have been found to be at higher risk of coronary heart disease, while anxiety has been linked to increased incidence of gastrointestinal problems, arthritis, migraine, allergies, thyroid disease and chronic respiratory disorders such as asthma. People with anxiety disorders are four times as likely as others to develop high blood pressure, and many studies have shown a relationship between anxiety and reduced white blood cell function, a sign of immune system weakness. There is also emerging evidence of a link between stress and Alzheimer’s Disease. Anxiety is also associated with unhealthy lifestyle choices such assmoking,drinking too much alcohol, and poordiet. Many authors writing about rising fear and anxiety have been quick to point out the relative safety in which the majority of the UK population has lived since the Second World War. Despite the evidence that most of us are prey to far fewer immediate threats to our health and safety in the form of disease, war, destitution and other forms of suffering than in many previous eras, our experience of fear, which evolved to alert us to such threats, is reported as growing (indeed, in our survey, 60% of people say there is increased fear because the world has become a more dangerous place). For example: fear of crime continues to rise, even though crime itself has fallen in the last decade. Many parents are nervous about allowing their children outside on their own, but they are more likely to be involved in a serious accident while at home, as well as being more prone to physical and mental ill-health through lack of exercise. While our cultural environment is important, we would find things to fear whatever environment we were in. This is because fear is part of our genetic inheritance and we can’t eliminate it. We need to be aware of it, live with it, manage it, and live in spite of it. If you feel affected by the content you have read, please see ourget helppage for support.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/articles/getting-back-routine-after-time-away,Getting back into a routine after time away,"This content mentions anxiety, which some people may find triggering. Returning to work or your 'normal' routine after time away, for example, after personal leave or a sabbatical, may bring up strong feelings for you - fear, worry, confusion, relief, or a mixture of different emotions. You might be glad to be back but worry about how things might have changed. This may also apply if you or your loved ones are vulnerable or have mental health concerns. You might not feel ready to return to everything you enjoyed before, such as going to the cinema or pub, mixing with groups, or travelling by public transport. It will take time to find your way back and reconnect with life. Don’t be hard on yourself if it’s taking longer than you expected. Ourmental health tipsabout finding routines, staying connected, eating well and keeping active may help you adapt to changes. Fear and anxiety are common emotional responses to change. It’s important to make space for your feelings rather than push them away. Only by building tolerance gently can we move through these fears. Control what can be controlled.There are many things you can’t control that cause you fear and anxiety – but there are some things you can manage or plan for. Having an action plan for managing things you might find difficult can help. Pace yourself.You need to go at the right pace for yourself. Don’t let others bully or pressure you into doing things you don’t want to – but try not to let that be an excuse not to push yourself, especially when reconnecting with friends. Talk about your concerns with those close to you, and allow others to move at their own pace. Build up your tolerance.Try doing something that gently challenges you every day or every few days. Don’t worry if it doesn’t go well but keep at it. Keep a note of things you’ve achieved, enjoyed or surprised yourself doing. Vary your routines.Mix things up, so you see different people and encounter different situations. If one cafe is too crowded and makes you nervous, try another. If a walk at one time of the day is very busy, try mixing walks at busy times with walks at quieter times. Talk to your employer.Many workplaces are allowing more flexible working. If you’re finding it hard to get to work, or do particular shifts or activities because of anxiety or fear, speak to your manager, HR or a colleague you trust if that feels right. If you have a long-term mental health problem, you may be entitled to reasonable adjustments as a disabled person under the Equality Act. Even if you haven’t disclosed a mental health problem before, you might benefit from doing so now if it feels safe. Focus on the present.You can only do your best with what you have today. Try and keep focused on the moment. Mindfulness meditation is one way of returning your mind to the present moment. Focus on what’s certain.While many things are uncertain, there are also things to be hopeful about. Try to notice and appreciate good things as they happen, and take opportunities to reset and relax. Talk to people you trust.It’s important to talk about how you feel. Don’t dismiss your concerns or judge yourself too harshly. You may be able to find your tribe online, but try and get outside perspectives too. You may start picking up more of your social life again – perhaps because you want to, or maybe you feel pressured by others who are excited to get things back to normal. Reconnecting with people may initially feel awkward. Whether it’s feeling uncomfortable physically being around people again, or feeling odd in large groups, take things at your own pace. You can decide on what suits your circumstances or vulnerabilities best. If you’re in a vulnerable group, you may feel more isolated and unsure of how to start doing the things you miss again. Friends and family may not be able to relate and offer support. Try to find people who do understand what you’re going through, or – if you feel able to – talk to someone you trust about feeling left out. Ask them to find ways to include you that you feel comfortable with. If you’re a parent or carer returning to the workplace, you may welcome the change between work and home – but it may also prove challenging emotionally.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/articles/nurturing-our-relationships-during-challenging-times,Nurturing our relationships during challenging times,"There are always going to be challenges that affect our lives, including our relationships with family, friends, colleagues and others. We can feel nervous about visiting or being visited by loved ones, visiting shops, gyms or cafes, or even leaving our homes. This may be particularly true if we have a disability or long-term health conditions. Losing contact with people can be stressful, worrying, frightening, or even unbearable. Not having enough contact can leave us feeling lonely and alone with our problems. We never know everything going on in someone's life and we all face challenges and difficulties. It’s worth trying to be patient and understanding with each other and ourselves. Ourtop tips for nurturing healthy relationshipscan make a big difference and are as relevant and important during good times as challenging times: During difficult times, it’s worth thinking about extra ways to protect our relationships and try to cope better with some of the relationship problems life's challenges can create. Stay in touch however you can, whether through phone calls, emails, text messages or letters, for example. Hearing a familiar voice or reading a message from people we care about helps us feel more connected. This is important for our mental health, especially for people living alone who may feel lonely, isolated and afraid. We don’t all feel confident or comfortable with video apps like FaceTime, Skype, Zoom and WhatsApp, but seeing a friendly face can help us feel more connected. This is a time when younger people can help older relatives, friends and neighbours to use the internet and enjoy some ways it can help us stay connected with each other and the wider world. Age UK has a usefulguide to making video calls with different apps. If you want to make new connections with other people, online communities can be ideal for this. They can be extremely supportive, although it’s worth remembering they are not always safe places. There are a vast number of online communities out there. You’ll find everything from general interest communities likeMumsnetto more specialist communities focused on, for instance, football, health conditions, fitness, politics, local areas, cookery, relationships and rock music. Mind’s Side by Sideis a supportive community where you can talk about your mental health. We also give you some suggestions aboutpeer support. Getting involved in local efforts to support vulnerable people is good for helpers and those they’re supporting. For example, you can join a local mutual aid group or volunteer as a telephone befriender for the Silver Line. Contact local groups or charities you care about to see their opportunities. Find out more about the joy and inspiration that can be gained from helping people in our communities and beyond throughrandom acts of kindness. Living with other people makes it easy to feel irritated or overwhelmed if you get in each other's way. It can help to agree on who is going to use which parts of the home and when especially if you need to work and/or look after children. Make the best use of the physical space you have. This can mean planning your day, discussing how to share communal rooms, being aware of others’ needs, or just doing things a little differently. Similarly, it may help to divide household tasks such as washing up, cleaning, and shopping for food. A daily routine may help you feel more in control and less anxious. Going outside each day, if you’re able to, is important for your mental health. So being in nature - seeing trees and birds, or visiting a park, lake or river will help. Think about setting aside time each day when everyone at home can say how they are feeling - for instance, they could share what they have found most difficult and what they are grateful for that day. Sharing feelings without fear of being criticised or told off can help us feel calmer and closer to each other. You and those around you may feel more anxious or irritable than usual, perhaps without realising why. Here's some advice abouttalking to children about scary world eventsand dealing withchange, loss and bereavement. 24th Oct 2025

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/articles/parenting-looking-after-your-own-and-your-childrens-mental-health,Parenting - looking after your own and your children's mental health,"Lots of parents and carers have to balance work and parenting. Some may be looking after their children alone or co-parenting between two households. Whatever the circumstances, parenting can be hard on our mental health and relationships. We can face challenges with our children around routines, social lives, and behaviour. Still, there are opportunities to get to know our children better, learn new things, and be together as a family. Parenting is about doing the best we can with what we have. Here are some ideas and resources for further advice and help. It can sometimes seem like there is only one setting for family – everyone together. However, there are many ways to make the time you spend with everyone in the household as good as can be and with yourself. All parents need time for themselves, and it’s OK to find and have it. If there are other adults in the household, helping each other to have personal time is a huge gift. It sometimes feels impossible to have time to yourself, but with some creative thinking, for example, could a grandparent read a book to your child over video chat so you can get on with something else? Could you give your children some screen time to free up time to relax? Could you keep some time in the evenings after the children have gone to bed – when you don’t do any housework, but do whatever you want? If you have a baby or toddler, try to use their nap times to recharge rather than clean or work. Children also need time on their own. Having more than one child in the house can be great fun when they spend time together – but each child also needs personal space. See if you can help your children identify and make a space of their own. This is hard to do in small flats, but they could build a den on their beds, for example. Phone or video calls and online games with friends and relatives can be a good way to keep in touch – and letter writing for children and adults could be a nice way to surprise someone you’re missing. Finding a balance between different types of activity is a good idea. Reading together, playing games, making a meal together, keeping active or doing something creative are all opportunities to have family time. Trying to eat at least one meal together with time to think and talk about the day can also give everyone a chance to connect. Screen time might cause arguments or tension if you’re unhappy about it. It’s impossible for anyone to be a perfect parent. It's ok to relax the rules on screen time sometimes so you can have more time to work, rest or exercise. There are lots of free, quality content on television and online, from virtual museum tours and theatre, shows to new content on streaming platforms and new games. Search on YouTube or visit the websites of your favourite museums or theatres, for example, to see what they’re offering. It’s always good to know what your kids are watching and doing online and to keep talking about it. Read our guide ontalking to children about healthy internet use. Whether it’s during school time, the weekend or holidays, it can be helpful to plan the day and the week. If we’re at home all the time, it’s easy to lose track of time or end up doing the same old things and feeling bored. Think about having a time to start the day together – even if it's just having breakfast together. Nobody is saying you need a colour-coded timetable for every hour and minute – though if you like that kind of thing, it certainly passes the time. Keeping mealtimes and bedtime routines in place gives a sense of consistency. A weekly meal planner can help plan your shopping and give you all something to look forward to. It’s even better if everyone gets a chance to have their favourite meal and the kids help prepare food. Children show stress differently, so they may take longer to fall asleep or find it hard to settle into activities they usually enjoy. Sleep is important for teenagers, and allowing them to sleep in a little, if possible, may help them cope with their challenges. Allocating chores and rewarding them for doing them can help with children’s boredom, give them a sense of achievement, and take some of the burdens from us. Even very young children can help if you turn it into a game – teaching them about helping and responsibility. There will be times when your children have to study at home, for example, if their school closes. Schooling at home is hard. You may not be a teacher, but you’re a parent doing your best to keep your children’s brains active. Although schools set work, you might also want to get your children going with projects related to their interests. If you work at home, you’ll know that the rhythm of each day is different, what you can achieve varies, and that sometimes you have to give yourself the time to do something else. Let your children know this and reassure them that we all find it hard to stay motivated sometimes. Try and define a couple of schoolwork sessions in the day for primary-age children. For secondary-age children, you can encourage them to study for longer – perhaps sharing some tips if you’re working from home too. Look for useful resources such as videos and quizzes onBBC Bitesize. Go easy, and encourage them to share worries and disappointments they have about school, exams and next steps. Find ways for your children to stay in touch with their friends. Video calls can be fun, but supervise young kids closely, ideally, be in the room or nearby. For older children and teens, check in with them on how they keep in touch with friends. If your children are anxious about meeting up with friends or classmates after being apart, let them know they can take their time. They don’t have to rush back into playing – reassure them that they will soon feel comfortable, but it’s ok if they want to stay close to you for a bit before joining in again. It’s important we recognise and do something about any stress we’re feeling – about parenting, work, family and other challenges. It can seem impossible to make time for yourself or have some time for self-care, but this is when you need it most – even if it’s just for a few minutes. It’s easy to judge yourself as a parent based on what other people are doing, what they’re posting on social media, or what we don’t have or can’t offer. It’s important to give yourself some time. You’re giving your best to your kids – and hopefully, there’s enough left for you. If there isn’t, you need to find a way to recharge yourself. In our tips aboutlooking after your mental health, we suggest various ways of looking after yourself. You can also make a plan for looking after your mental health atNHS Every Mind Matters. Celebrating the small things and remembering what’s going well can help boost your self-esteem and mental well-being. Take care to praise your children when they do well. Be specific. Tell them what they did that you were pleased or proud of and why. This lets them know you’re noticing and interested in their actions. Praise the effort and work they put into things more than the outcome. It helps them feel confident about taking on other challenges. Set realistic expectations. It’s unlikely a younger child can stay quiet for a whole day if you're working from home, but they might be able to let you take a call or answer an email without interruption. Being specific can help – ‘I need 20 minutes for this call, then we can play’ is easier to understand than ‘I need to work’. Give children short tasks they can get stuck into independently while you’re busy doing other things. At the end of the day, talk about the things you’ve been grateful for. You could do this at the dinner table, during bath time or as part of the bedtime routine. You could write these down too. It can quickly become a habit that can remind you of the good things that went well, even on those difficult days. If you can sit with your partner or talk to a friend or relative about what’s going well at the moment, you will probably find that you’re doing better than you think. Volunteering is great for your mental health. Teenagers might be able to volunteer, and there may be community volunteering projects you can do with your younger children. The BBC has ideas onhow to volunteer as a familyor look at ourrandom acts of kindnessfor more ideas. Drawing pictures or writing notes for your neighbours can be a simple way for young children to help people smile. Children often misbehave when stressed, and we may find it hard to respond calmly and rationally. There are bound to be occasions when you lose your temper and shout. It’s important that you say sorry. If you model apologising to your children when you’ve lost your temper, they can do the same to you. For older children, you can accept apologies with a thank you and remind them that they hurt your feelings, but you can move on. It’s important to talk with your children about things going on in the world that might be worrying them. We’ve producedadvice about talking to your children about scary world news. Be as honest as you can at an age-appropriate level and answer questions when they happen. If your circumstances have changed – for example, if you’ve lost your job or have fewer hours – it’s important to be open about that with older children. This allows them to understand the situation without guessing and share their feelings. If you are struggling with parenting, you're not alone.Every Mind Mattershas advice on looking after your child’s mental health. It’s not a sign of weakness to ask for help. You could speak to a friend, relative or another parent with a child the same age as yours. You might have an online parents’ group or forum likeMumsnetto call on. Being a single parent can be particularly challenging - organisations likeGingerbreadhave advice for lone parents. You might also be able to use a local mutual aid or volunteer group. They can help with shopping, for example. Anyone can ask for help, whether or not they can offer help to others, now or in the future.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/bens-story-losing-my-mother-suicide-and-taking-new-challenges-raise-awareness,Losing my mother to suicide,"This content mentions suicide or suicidal thoughts. Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. Ben talks about the loss of his mother to suicide and his choice to support us and help raise awareness and money with his latest challenge. Following the tragic loss of my mother, Gill Hayes, to suicide at the start of 2021, I knew that, in time, I would want to raise both awareness and money for mental health problems to help prevent other families from having to go through what my family continues to go through. This challenge is undoubtedly my biggest to date. Joined by my two good friends Jamie Khan and Charlie Fanous (together now known as “the Pennsylvania Plodders”), we aim to follow the Thames Path from Pangbourne, my childhood home, to The Old Ship, a pub in Hammersmith that my mum used to regularly go to. We aim to complete the 120km route in one go, having set ourselves a time limit of 40 hours. Together with my family, we chose the Mental Health Foundation due to their overall focus on the prevention of mental ill-health and the fantastic work they do in research and applying research to help make a real difference in the lives of so many people. We wanted to take on an exciting challenge that would test us both mentally and physically. As we anticipate finding ourselves questioning both our mental strength and physical capabilities along our walk, we thought it might draw an appropriate comparison to people out there struggling with mental health issues and that by us simply putting one foot in front of another, it may provide a bit of hope and inspiration to those that need it most. Thankfully, the challenge was a huge success - we surpassed our target of walking 120km in 40 hours as we managed 132km (due to some slight planning errors…) in 36 and a half hours! We were luckily blessed with some fantastic weather across both days which meant not having to carry waterproofs or worry about soaking wet feet. Our feet however as expected did take quite a battering, with multiple blisters, aches and pains. We were in high spirits for the majority of the walk. The first 40km flew by as we were filled with enthusiasm and joined by friends along the route. The next stint was a different story. Once the novelty had worn off and we realised how far we still had to go, morale quickly dipped as we began to stop more frequently and started applying deep heat. After a stop for dinner, morale rose once again as we found a second wind and plodded on into the darkness. This lasted until around 2.30 am when the tiredness hit once more and very few words were spoken between us until sunrise. Credit for helping us through this section has to go to my dad, Rob Hayes, as well as some entertaining phone calls, both of which provided fantastic moral support, even if we weren’t very good company, with the lack of sleep really taking its toll. As the sun began to rise, we approached our breakfast stop. It was a fantastic feeling to see sunlight again and see Jamie’s grandparents, Denise and Terry, in the support vehicle that was a key reason for our success. After an extended stop to change clothes and retape our feet, we set off for the last 40km. By now our heavy legs and sleep-deprived heads were really struggling with the task ahead. Gladly, we were shortly joined by some familiar faces who helped us through the final stages. By the last 10km, we had approximately 30 to 40 friends walking in support to see us through to the end and welcome us at the Old Ship. By this point, we had been awake for over 37 hours however the high levels of adrenaline allowed us to socialise at the pub for a little while before our heads began to droop and we were then straight off to bed! We will look back overall with incredibly fond memories. We’d like to thank every single person who helped us along the journey in any way, whether that be a donation, walking with us, or helping us plan and prepare for the challenge. Without the incredible support we received, it would have been a very different experience! We truly hope that our campaign will make a difference in people’s lives, be it through the money raised or simply just a conversation that may not otherwise have happened. If our efforts can help just one person, then we feel it will be completely worth it.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/anisahs-story-my-different-birth-experiences,Anisah's story: my different birth experiences,"This content mentions anxiety, which some people may find triggering. Since having different birth experiences, I can attest that I have experienced my fair share of the maternity system with both positive and negative experiences. I have witnessed how easy it is for women like myself to fall through the cracks if there are insufficient resources or knowledge to support them. Black women are four times more likely to die during childbirth, and mixed-race women are three times more likely. Having experienced birth trauma during the pandemic, I almost became one of those statistics. The feelings ofanxiety, helplessness, and fear that I endured were factors that could have led to worse outcomes. I have been at the receiving end of forceful doctors and consultants, insisting I proceed with particular procedures or disregarding my experience and making judgements about my birth choices. I believed that I was well equipped to navigate these situations, yet I still felt affected by them. I felt that there weren’t many options available to discuss my experiences and so I created my own mum’s community interest group and joined with others. I believe the key factor in providing equal outcomes for Black women is having the ability to advocate for yourself or having someone who you trust to do so on your behalf. It is paramount that women have the resources and knowledge to make informed decisions about the care they wish to receive. It is the bare minimum to expect fair, respectful treatment and to be listened to during our care. My advice to other mothers out there is to get support. Build your village (whether that be through friends, community groups and mental health services), and know what signs of poor mental health to look out for.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/jessicas-story-my-experiences-pregnant-black-woman-uk,My experiences as a pregnant Black woman,"This content mentions anxiety, which some people may find triggering. As a mother of two, I have had two distinct experiences as a pregnant Black woman going through maternal care within the UK. I am disappointed to say that both my experiences were negative. For my own experience, it would have been key to have had perinatal mental health support or care without having to explicitly request help. When you are visiting your child in the neonatal unit, many times we feel alone and tearful. Doctors and nurses witness this, yet there is not a current system where mothers can be heard or advocate for themselves during other complex needs such as concerns about the health of their child. It would be beneficial to have processes in place across maternity services to support all women when they are in vulnerable situations, to prevent poor outcomes in perinatal mental health. A key factor in my experience was how often I was not informed or presented with a choice in my care. My first child was premature, and I experiencedanxietyand low mood. At no point during my journey into the neonatal world was I signposted for perinatal mental health care. However, I have taken my experience in stride and chosen to advocate for myself and my friends and family. If you feel affected by the content you have read, please see ourget helppage for support.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/georgias-story-living-alone-first-time,Georgia's story: living alone for the first time,"This content mentions loneliness and anxiety, which some people may find triggering. Georgia completed a six-month placement with us, supporting the Programmes team with theFeeling Our Wayproject. The Feeling Our Way project supports care-experienced young people through psychoeducation supplied digitally over the course of a year. Every few weeks, young people receive digital information packs that explore themes around mental health, coping strategies, ways to well-being and building confidence. This is part of a growing area of work for the Foundation to address the needs of children and young people who have experienced being in care. Georgia shares her story about what it feels like to move from being in care to living independently from the perspective of lived experience. It’s a bit of a weird feeling, really. Most people get to choose to live alone and decide when that happens for themselves. I didn’t really get much of a say. It was more, “you have to be out before your 18th birthday.” To go from a very chaotic and loud household to almost pure silence is jarring, the two things are almost juxtaposed. You often have a lot of pressure put on you to know what to do. There is often a lot of disconnect between what people think it will be like and what it is like, because being left home alone for a few hours or a night is not the same thing as living alone full time, but there is a bizarre wish to conflate the two things like they are synonymous. I think the transition of going from a house filled with multiple people to a house with just you can be a bit of a confusing one. On top of this, if your peers find out that you live alone, it can be a bit of a burden to worry about if they will try and abuse that. From worrying if your friends will pressure you into parties, abuse your flat, or try and guilt you into letting them stay over when you either can’t have them or just don’t want them for whatever reason. However, the idea ofbeing lonelycan scare a lot of people. If people aren’t ready for independence, they won’t cope well with the practice of it for a good while, no matter how well they play it off as them being fine. If someone hasn’t been taught how to look after themselves, it’s going to be a bit of a shock to the system that stuff must be done and how often you must do it. It can beanxiety-inducingto think about all the things you have to worry about. It can give someone a sense of purpose. It gives a person more experience as to what to do in the future. It can give you a freeing feeling and a sense of authority and autonomy over your own life. It also gives a realistic sense of how the world works when it comes to money,financesand the consequences of actions about your money and flat. I think it can be difficult to find people who are struggling because they don’t want to do what they perceive to be letting people down. Services being there is one thing, but if you’re not making yourself known in the community and the people you’ll affect, then there’s not much of a point in you being there. People can’t use your service if they’re unaware of your services. Not imposing stuff on young people who don’t want it imposed on them is a big one because it won’t work, but giving them the resources to access the services that they want when they’re ready is an important part of the process. The best help in the world won’t help the people that need it but don’t want it. A lot of agencies tend to assume that the lives of young people who live alone are fully consumed by the fact that they live alone, and there is nothing outside of that. Some of us have very busy lives and are not trying to be difficult when we say we do not have the time in the next two to three weeks to see you or do anything, we genuinely don’t. Education can take up a lot of a young person’s time, as can work and extracurricular stuff if we do that. Just because we need support in a certain area doesn’t mean that we don’t have stuff to do outside of that. Not everyone is up to the same number of things as others, and that’s okay, but not everyone works at the pace you want them to either. Different organisations can work in different ways, and not every method of working is going to work for every young person, but that doesn’t make the young person uncooperative. It’s just not the method they need to support them best. If you feel affected by the content you have read, please see ourget helppage for support.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/lucys-story-how-i-feel-about-my-body-teenager,Lucy's story: how I feel about my body as a teenager,"This content mentions body image or generally discusses weight, which some people may find triggering. I don’t find it easy to put down on paper what I feel in my head about theimage I have of my body, it doesn't seem to make sense, and it doesn't feel good enough. I don’t always feel comfortable in my body, but that does not mean I can't show off what I like about myself. I like my eyebrows, eyelashes and my naturally ‘tanned’ skin. My name is Lucy, and body image plays a very big part in a teenager’s life, like mine. Thinking about it, my friends and I don’t tend to talk about our own bodies, but we do comment on what celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Little Mix are wearing. Most of us have likes and dislikes about different parts of our body, we don’t all think and feel alike - personally, if I do not like something, I want to change it, but I know that in reality, what I really need to do is learn to love all of me. To help myself feel better, I wear clothes that make me feel comfortable about myself. If I could, I would wear pyjamas all day because they are comfortable and don’t feel tight; in fact, pyjamas suit everyone, whatever their shape or size! There is a dress that made me feel confident, not a special dress but an everyday one. It wasn’t fancy, but it made me feel special, but it is not easy to put into words why this dress made me feel this way. It went in and out in all the right places, it flowed down to my knees, not too short and not too long, not too loose and not too tight. When you find that perfect outfit, you wish you had bought two of them. In fact, when I think about the clothes I wear, it is often the same outfit day after day, a different t-shirt but always black leggings and my Mickey Mouse jumper. Onsocial media, in particular, there are lots of female stereotypes telling us what we ‘should’ be looking like – slender, tanned, big breasts, curvy bum, painted nails – the impact of this is that most teenage girls that I see posting on social media have fake tan to look golden, fake nails to look more ‘girly’ and pose so that they look like they have bigger breasts and a curvier bum than they do in reality. In my opinion, this is because of the images we see on social media, like Instagram and Snapchat. I think parents should be more careful of what they say around young people because it could have an impact on them for the rest of their life. Yes, parents should encourage a healthy lifestyle for their children, but we also need the flexibility to make our own decisions. Yes, parents should encourage their children to talk to them, but we may not always want to when asked, be available whenever you can. If I could say something to each and every teenager, whatever their gender and wherever they live, it would be this:appreciate what your body can do, not what it can’t do. And in the words of Little Mix, ‘take off all my makeup cause I love what is under it’. If you feel affected by the content you have read, please see ourget helppage for support.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/michaels-story-when-my-body-changed-i-didnt-know-how-feel,"Michael's story: when my body changed, I didn't know how to feel","This content mentions body image or generally discusses weight, which some people may find triggering. My relationship with my body historically has been good, but I would say it’s because I equated being skinny to being healthy, so when things started to change, it made me feel uncertain about how I should feel. Growing up in my teens and well into my 20s, I was a skinny guy – to the point where it was commented on by others, and it became a part of my identity without me actively doing anything to make it that way. Over time, due to a changing life which leaves not a lot of time to do much for myself, I noticed that I was not as slim as I once was, grey hair started, and I began to hear people say, “you are looking tired” to me. I think there is a massive amount of pressure nowadays to conform to a certain look or body type. At my stage in life, I have noticed the rise of the “dad bod” which is, as far as I can see, a statement from guys saying they are proud of carrying more weight and not watching what they eat and so on. It seems a response to a lot of what we see in the media – kind of like being cuddly over having those “rock-hard abs” that Facebook tells you about. I still don’t know how I feel about it though – on the one hand, it is good for people to feel comfortable in the skin they are in regardless of whether they would want to change how they look, but I am not sure if a lot of those men that take this on board would be saying the same to their wives and partners. There is a massive pressure for women to look a certain way; I think there is a fair bit of male entitlement in there that says “we can look how we want”, but there is no similar standard for women. My body image can have a negative impact on my mood and how I feel. I can be fine for ages then catch sight of myself in a mirror and feel like I am looking older or I don’t feel as smart as I used to because I don’t fit into a lot of the clothes I used to wear. I think it knocks my confidence more than a bit because you get into a rut of seeing yourself in a certain negative way and feeling it is easier to do nothing about it than either committing to be happy with yourself or doing something to change what you are not happy with. I think to try and reduce this pressure on ourselves and others, it really needs to start with individuals – for my children (one girl and one boy) I want to get them to be happy with themselves both emotionally and physically and to give them the confidence that happiness isn’t about how you look but about what you have in your life. More broadly, I think men really need to be more open about how they feel about their bodies – the whole discussion about body image has, until recently, been unfairly targeted at women and although I think that is now changing (certainly for younger men) I think we cannot forget that there are whole generations that would find talking about how they feel about their bodies completely alien and this is where support is needed. Like anything, the more we avoid an issue, the worse it becomes. There is no one measure of what “feeling good about your body” is, but we need to do better from school onwards to help us understand how important happiness is and for a lot of people to see that body image is linked to that. I would never have thought growing up that it was something that would bother me, but it does, and I think that the way to address it is to normalise people, including men, having conversations about their bodies and not being dismissed as “weak” for doing so. However, when getting men to talk about how they feel about their bodies, I think there has to be a much greater understanding of how they apply standards to women as it is very well saying you are happy talking about yourself and the things you are not happy with then criticising how your wife or partner looks – there is a double standard that needs to be addressed.

I look in the mirror, and my belly looks like a popped balloon. I hate it. I am so embarrassed by it that bikinis are nowhere to be found in my wardrobe. But I have learned to live with it. A kind of ‘war wound’ of my body changing shape to carry and produce children – or perhaps even a ‘trophy’ for winning that battle? It is 20 years since my last baby, so I am now middle-aged with three giant adult sons (all well over 6ft and weighing more than 13 stone each!). My body is on a sloping downward turn in every way. My once firm, athletic and toned flesh is now wobblier, less firm and frankly, often disappointing compared to what it used to be able to do. It amazes me still that my three giants, one of which is 6’4’’, fitted inside me during pregnancy. His once tiny hand, which wrapped around my thumb, is now large enough to take both of my hands. I marvel at this fact, and sometimes, me and this particularly big son stare at each other in wonder at how this happened. These little (ish) babies, who were once completely dependent on me, are now fully grown, bigger than their 10lb start in life and independent of me. One of them is expecting the next generation with his wife. My daughter-in-law’s body is now going through the same journey as mine did 20 years ago, but now with my own son watching in awe (and slight panic) as her slim body swells joyfully, following that age-old path. This sacrificial maternal journey is one of the extremes; on the one hand, my body and time will never be the same again, but on the other hand, the gain of pride and amazement at being able to produce three giants for this world (in all senses of the word) is impossible to put into words.My body truly is a ‘trophy’.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/heathers-story-walking-nature-my-therapy,Heather's story: walking in nature is my therapy,"This content mentions depression, death or bereavement, anxiety and loneliness, which some people may find triggering. Heather, aged 62 (and a half), is a mum of 4, grandmother of 5 and a child at heart. She shares how walking in nature helps her mental health. I have experiencedanxietyanddepressionover the last decade since my 18-year-old daughter died in late 2008. I was prescribedanti-depressantsas a means to cope with this. Whilst they took the edge off my depression, they didn’t really make me feel like ‘I got this’ or lift my low mood. I threw myself into work and family and never really looked at alternatives to the pills. I did trytalking therapies, but whilst this helped me get things off my chest, it didn’t help in the longer term. I knew I’d never get over the death of my daughter, but I didn’t want to feel the emptiness that was overwhelming or wallow for the rest of my life. I used food as a coping mechanism, and as a result, the weight piled on. My physical health was now as compromised as my mental health. It was a vicious circle – the more depressed I became, the more I ate. The more I ate, the heavier I got, and the depressive cycle ensued. In late 2018, I decided on a new project – ME! I cut down on the rubbish I put into my body and decided to use walking as a form of exercise. At first, I just ‘pavement pounded’ and I used lamp posts as a guide and a challenge. From doing six lamp posts one day to ten a few days later and so on until I could walk for an hour. Once I was confident doing that, I joined in on a couple of free Ranger-led walks in my local country parks. These are mostly free, and most local councils have them. This introduced me to the countryside, and I loved it. I then found a women’s walking group that was basically a Facebook page where women from all over Scotland organised walks in their local areas, and you could sign up for them – all free. On this journey, I managed to lose 4.5 stone and my mental health and well-being became the best it had been in a very long time. Nature became my saviour, and I loved the calmness that I felt when I was out walking in the open air amongst the trees and green spaces. My mood instantly improved and a sense of well-being became evident. I loved this newfound freedom and escapism that walking gifted me. I even managed to come off my anti-depressants as my depression lifted. Fast forward to March 2020, the pandemic hit, and lockdown ensued. My group walks stopped, and travel was banned except for essential travel. That and working from home had an impact on both my weight and my mental health. The weight crept up, and my mood began to get worse. I could feel the anxiety and depression taking hold of me again. Life in lockdown had curtailed my newfound love of walking with a women’s walking group that I had joined the year before. I had just found the confidence to walk with complete strangers and had been introduced to new places that I had never been to before. The thing that worried me most was going back to feeling depressed and relying on meds to get me through the day. I knew I had a foolproof formula that supported my well-being, I knew I loved being out in nature. I also knew I couldn’t travel down to Loch Lomond and further beyond, but I also knew that there were country parks and greenfield sites in my area, so I had a look at the walk highlands routes that include local walks, and amazingly I found dams and lochs, forests and even local parks had an abundance ofgreen space locally in Renfrewshire. I explored these places on my doorstep, and the wonder of nature didn’t disappoint. I could get to most places fairly easily and all within restrictions. The fresh air, the beauty of nature and the instant sense of calm and serenity I found walking in the green open spaces was all the therapy I needed. My mood lifted, the despair and crowded thoughts in my mind evaporated, and I felt a sense of peace enveloping my whole body. Writing this in 2021 and reflecting on the past couple of years, I recognise that walking and connecting with nature has enabled me to discover beautiful peaceful places where I to listen to the birdsong without the disruptive noise of traffic outside my house on a busy main road. I can check out the flowers. I listen to the babbling streams and feel the breeze on my face and watch the sun filtering and dancing through the trees. I discovered lochs and glens, forests and beaches and even climbed my first Munro –Ben Lomondat the age of 61! The scenery in Scotland is second to none, and even the weather plays a part in the beauty of nature, with moody skies, changeable cloud formations and four seasons in one day at times. I got to see parts of Scotland that I had never been to. I splashed in mud and got soaked to the skin on many occasions; in those moments, I was transported back to childhood when I hadn’t a care in the world. I’ve met lots of lovely women, and many who also found that walking in nature had given them a sense of purpose, reduced theirloneliness and isolationand improved their mental health and well-being, and for those few hours, they could just be themselves. Word must have got around as there are over 22,000 women in that walking group now! Walking and connecting with nature for me meant that I managed to get off medication, as my anxiety and depression lifted. I know that when I feel my well-being becoming compromised, I have a healthy coping strategy to hand. However, I also know that if I needed to go back on medication, I would as there is nothing to be ashamed of. For now, walking in nature is my therapy, and it works. It lowers my blood pressure, lessens my stress, makes me feel good, and I can be at peace with myself. If I lose the weight again, then that’ll be an added bonus; but for now, anything that makes me smile and look forward to the day ahead is good enough for me. I’d encourage anyone who struggles with their mental health to give it a go – you have nothing to lose and plenty to gain. You don’t need to be super fit; a stroll or even a sit down in the park and take in the views. If you feel affected by the content you have read, please see ourget helppage for support.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/kas-story-turning-nature-during-pandemic,Kas' story: turning to nature during the pandemic,"Kas, 23, is a student in London. Here, she shares her experience of connecting withnatureduring the pandemic. The pandemic has been challenging and relentless. The hits seem to keep on coming and the light at the end of the tunnel has become blurred and faint. It can make it hard to be optimistic about the future. One aspect of pre-quarantine life I certainly don’t miss is the constant Brexit talk, everywhere you went. Although, that’s not to say COVID-19 is unrelenting. Others may say they enjoy the break from the Northern line’s rush hour, while some introverts secretly rejoice at the end to all parties and large crowds. For me, I’ve found turning to nature has made it easier to stay positive whilst being away from friends and family and having absolutely nothing to do. Being confined to four walls and staring at screens for hours on end, it’s become an escape and comfort, a lifeline even, to take a walk outside. I’ve found myself looking forward to simply walking through the park, lying down on the grass and enjoying the view. There’s so much colour and beauty to be found in the sky, trees and flowers. Being present with the ground beneath me, with the grass between my fingers and the cloudless blue sky above helps me to recharge after being in bleak, artificial environments for extended periods of time. As a Londoner, a lot of my daily life involves commuting past grey buildings, on a grey road, under grey clouds. It’s all very static and mundane to look at. Over the pandemic, nature has opened my eyes to how beautiful naturally occurring phenomena can be. Red and pink sunsets illuminating the sky whilst I walk back home is something I will never get tired of. No two sunsets are ever the same, and I find it almost offensive to walk past a sunset and not appreciate it. Yet, I know however much I try to capture its magnificence on camera, a photograph will never do it justice. The spectrum of colour nature brings to our lives is a blessing that I don’t take for granted. And the best part of it all? It doesn’t cost a thing. Having made great medical advances to be able to produce artificial substitutes of almost anything now, it can be easy to opt for such alternatives to suit our busy lifestyles. For example, getting your much needed Vitamin D from a pill does the job, but the benefits of actually feeling the warmth of the sun on your skin far outweigh doing so. Technology has kept us in contact with our loved ones and has given us access to endless entertainment to maintain our sanity. But the irony of being connected to the rest of the world online means we're disconnected more than ever from our environment. To be able to see, touch or smell real creatures and plants is an incomparable experience that a video or picture on a screen will never replace, no matter how high definition it becomes. The pandemic has shone a light on the resilience of nature, with plant life flourishing again and animals reclaiming city spaces while we were in lockdown. It was refreshing to read aboutmountain goats roaming around the streets of Waleswhilst the news constantly reported the rise in cases and deaths. Just as the earth has adapted, we too have shown great perseverance in the face of COVID-19, highlighting our connection to this earth. There is so much to learn from nature and over quarantine, I have gained a deep respect for the natural world. It serves as a reminder that despite the devastation, life will persist. Breathing in clean, fresh air is becoming harder to do as air pollution becomes a serious problem in our cities. This makes protecting and appreciating green spaces among our urban jungles all the more important. My new found appreciation for nature will continue long after the pandemic has ended and will shape how I navigate the world now. One way I aim to do this is by recycling more and including plant-based alternatives in my diet. As a 20-something, my inability to drive used to be embarrassing but now I embrace the decision to not own a car as playing my part to reduce global warming. I love to cycle instead, as I much prefer the rush of feeling the wind in my face than sitting in traffic. Nature has given us so much in abundance. It's been here before we were and will be here long after we've gone. This does not mean we should take it for granted or take sole ownership of what we have access to - this planet doesn't only belong to us, we share it alongside other incredible species of plants and creatures.So it’s on our generation to take responsibility for our actions and those before us to leave this planet a better place than we found it.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/articles/three-ways-look-after-your-mental-health-during-cost-living-crisis,Three ways to look after your mental health during the cost-of-living crisis,"The cost-of-living crisis affects almost everyone and all parts of the UK. The cost of heating our homes, keeping the lights on and running the washing machine has increased a lot. And the cost of food means that every meal has to be budgeted for and planned in a way we have not seen for decades. And of course, the rest of our lives have not stopped. These latest financial worries are on top of our usual stresses around work, family, friends, and our health... Worrying about these things every day means it can be hard to find the time to look after yourself - it may feel like you do not have the headspace to take on any more. But even when there's so much going on, it’s important to find time to protect your well-being and mental health. Positive, healthy relationships are always important. In times of trouble these relationships can be even more important. Bottling up worries and letting them go round and round in your head can be damaging. Talking about things with someone you trust can help relieve the pressure, and solutions could even come out of it too. You might also find that they have similar feelings and want to talk about them as well. It’s normal to worry about how friends and family might react to hearing about your financial issues – but many people are going through something similar and share the same concerns. If you do not have someone you can easily talk with about your financial worries, you can call a helpline likeSamaritanswho will listen and help you think and talk through your options. It can feel overwhelming when bills keep arriving on your doorstep or in your email inbox, and tempting to ignore them. But try not to do this. Deal with them when they arrive – this way they will not play on your mind or lead to bigger worries like fines and penalties for non-payment. Most banks, companies and organisations will understand if you get in touch and explain that you’re struggling. If they know your situation, they may help you come up with a manageable payment plan or negotiate another way forward. Speak to your localCitizens Advice(England, Scotland and Wales) orAdvice NI(Northern Ireland) if you’re worried about paying bills and any debts you have. They can also advise you on any benefits you may be entitled to that you’re not getting. Yourlocal councilmay also be able to help with emergency loans and grants, and the government’s ‘Help for Households’ has lots of information about what support is available and advice and tips to help you save money. There is also specific information available from the devolved governments inScotland,WalesandNorthern Ireland. You can also search online for some free budgeting tools like apps or templates to help you get control of your incomings or outgoings. It’s important to keep looking after your physical health too. In times of stress things like our diet, sleep and getting enough exercise tend to suffer. But neglecting these areas will have an impact on your mental health, so try to find and stick to good routines: Organisations that can help you during the cost-of-living crisis Find out more about what you can do to protect your mental, emotional and physical health during the cost-of-living crisis and how you can help support others. 24th Oct 2025

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/jolies-story-my-experience-loss-during-covid-19,Jolie's story: my experience of loss during COVID-19,"This content mentions death or bereavement, which some people may find triggering. We have all experienced so many emotions since the UK locked down on 23 March 2020. Fear, uncertainty, and the building of a cumulative sense of loss. ""Who would have believed that through a pandemic, we would lose the freedom to be together, to hug and kiss those we love?"" asked my Mum. At the time of writing, I work as the Programmes Manager of Empowerment & Later Life at the Mental Health Foundation. Since lockdown began, ourStanding Together Cymruproject participants have been speaking on the phone every week. They discussed some of their experiences of loss in the past year: Many have commented on ordinarily being content in their own decision to be on their own in their own company, but to have that decision made for them – and to be forced to be alone and not see anyone for months - is different. There are people who receive up to four phone calls from different family members every day but say, “once I’ve put that phone down, there is nothing.” This feeling of “nothing” behind the closed door of the flat. Also, the importance of having a window to look out of – and to listen to the noise from the streets and the local environments. One woman commented on how silent it now sounded outside since the schools and pubs were closed again. ‘Silence’ and ‘nothingness’ seem to resonate with many participants in the project. Numerous comments on “I have no confidence left” which has developed through a loss of social contact. This will not have been helped by the sense that the lives of older people are less valuable than others as they are nearer the end of their lives. People have spoken about how tangible this felt to them in the early months of lockdown, with people with Covid being discharged back to care homes. In 2021, I was getting different virtual groups to draw what they miss, for people to see and talk about what they have lost. People have drawn the places they miss and family and friends in houses they have not seen for a year. All of us, over the last year, have lost our way of life. We have also all been living with a greater fear of death, our own mortality, and the terror of people we love dying, yet we struggle tospeak about death. Rituals about dying have, over the past century, become more removed, people die in hospitals, hospices and fewer at home. We are uncomfortable with the word death, “losing someone” and “passing away” can feel safer and less final. Over the last year, death has been present like no other. Loved ones have died, people have died caring for others, and people have died before their time. In the UK, we seem poorly equipped to give expression to what we have lost. We were told a lot of people would die, but there has been no guidance about how to mourn collectively. When Captain Sir Tom Moore died this February, we were instructed to clap to celebrate a long, good, and inspiring life to the very end. But where is the acknowledgement of the unimaginable sorrow for those people grieving the loss of 122,500 people (at the time of writing) who have died in the UK? It was striking, listening to Joe Biden speak at the Lincoln Memorial before his presidential inauguration: 'To heal you must remember, it’s hard to remember, that’s how we heal, and it’s important to do that as a nation.' The UK must do the same. If you feel affected by the content you have read, please see ourget helppage for support.

Ruth has had a ‘lifelong affinity with nature’, and she wants other people to feel the benefits. Ruth is supported by Standing Together Cymru, a project which aims to improve mental health and build community connections. Our survey found 72% of Welsh adults said being close to nature improves their mood, whilst half said it helped them cope with stress. “I wouldn’t be here today if it wasn’t for the garden. That sounds a bit dramatic, but it has done an awful lot for my mental health. I can come out here feeling very uptight and that I can’t cope with this. And as soon as I get dirt under my nails because I haven’t put my gloves on, I’m at peace.” - Ruth Standing Together Cymruwas completed in May 2021, but its legacy will live on in the people that have been supported and impacted by the project, which continued throughout the pandemic by adapting from face-to-face to telephone support and making new connections between tenants across the four housing associations in South East Wales.

As clichéd as it may sound, I try to live fully in the present, with a sense of positive expectation and an opportunity for expansion. I feel blessed to have lived the life I have, even with lived experience ofanxiety. As I have grown older, I have understood the need to know what and who makes you happy – and add it to a list, or as I call it my ‘mental health tool kit’. I would also say to my younger self: remember, you are the holder of the key to your own destiny. Decide for yourself what your experience will be; listen to others but let the decision be yours. Also, remember, in life, everything needs balance. Different-sized cogs all play their part in the forward momentum of life – one is no less and no more important. They all require attention; be kind to yourself. Finally, I like to remember Desiderata by Max Hermann, an excerpt of which says: “In the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/james-story-my-experience-anorexia-and-eating-disorders,My experience with anorexia and eating disorders,"This content mentions eating disorders, body image or generally discusses weight, which some people may find triggering. It’s ‘Eating Disorder Awareness Week (EDAW)’ from 27 February 2023, and this year’s focus is oneating disorderawareness inmen. Yes, that’s us strong, tough men who hide our feelings. Oh, hang on a minute, that’s not actually true, is it? It’s a myth that it’s only women and girls who suffer with ‘eating disorders’. The National Association for Males with Eating Disorders estimates that 25% to 40% of people with eating disorders are men and boys. The big blocker to getting help isstigma, together with a lack of understanding about the size and presentation of eating disorders in the male population can mean that eating disorders are not identified or treated early enough. Of course, it is possible that men and boys are particularly resistant to early intervention. One of the main reasons for this could be a reduced likelihood of family, friends or medical professionals suspecting an eating disorder as early as they would in a female with the same symptoms. So, this is my story about how I fell victim to the deadly disease ‘Anorexia Nervosa’. Thankfully and luckily, I live to tell the tale and turn my wounds into wisdom. I hope that this will help people who are affected to understand the importance of getting help, no matter what type of eating disorder they may have. For two years in my early twenties I lived with anorexia but convinced myself that I was fine. Only when my weight dropped, did I finally agree to get the help that I needed. I now raise awareness of the illness to help others. I was a relatively chubby child, and, as I’m sure you know, kids can be mean. I was bullied at school for the way I looked and, at one point, was even given the nickname ‘Bacon Boy.’ But looking back, it didn’t make me desperately unhappy. Not at the time. It wasn’t like those unkind words made me want to change myself or fit in or triggered an eating disorder. Although, I suppose, in some way, that’s what did happen. It just crept up, surprising me years later when I was 22. After leaving school, I was happy. I was living at home in Milton Keynes, I studied horticulture and then ended up working for a local company. Everything felt pretty stable. As I got older, I did want to look good and feel better in my skin, so I signed up to the local gym and found that I actually really enjoyed it. I fell into a good routine; making my own lunch in the morning, going to work and then the gym after that. I lost weight, felt good, and my life as an 18-year-old seemed very normal. Until I got offered a secondment in London which meant being away from home and the familiarity of that entire routine. That’s when things began to change and over those few months away from home, I got used to the feeling of being empty and hungry, and what’s more, I liked it. What also happened, as I began eating all of my meals alone and doing nothing but work and going to the gym, I began to isolate myself from other people. I didn’t feel comfortable being around anyone else, having people watch what I was (or wasn’t) eating, so I cut myself off. My work colleagues didn’t really know me, so they didn’t notice much difference, but when I went home after my secondment ended, my family saw that my behaviour had changed. I kept telling them I was fine. I thought I was. I just wanted to be left alone, and the more they told me to eat, the less I wanted to. But I guess that deep, deep down, I knew things weren’t fine. I remember at the same time thinking that I just wanted to fade away, to not exist, to be gone by the time my sister had her baby, six months later. However, I pushed those thoughts and feelings down and carried on. There were moments during those months, before my diagnosis, where I was feeling a lot of tension. When you’re malnourished, it plays havoc with your emotions. I was angry, snappy and volatile. My parents didn’t understand what was happening to me or how to help, how could they when I didn’t know what was happening myself? When I finallyspoke to a GP, they told me that I was severely underweight. You might think that at this point, things would start to look up. But for me, this is where my mental health actually hit rock bottom. The first thing that happened was that I was signed off work for eight weeks and had to declare my licence to the DVLA as I was considered a risk on the roads. It felt like I was being punished. In fact, worse, it felt like people had taken away my control and were trying to control me. I was told that I was entitled to 30 weeks ofCognitive Behavioural Therapy. Something that I really didn’t want. It’s hard to explain, but with anorexia you can only start to accept help and get better when you hold your hands up and say, “I need help”. But I still couldn’t do that. I was in complete denial. My aim then was just to be healthy and for it all to be over - to be left alone. So, I went from being extremely anorexic tobinge eating. I now show myself compassion, and I can give myself a ‘talking to’ when I have thoughts that might not be healthy. Of course, I’ve had setbacks, but over the last eight years I’ve really managed to get myself back on track. I’m still very aware of what I eat. There’s no doubt about that, but I don’t restrict myself anymore. And on the days that I do indulge, it doesn’t hurt as much as it used to. They helped me see things differently, admit that I ‘did’ need help and recognise that I never want to be back in that painful place again. People started saying that I looked good and how much ‘healthier’ I must be now that I was gaining weight. What they couldn’t see was the way I was crumbling inside. Even though it’s hard to explain or pinpoint when, why or how the therapy started to help. It just did. I think when you start to feed yourself physically with food, and mentally with therapy, you get a better perspective and understanding. I learned to recognise the voice in my head - the one telling me that my weight needed to be as low as possible for me to be happy - and change it. When the therapy ended, the hard work on myself really began, but the treatment had given me the tools to do that, and what’s more, I wanted to. It’s why I’m now extremely passionate about raising awareness of male eating disorders and talking about how to recognise it in friends and colleagues - and in yourself. Luckily,Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)helped me, and I’ve turned things around. But I’m very aware that so many people are convincing their friends, family - and themselves - that they’re fine. I hope that by talking about my experience, it will help them. Eating disorderscontinue to have the highest mortality rates of ALL mental illnesses. Yes, all mental illnesses - shocking, I know. There has been much improved training for healthcare professionals over the past year. But we need to see more accurate awareness of the early signs, symptoms and risks of eating disorders, and we need to see more prioritisation of early detection and treatment, especially in men and boys and before medical treatment become necessary. As someone with lived experience, I strongly believe any related deaths arepreventableif people get the right care early enough.Recoveryfrom eating disorders is possible, but getting the right treatment early is key for the sufferer and the increasing strain on our health care system. Eating disorders are a severe mental illness and shouldn’t be underestimated. And if you could take anything away from my story, it would be the following: “All the advice in the world won’t help, until you are willing to help yourself”. You can and will get better!

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/shereens-story-my-experience-long-covid,Shereen's story: my experience of long COVID,"This content mentions anxiety, which some people may find triggering. According to ONS data, in December 2021 over 1.3 million people in the UK were experiencing the effects of long COVID – that's one in 50 of us. Symptoms vary and include shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, chronic fatigue, muscle pain, loss of appetite, changes to sense of taste and smell, confusion,depressionandanxiety. Managing the physical symptoms of long COVID is difficult enough, but the mental health impact is just as severe, made even more challenging due to the limited awareness and understanding of the condition. Shereen, 38, from Glasgow, was first hit by a severe bout ofcoronavirusin March 2020 which required hospital attention. ""When I got to the hospital to be checked, I was put in a waiting room with lots of other people with suspected COVID. I remember thinking to myself that if I didn’t have it, I would have by the time I left. When I saw the doctor, she wasn’t wearing any PPE, and I was so worried for her and scared that I would be the one to infect her. That was a thought that played on my mind for weeks after.” Diagnosed in the time before routine testing, Shereen was sent home to her flat in the city centre where she lives alone. “I was so ill, I felt like I was going to die. The symptoms of COVID are agony. I’m normally a very self-sufficient and capable person, but it felt like I had visited a war zone. Aside from the physical pain, I felt toxic. I was very conscious of the risk of infecting others and made sure to isolate, even covering the letterbox with a plastic bag. After my initial illness, I hoped I would be on the mend, but I’ve suffered from relapses ever since. The first was around three weeks later. It felt like a scab being ripped off my lungs; it felt like they were on fire. Even so, it took me six months to go back to the same hospital I attended when I first had COVID to attend a respiratory clinic.I was so anxiousabout being there again, it gave me panic attacks.” While Shereen is still feeling the impact of long COVID, the relapses are less frequent than before. However, her life now is much quieter than before as she suffers from exhaustion and fatigue. She can’t walk for more than 20 minutes or talk for long periods without scheduling enough rest to avoid being completely wiped out. She is still living with muscle and joint pain, for which she has to take two nerve pain medications and see a physiotherapist. Prior to falling ill with COVID, Shereen was a singer who was also ready to embark upon a new cupcake-selling business. Both of those have had to be put on hold indefinitely, and she is currently unemployed. “While living with this relentless condition, I just don’t feel myself. It’s like everything affects my sense of self and I always feel different. That is really tough to deal with because I don’t know if I will ever feel normal again. It really hits you emotionally as you just want to get better, and I always worry about another relapse as I often think to myself ‘I can’t do this again’. “I sought counselling because I knew something was wrong. I had a really horrible feeling constantly, as though I was reliving the agony of when I was sick. The counselling is helping. I’m not usually very open about my emotions, even to myself, but COVID exploded something within me so my normal coping mechanisms weren’t going to work. The counsellor does different exercises with me to identify my feelings and how I relate to them: for example, asking me to describe the feeling as a colour. ""I catch up with my friends in video calls, but I need to make sure I’m well rested and have the energy for it. Other than that, I find chatting to people on theLong COVID Facebook Grouphas been really helpful. It’s great to talk to people who really understand what you’re going through and share ideas. That’s why I also set up a private Facebook group that meets regularly to talk about everything – life, symptoms, dreams for the future. I knew there would be people out there who would be struggling to cope so I wanted everyone to feel like they’re not alone. We’re all there for each other in a way that perhaps our friends and family can’t be. ""Other things I’ve been doing for my own mental health are yin yoga, meditation, keeping a mood diary and creative writing.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/cy/explore-mental-health/stories/shereens-story-my-experience-long-covid,Stori Shereen: Covid Hir,"This content mentions anxiety, which some people may find triggering. Mae’r pandemig wedi bod yn heriol i bawb, er hyn, gall llawer ohonom fod yn optimistaidd ynglŷn â’r dyfodol wrth i gyfyngiadau’r cyfnod clo lacio ac wrth i fwy o bobl gael eu brechu. Fodd bynnag, i bobl y mae Covid hir yn effeithio arnynt, gall y golau ym mhen draw’r twnnel ymddangos yn llawer pellach i ffwrdd. Yn ôl data’r Swyddfa Ystadegau Gwladol (ONS), fis Mawrth 2021 roedd dros un filiwn o bobl yn y DU yn dioddef effeithiau Covid hir. Er bod symptomau’n amrywio, mae llawer yn cyfeirio atynt fel rhai di-baid sy’n cynnwys prinder anadl, peswch parhaus, poen yn y frest, blinder cronig, poen yn y cyhyrau, colli chwant bwyd, colli blas ac arogl, a dryswch. Mae rheoli symptomau corfforol covid hir yn ddigon anodd ond mae’r effaith ar iechyd meddwl yr un mor ddifrifol, sydd hyd yn oed yn fwy heriol oherwydd yr ymwybyddiaeth a’r ddealltwriaeth gyfyngedig o’r cyflwr. Cafodd Shereen, 38, o Glasgow ei tharo gan achos difrifol o coronafeirws fis Mawrth 2020 a bu’n rhaid iddi gael ei thrin yn yr ysbyty. Shereen: ""Roeddwn i mor sâl, roeddwn i’n teimlo fel mod i’n mynd i farw. Pan gyrhaeddais yr ysbyty, cefais fy rhoi mewn ystafell aros gyda llawer o bobl eraill yr amheuwyd eu bod yn dioddef o Covid. Rwy’n cofio meddwl, os nad oedd Covid gen i, fe fyddai cyn i mi adael. Pan welais y meddyg, doedd hi ddim yn gwisgo unrhyw PPE ac roeddwn yn poeni amdani ac yn ofni mai fi fyddai’n ei heintio. Roedd hynny’n chwarae ar fy meddwl am wythnosau wedi hynny.” Cafodd Shereen ddiagnosis cyn i brofion ddod yn fater o drefn, a chafodd ei hanfon adref i’w fflat yng nghanol y ddinas lle mae’n byw ar ben ei hun. Ychwanegodd: “Mae symptomau Covid yn arteithiol.Fel rheol, rydw i’n berson hunangynhaliol a galluog iawn ond roedd yn teimlo fel fy mod wedi bod mewn rhyfel. Ar wahân i’r boen gorfforol, roeddwn yn teimlo’n wenwynig. Roeddwn yn ymwybodol iawn o’r risg o heintio eraill a gwnes yn siŵr fy mod yn ynysu, a gorchuddio’r blwch llythyrau gyda bag plastig hyd yn oed. Ar ôl fy salwch cychwynnol, roeddwn yn gobeithio y byddwn yn gwella, ond rydw i wedi dioddef gydag ailwaelu ers hynny. Digwyddodd yr ailwaelu cyntaf oddeutu tair wythnos yn ddiweddarach. Roedd yn teimlo fel bod crachen yn cael ei rhwygo oddi ar fy ysgyfaint; roedd yn teimlo fel eu bod ar dân. Er hynny, cymerodd chwe mis i mi fynd yn ôl i’r un ysbyty y bûm ynddo pan gefais Covid gyntaf er mwyn mynd i glinig problemau anadlu. Roeddwn i mor bryderus am fod yno eto, cefais byliau o banig.” Er bod Shereen yn dal i deimlo effaith Covid hir, mae’r ailwaelu’n digwydd yn llai aml na chynt. Fodd bynnag, mae ei bywyd nawr yn llawer distawach nag o’r blaen gan ei bod yn dioddef o orludded a blinder. Nid yw’n gallu cerdded am fwy nag ugain munud na siarad am gyfnodau hir heb gynllunio gorffwys addas ymlaen llaw er mwyn osgoi bod yn gwbl ddi-egni. Mae hi’n dal i fyw gyda phoen yn y cyhyrau a’r cymalau, ac mae’n rhaid iddi gymryd dwy feddyginiaeth poen nerfol a gweld ffisiotherapydd. Cyn mynd yn sâl gyda Covid, roedd Shereen yn gantores a oedd hefyd yn barod i gychwyn busnes gwerthu teisennau bach. Bu’n rhaid gohirio’r ddau beth am gyfnod amhenodol ac ar hyn o bryd mae hi’n ddi-waith. Dywedodd Shereen: “Wrth fyw gyda’r cyflwr ‘di-baid’ hwn, dwi ddim yn teimlo fel fi fy hun. Mae fel pe bai popeth yn effeithio ar fy synnwyr o fy hunan ac rydw i bob amser yn teimlo’n wahanol. Mae’n anodd iawn delio â hynny oherwydd dydw i ddim yn gwybod a fydda’ i byth yn teimlo’n normal eto. Mae wir yn eich taro’n emosiynol gan eich bod ond eisiau bod yn well, ac rydw i bob amser yn poeni am ailwaelu eto ac yn meddwl ‘Alla’i ddim gwneud hyn eto’."" “Ym mis Awst dechreuais dderbyn cwnsela gan fy mod yn gwybod bod rhywbeth o’i le. Roedd gennyf deimlad gwirioneddol erchyll drwy’r amser, fel petawn yn ail-fyw’r boen pan oeddwn yn sâl. Mae’r cwnsela’n helpu. Dydw i ddim yn agored iawn am fy emosiynau fel arfer, hyd yn oed gyda fi fy hun, ond fe ffrwydrodd Covid rhywbeth y tu mewn i mi felly doedd fy mecanweithiau ymdopi arferol ddim yn mynd i weithio. Mae’r cwnselydd yn gwneud gwahanol ymarferion efo fi i adnabod fy nheimladau a sut rwy’n uniaethu â nhw. Er enghraifft, technegau datgysylltiol fel gofyn i mi ddisgrifio teimlad fel lliw."" ""Mae’r cwnsela’n helpu. Dydw i ddim yn agored iawn am fy emosiynau fel arfer, hyd yn oed gyda fi fy hun, ond fe ffrwydrodd Covid rhywbeth y tu mewn i mi felly doedd fy mecanweithiau ymdopi arferol ddim yn mynd i weithio."" ""Rydw i mewn swigen gyda ffrind, sy’n nyrs, a’i theulu, ond dydw i ond wedi’u gweld nhw bedair gwaith yn ystod y flwyddyn ddiwethaf. Rydw i hefyd yn dal i fyny gyda fy ffrindiau trwy alwadau fideo, ond mae’n rhaid i mi wneud yn siŵr fy mod wedi gorffwyso a bod gennyf yr egni ar gyfer hynny. Ar wahân i hynny, mae sgwrsio â phobl ar Grŵp Covid Hir Facebook wedi bod yn llawer o help. Mae’n wych siarad â phobl sydd wir yn deall yr hyn rydych yn mynd drwyddo a rhannu syniadau. Dyna pam y gwnes i greu grŵp Facebook preifat sy’n cyfarfod yn rheolaidd i siarad am bopeth – bywyd, symptomau, breuddwydion ar gyfer y dyfodol. Roeddwn yn gwybod y byddai pobl allan yna a oedd yn cael trafferth ymdopi, felly roeddwn i eisiau i bawb deimlo nad oeddent ar eu pennau eu hunain. Rydyn ni i gyd yno ar gyfer ein gilydd mewn ffordd, efallai, na all ein teulu a’n ffrindiau fod."" “Pethau eraill rydw i wedi bod yn eu gwneud ar gyfer fy iechyd meddwl yw yoga yin, myfyrdod, cadw dyddiadur hwyliau, ac ysgrifennu creadigol. Er, nid yw’n ymddangos bod fy mraich chwith yn gweithio ac rwy’n llaw chwith felly rydw i wedi gorfod ysgrifennu gyda fy llaw dde.” Gan edrych i’r dyfodol, mae Shereen yn obeithiol y bydd yn cael y brechiad yn fuan, sydd, mewn rhai achosion o Covid hir, wedi helpu i leddfu symptomau.

This is not simply because it’s the ‘right thing to do’, but because recognising, valuing, improving and protecting mental wellbeing in the workplace makes good business sense. The Mental Health Foundation, Oxford Economics and Unum undertook this research to shift the narrative on workplace mental health from discussion of the financial burden of mental health problems to one of the value of mental health as an asset: of individuals, of companies and of the economy. Our report, produced with employee benefits specialistsUnum, shows that the value added by people with mental health problems in the workforce is greater than the costs arising. Improving and protecting mental health secures that value and should help reduce cost. The research combines three approaches: 26th Jun 2025

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/tyras-story-facing-my-mirror,Tyra's story: facing my mirror,"This content mentions body image, which some people may find triggering. As part of ourMind Over Mirror campaign, Tyra opens up about her relationship with her skin and how this affects her mental health. Teenagers sometimes have spots, and as a young teenager in school, this was something I experienced. It was never really a major concern for me since I recognised it was a part of puberty. So, a couple of spots here and there may have been different to my preteen spotless face, but it still was never drastic enough to worry me. This all changed when I reached my later teenage years. As I continued to grow and my body continued to develop, I started to notice my skin increasingly change. My skin became more textured. I can pinpoint the exact moment I ‘found out’ my skin had pores (seems dramatic but it truly was a revelation). I recall looking in the mirror and seeing what seemed like a few tiny holes on my nose. I’m pretty sure I thought I was developing some sort of illness - no joke. I remember googling ‘I have tiny holes on my face, what are they?’ to find out they were pores. Realising that my skin wasn’t pore-less like the skin I saw in magazines, TV and media wasn’t the last thing my skin surprised me with. What would truly awaken my love-hate relationship with my skin was the day I woke up to look in the mirror and saw that I had acne. Again, I ignorantly didn’t know it was acne then. I just remember feeling completely different about what I was looking at in the mirror. It wasn’t the same as my usual adolescent breakouts of one or two spots. This breakout was almost as if my skin had erupted with multiple boil-like spots that came through all at once. These spots were more colourful: a combination of pink, red and white. They also happened to be more painful, physically and emotionally. For the first time ever, I remember making my way to school being overly worried about my appearance and specifically what was on my face. The unwanted acne I had on my face introduced me to many other firsts: A major first for me was that this was the first time in my life I wanted to change myself. I desperately wanted to change the skin I was in. I would repeatedly ask my mum to take me to the doctor so I could be ‘treated’. Although she told me I was fine and continued to buy me different skincare products she swore would work. Until one day at the dinner table, I remember breaking down, crying, and saying how disgusting I thought I looked. Only then did I think my mum realised how much my acne was affecting me. My first doctor’s consultation about my skin ended with a prescription for antibiotics. The antibiotics worked for the duration of the course, and I started to slowly feel better about myself during this time. But, a while after finishing the course, my acne started to come back. By this time, I was in my last year of Sixth Form (year 13). Luckily, the little confidence I had managed to rebuild while taking antibiotics didn’t completely disappear as soon as my acne reappeared. I think this was partly because I had developed a skincare routine that helped me manage my breakouts. I also think it was partly because I had seen more people with acne. At my new Sixth Form, I became close friends with someone who related to my skin struggles. She and I supported each other as we would aim to make each other feel good about ourselves. Not realising then that the way we spoke positively about one another should have also been the way we spoke about and viewed ourselves. Unfortunately, leaving Sixth Form and starting different universities away from familiar faces was the catalyst to eroding whatever healthy body image I had previously maintained. This was the second major time in my life that I recall wanting to change the skin I was in. So, in my second year of university, I found a skincare clinic in the city where I studied, which I thought would be the answer to all my skin ‘issues’. I justified the high amount of money they charged for cosmetic treatments as an investment and an opportunity to finally cure my acne. At the time, I didn’t even tell my family this was something I was doing. I didn’t realise how unhealthy my thoughts and perceptions of myself were. I just wanted to improve what I saw at the time as a flaw. I paid for multiple sessions of facial acid peels. Yes, cosmetic-grade acid was applied to my face with the intent of clearing up my acne and fading the hyperpigmentation I had developed from previous breakouts. There was a recovery time required after each round of treatment. So, I spent days avoiding the sun, not going to lectures and even avoiding the library. This meant that I was inadvertently consumed with my appearance, hoping to achieve ‘perfect’ skin and build an ‘ideal’ body image. Lo and behold, after a few months of treatment and most of the academic year, my acne remained uncured. Writing about my experience now has helped me to see how this experience likely affected my grades, as my lowest grades were in my second year. Upon reflection, I’ve also realised that I was hugely isolating myself from my friends and flatmates. Sadly, an academic year of isolating myself in my room, obsessing over my skin and worrying about others seeing my face wasn’t enough to tire my chase for clear skin. I went on to pay for another course of treatments. I hoped that this would be the last hurdle to finally achieve what I thought I needed. It was not. Like clockwork, my acne would reappear a short while after treatment. At this point in my journey with my skin, I began to realise that this wasn’t the solution for me. Don’t get me wrong, I think there’s no problem with having facial peels, but I was focused so much on the aesthetics of my body that I hadn’t even addressed other factors that were possibly causing me to break out. What about the stress or pressure I was putting myself through? What about the hormonal changes my body was dealing with as a young woman? What about simply learning to love my skin? It took some time for me to get here, but I’m learning to be more accepting of my skin if I break out. It’s simply how my skin responds sometimes, and I shouldn’t feel ashamed. I have learned so much about myself throughout my journey in my own skin. I do my best to think and speak kindly of myself, as I would do for a friend. I know that I am not alone, and I can talk to a friend if my body image is affecting my life. My favourite takeaway from this journey is that I was introduced to the world of skincare. I’ve learned to indulge in skincare as a form of self-care and not self-sabotage. I’m no longer obsessed with trying to achieve an unrealistic image of pore-less, one-tone, texture-free skin. My interest in skincare has motivated me to practice looking after myself even during the times I’ve felt unhappy in my skin. Whatever our textures – skin, hair or any other part of our body – we can journey towards accepting ourselves instead of wanting to be something else.

If I can function, if I can wake up, go to work, if I can cook for my children without thinking"" ""You have to be really strong and ready to rebuild your life. But if you lost your well-being during the asylum process you might lose your future as well"" Meaningful compassion starts with understanding. 1. Volunteering ""I kept myself busy all the time. I volunteered… giving from my time - actually from my stressful time - to help others. But the return back for me was I built a little bit of resilience for myself, and all my day I was busy"" 2.

And they are kind-hearted. They really do help."" 1. Uncertainty and limbo ""The big problem is because they don't process our cases. The people are just waiting and waiting for a long time. No change. We lost hope. All of us."" 2. Stigma ""There are people who don't know you or don't know why you are here. They think that you just go steal their money, their jobs, their houses."" 3. Loneliness ""When I came here, I was lonely, I couldn’t see people. Even when I see people, I don't even know how scared, little bit afraid... a lot of shame through my head.

Forced poverty ""If you don't have enough money, how can you do well-being activity? The bus ticket is very expensive for me. And to be able to reach education places... so many places you could volunteer and keep yourself active and productive, and take your mind away."" 6. ‘Lost’ childhood ""Our kids don't grow up like other children. It means they don't have a home. OK, don't feel for us. We already ruined our life. But how about our kids? They don't know nothing. They don't deserve this."" 7.

Right to work ""The most important thing is if I can work."" ""You might be a teacher, a businessperson or an educationist. You shouldn't be left like that because this kills a lot."" 3. Equal opportunities ""The government has to look into all these areas where there is discrimination against asylum seekers, and people are deprived of so many rights and opportunities. They should look into those areas. And if those things are sorted, definitely the level of well-being would be highly increased."" 4.

But you can't do that on asylum support. So the government could be... putting those things in place... providing things that you know could help well-being in that sense."" 5. Building connections with local communities and volunteering ""Very important for the new arrivals to involve and not to isolate themselves... to be involved in local communities and networks. So we shouldn't isolate ourselves as well. We have to integrate. We have to ask… So, it's better to involve yourself in local communities and networks."" 6.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/articles/ten-top-tips-good-sleep,Ten top tips for good sleep,"Regularly getting a good night’s sleep is crucial to ensuring we enjoy good mental health. When we don’t get good sleep, it can contribute to various problems, including depression and anxiety. But it can sometimes feel hard to achieve amid the pressures of daily life. To help, we have come up with these top ten tips on how to get a good night’s sleep. The bedroom should be somewhere that we associate with sleep. Where possible, you should try to remove distractions from your bedroom. It is better to watch TV, check social media and eat in another room. This will allow you to relax with no distractions in your bedroom. Be mindful of the presence of gadgets and electronics, such as computers, phones, tablets and TVs. The backlit 'blue light' displays suppress melatonin production – the hormone that helps you sleep; the suppression of melatonin causes sleep disruption. You should stop using these devices two hours before you go to sleep to reduce their impact on your sleeping. Anyone who has tried to get to sleep with a blocked nose or headache knows that physical health problems can stop you from getting a good night's sleep. It can be easy to forget minor symptoms, but you will thank yourself when night falls if you prioritise speaking to a pharmacist about appropriate medication for symptom management. It may sound common sense, but too much light and background noise can prevent you from falling asleep or staying asleep. Eye masks or earplugs are wonderful investments for light and noise sources that you can’t control. Temperature is also important, and if you share a bed with a partner with different temperature preferences, consider separate blankets or other solutions that compromise less sleep. Thinking about sleeping too much or forcing yourself to sleep will only keep you awake. Learning how to relax your body and mind instead will help you get to sleep much more easily. Progressive relaxation techniques can help you to relax and unwind at these times. Eating rice, oats and dairy products can produce chemicals that increase our desire to sleep. As well as the obvious caffeine, in terms of food and drink to avoid, things high in sugar can keep you awake if consumed late in the day. A big meal after mid-evening can also stop you from sleeping. Although it can make you feel tired and can help you get to sleep, alcohol often impairs the quality of your sleep and makes you more likely to wake up during the night as the effects wear off, and you may need to go to the toilet frequently or wake up dehydrated to drink water. Exercising regularly can help us sleep, helping to reduce anxiety and relieve stress. Exercising earlier in the day is better, as exercise increases the body’s adrenaline production, making it more difficult to sleep if done just before bedtime. If you have trouble sleeping, you may be tempted to catch up on sleep by napping. However, unless you’re feeling dangerously sleepy (while driving or operating machinery, for instance), this usually does more harm than good as it makes it more difficult to sleep at night. If you feel tired during the day, get up and walk around, get some fresh air, or do something challenging for a short while, like a crossword or sudoku. If you’re finding it difficult to get to sleep, don't just lie there worrying. Get up for a while and drink (no sugar or caffeine, remember!). Try reading for a little while and go back to bed when you feel a bit sleepier. Keeping a sleep diary to note the conditions when you went to bed the night before can be useful for letting you look back and see what has and what hasn’t worked for you. It also helps you to see how your sleep varies from night to night and might help you note sleep patterns. Home of Mental Health Awareness Week"

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/articles/supporting-partner-depression,Supporting a partner with depression,"This content mentions depression, which some people may find triggering. Depressioncan cause people to withdraw, behave differently or become more irritable. Common symptoms includeinsomnia, feelings of worthlessness and loss of interest in activities. It can even lead to physical aches and pains. Living with depression for a longer period of time can take a toll on your partner's levels of energy, motivation and passion. It's important not to take changes personally or as a reflection of your partner's investment in the relationship. “Be patient with them and try and go with the flow as much as possible. As hard and weird as that sounds.” Understanding how depression affects your partner can be key to building a healthy, supportive relationship that supports both people’s mental wellbeing. The suggestions below came from our supporters, after we asked about supporting a partner who is depressed. Thank you to everyone who responded. Depression, like many mental health problems, can take over your life. It’s important to remember and remind your partner that the depression diagnosis is only a part of their identity. They also have many other roles and interests. Being able to fulfil these roles is a big part of recovery. We know that exercise and staying active can protect our mental health. You may like to suggest going for a walk or visiting your favourite places. Keep trying but don’t push too much if they aren’t ready to join you. You may notice gradual changes in their mood, rather than a massive improvement from one moment to the next. “Be understanding and listen.” Watching a loved one go through a difficult time may leave you searching for the perfect solution. Practical advice and tips can help, but sometimes rather than trying to 'fix a problem', it's better to listen to your partner. Be a safe place for them to turn to. Don’t dismiss their feelings. Offer hope and remind them of better days and that it’s likely that things will improve again. “Try not to take to heart the negativity around you and make sure you get to have a break.” Being the main source of support for a partner living with depression can add a lot of pressure on you. It's important to look after yourself and ask for support when you need it. Opening up conversations to your friends and families and getting them involved usually makes a big difference in tackling the stigma and building a circle of support for both of you. Good communication with your partner is very important – remember that your needs and opinions should be met and respected too. “Get educated and encourage professional help.” Gaining knowledge will help you guide your partner through their depression, but gently encouraging them to seek out professional help does not mean you have failed. Rather, understand that your partner may need care that you don’t have the tools to provide. “Let them know that you love them no less because of it.” Living with depression can be exhausting and isolating. It helps to know that someone cares for and supports you, no matter what. If you feel affected by the content you have read, please see ourget helppage for support. 24th Oct 2025

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/articles/relationships-work-our-top-tips-managers,Relationships at work: our top tips for managers,"Relationships and the workplace conjures up an image of stationery cupboard trysts and forms for HR that declare that two colleagues are ‘an item’. We know that work that is challenging, rewarding and validating is one of the most valuable ways to improve our mental health. We also know that work-relatedstress, poor line management, badly managed change, bullying and discrimination quickly take a toll on our mental health. Work gives us a purpose, a role, financial means and status. It also gives us social relationships, and, as this week’s report on21st Century relationshipsshows, social contact may be as important a mediator of health outcomes as obesity orsmoking. Luckily, the principles of good management and good business practice are, by and large, principles which contribute to the development of amentally healthy workplace. So how do the top tips forhealthy relationshipsapply to working life, and in particular to the line management relationship? Time is money. Time is precious. There’s not enough time in the day. Time is a constant theme in modern workplaces. As managers, we are now under more pressure than ever to deliver, develop and to ensure delivery from our teams. There has never been a more important time to create an environment in which people can succeed, and feel supported. We all recognise the pull of the smartphone vibrating on the table or the creeping thoughts of the next meeting. It is key to focus on the task in hand, especially when that is investing in one-to-one time with colleagues, or attending a meeting or presentation. Listening is vital for every relationship. Listening and hearing are different. We listen passively to all sorts of things, including what our colleagues tell us. If we switch from passively taking stuff in to actively listening and hearing what is being said, the quality of the conversation increases dramatically. This is good for productivity, and vital for having conversations about mental health at work. The line management relationship is likely to be the context in which concerns about wellbeing, performance or progress arise. This means that line managers are uniquely placed to recognise distress. First contact is key when someone isn’t coping. They are likely to feel embarrassed, ashamed or nervous bringing it up at work. If you respond in an open, supportive way, you can set a pattern that helps themseek supportand feel less apprehensive. First and foremost, people who aren’t coping, for whatever reason, want and need a compassionate, human response. That connection can then lead to practical support at work and referral or signposting to internal and external sources of expert advice. So how do we have those conversations? We all recognise unhelpful relationships, whether it’s friendships or personal relationships. Home of Mental Health Awareness Week"
https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/shannons-story-power-mentorship-feeling-connected-university,Power of mentorship in feeling connected to university,"This content mentions loneliness or isolation, which some people may find triggering. Shannon began her university studies during the Covid pandemic. This had a large impact on her feeling connected to the university and her peers. In this piece Shannon writes about how creating a mentorship network helped her feel connected and empowered to others. From school, we were told that university is a time of joy. We were told we’d be with hundreds of people from a plethora of cultures and it’s the most exciting time of our life. Almost like those institutions in your favourite TV shows, with the vibrancy and excitement from all the newbies beginning their first step into independent life! September 20th, 2020, the day I walked into halls, there was not a sound. The excitement and bustle of sixth form changed to a silent room. All I had was a laptop showing muted voices and faceless screens. I questioned how I would organically connect with others? For over half of my degree that sense of humanity wasn’t tangible, from genuine laughter to the depth of conversation and the energy that feeds between persons. How do I stay inspired, motivated, and connected in this altered world? The bleakness of the pandemic drove nihilism, but I tried to remain optimistic. I learned to appreciate the quietness it provided for introspection; to deeply reflect on my purpose and value at university and to understand to how to flourish in this unknown space. It is much easier said than done to embark on the journey of self-empowerment. It doesn’t happen overnight. There is a multilayering of what shapes and drives us. As an Indo-Caribbean woman from Hackney, who is heavily underrepresented in the academic space, there was so much to unpack. I started to reflect on the times that I felt that I was my thriving self, and what had prompted that. I was someone with such drive and enthusiasm to enter new spaces, such as insight sessions and conferences to contribute to positive change in my society. I was incredibly determined to broaden my global awareness and research topics that I was fascinated by. I planned to create a blog space to enlighten myself and those around me about the intricacies of life. I reflected that much of my ability and confidence to grow and to develop a thriving mindset stemmed from being in a supportive, uplifting environment. Community mentorship was the most pivotal tool throughout my life, that shaped my self-belief and drive to want to flourish. In moving away from home, I was in a new space, way of life and culture. I hardly found those from a similar background as me, but I knew there were pockets of us dotted across campus! I looked around at the varying university initiatives that provided a space for mentorship and while they were incredible, in being a covid starter, I found it difficult to wholly immerse myself into my institution. The key to mentorship is identification, finding the network and connecting with someone with whom you can see yourself in. It was about that sense of relatability of lived experience, to discuss intricate themes on overcoming imposter syndrome, belonging and recognising your self-worth; that will differ between groups and cultures. The beauty of university is that when you meet one person who is like you, it leaves a trail to connect with more like-minded students. I also reconnected with my friends at home, and unsurprisingly, all related to the feeling of alienation. I was determined to create a central space to connect us across the map, especially as there aren’t very many of us in the academic world. So, I created a group, external from my institution but united the most underrepresented students on a national basis. We shaped a comfortable, protected, and empowering virtual space to feel like we are in the room together. The unity of like-minded students, with similar journeys and experiences, in one area, inspiring and relating to one another, and introspecting together created a snowball effect. Students further connected with and checked on friends and supported those alike at their respective institutions. This is how we get through it together. There is no age, pace, or structure to mentorship; the key is to make it your own and be in a space that inspires, understands, and empowers you; allowing you to grow and flourish in your university journey.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/morgans-story-my-experience-shared-housing-and-feelings-isolation-university,Morgan’s story: My experience with shared housing and feelings of isolation at university,"This content mentions loneliness or isolation, which some people may find triggering. Morgan is a current university student who had a difficult time when living in shared university housing. Morgan talks about her experience to reassure you, you are not alone if you are going through similar struggles. When you speak to people about their experiences at university, you usually get a mixture of exam stress, drinking stories, and gushing about new friends. But are we all being honest with each other? I know that I probably haven’t been. My first and second years of university have been some of the most isolating periods of my life, I didn’t know how to get through them… but I now know that we can get through this together. I started my first year of university in September 2021, freshly 19, and just getting over the effects of covid on my education – as well as the effects on my social life. I remember a mixture of excitement, and nausea, and an overwhelming sense of freedom I’d never experienced before. However, this freedom brought with it a sense of isolation. I never gelled properly with my flatmates, and I felt awkward around new people. It was the first time I’d had to make new friends in years! However, on my first proper day at university I met some cool people I could see myself being friends with. I felt completely settled for a few weeks; but with the darker and colder months coming in, my nights in Manchester became more and more isolating and my mood was more and more low. I moved home and began commuting in the second semester of my first year and felt a lot happier. However, I got a house with my friends from university and was determined to start fresh in my second year and make more of an effort. I applied for a position as a Peer Assisted Learning (PAL) Leader and tried my best to get more involved in my department. I was successful and felt excited to meet my colleagues in September. When I moved into my house with my friends from first year, it was not at all what I expected. Living with people is very different to being friends with them! All of my housemates dropped out of university, and I felt like I stuck out like a sore thumb in the house with them. My experience in the house upset me because I wanted the full university house experience of living with your best friends. I wanted to be doing everything together, but I soon realised that people don’t always have the same experiences of university living. I learnt that you need to find the best in every situation. I joined societies and spent more time with different people up at university and soon found a great support system in my friends and colleagues on the PAL scheme, as well as the wider university. It can feel very difficult to start fresh at university and find your balance while you feel isolated. But there is hope, and there are so many people in the same boat as you. Even if none of us talk about it! We can get through this together. If you've been affected by this content, please visit ourget helppage for support.

Sheneika lived at home while she completed her degree. This came with difficulties when trying to be part of the wider university community. Here are her tips on how to cope as a commuting student. As a commuting student, it can be easy to feel isolated and shut off from campus/ community life. The start times of student and society events can make participation feel unachievable. This can lessen the university experience and isolate us from the benefits of extracurricular experiences. Experiences such as networking, stress relief, personal growth, cultural exposure and leadership opportunities can create long lasting friendships. Throughout my degree I was determined to have these experiences despite commuting for the three years of my degree (minus the Covid year). These are the steps I took to integrate myself in university life: If you find yourself struggling with your mental health at university, the best advice we can give is to tell someone.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/articles/eloises-story-helping-friendships-flourish-university-student,Eloise's story: helping friendships flourish as a university student,"University student Eloise shares tips about making and maintaining friends when starting university. Making friends is never easy in any situation, especially in the post-Covid generation, and maintaining them is another story. We adjusted to seeing people on screen and meeting through online situations, only to be thrust back into overly social settings that have all our social batteries exhausted. Paired with the increase in mental health problems such as anxiety from exams, sometimes we feel like we can’t express problems to the ones we end up closest to. You might find that you don’t feel like yourself and your friends might ultimately get to know a person that you’re not, that’s how I felt. Helping a friendship flourish and grow is much like tending to a plant, and this is the kind of motif I like to use. Maintaining relationships requires care, patience, compassion, but also time away and for yourself. The most important part about starting a friendship is that you feel comfortable with them. It is completely understandable that you might be nervous or anxious about beginning new friendships, so having some things in common such as shows you watch or things you enjoy doing is always a nice thing to circle back to if you begin to feel anxious. Good ways to meet new friends could be through: Friends are everywhere, and often no matter where you are, you will always have someone who needs another person to rely on. Friendships are important to maintain and flourish, to keep things healthy and safe. A friendship will bloom on its own, but negative thoughts and insecurities can get in the way of this. Here I have also shared some tips for how to best strengthen and blossom your friendships: Like a plant, friendships need to be maintained consistently or they will wilt. Check in with your friends to see if they need alone time, some support, or something to do to distract them. Here are some more tips for keeping your friends happy and healthy.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/black-maternal-mental-health,Black maternal mental health,"This content mentions depression, which some people may find triggering. Every mother, including Black mums, deserves good mental health and the support and care they need during pregnancy and after childbirth. Yet Black mothers experience unique challenges that contribute to higher rates of mental health issues, including anxiety, depression and other mood disorders.  They also face greater barriers to accessing mental health care. It’s vital that their stories are heard and action is taken to tackle the mental health disparities Black mothers face. Yet too often, their experiences are overlooked and under addressed. We recognise a clear difference in outcomes for Black mothers in their perinatal experience compared to many other mothers across the UK. Mental health stigma and feeling judged and unheard are common barriers faced by Black mothers during pregnancy and early parenthood. Getting support does not always feel like a realistic option for mothers. One-fifth of Black mothers reported they didn’t visit healthcare professionals to talk about their low mood and depression [1]. In the UK, ethnic minority groups are more likely to present with mental health problems, while their mental health needs are less likely to be detected. It is vital that all of us in society make sure that we support women who may be silently struggling in their perinatal experience. As part of our aim to spotlight seldom-heard voices in the perinatal experience, we are proudly supporting Black Maternal Mental Health Week, a national campaign led byThe Motherhood Group. This year, it takes place from 25 September to 1 October, and the theme is “Breaking Cultural Barriers”. Black mothers are disproportionately affected by cultural barriers that hinder their access to mental health care. This campaign shines a light on the unique challenges facing Black maternal mental health, due to factors such as historical trauma, racial discrimination, and limited access to culturally competent care. And it calls on us to address and break these barriers, to ensure the wellbeing of Black mothers and their children. Get involved with Black Maternal Mental Health Week by following us onInstagramor check out The Motherhood Group’sevents and resources. We promote workforce development, supportive peer networks and a shared understanding of the best practice, through ourYoung Mums ConnectandAmplifying Maternal Voicesprogrammes. These projects are funded by our Covid Response Programme, informed by the Foundation’s participation in the ‘Mental Health in the Pandemic’ research. The NHS has also recognised a need for more tailored support with a plan that, by 2024, 75% of women from minority ethnic communities will receive continuity of care throughout pregnancy and the post-natal period. Overall, this will improve Black mothers’ experiences of care, and their perinatal mental health outcomes. However, this is just a starting point. It’s vital that every woman receives continuity of care through their perinatal journey, allowing for better physical and mental health outcomes for mothers and their babies. Through this equity of care, we will start to see reductions in pre-term births, hospital admissions and the need for emergency intervention during labour for Black mothers. It is time for Black mothers’ voices to have greater influence in the care they receive, including setting commissioning priorities and informing the workforce. Young Mums Connect programme In partnership withThe Motherhood GroupandNottingham City Council, we lead the Young Mums Connect programme. This work focuses on the unique needs and experiences of young mothers and their babies. Through this programme we’ve rolled out an evidence-based model for mothers and babies that includes: Amplifying Maternal Voices project In partnership with theMaternal Mental Health Alliance, theAmplifying Maternal Voicesproject highlights the perinatal mental health experience of women and their families from ‘seldom-heard’ communities. It focuses on women with diverse needs, including including young mothers, single mothers and mothers from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic communities. The project provides these women with greater access to influencing care, commissioning priorities, and informing workforce development through thetoolkit. It also aims to increase knowledge and awareness of the impact of inequalities on perinatal outcomes for women, babies and families within perinatal service providers. Through this work we aim to achieve equal mental healthcare for all pregnant women and new mothers who need support. Black mothers deserve their voices to be heard. Support Black maternal mental health by listening to and sharing their stories during Black Maternal Mental Health Week and beyond. Anisah shares her different birth experiences and how she found the maternity system. ""I believe the key factor in providing equal outcomes for Black women is having the ability to advocate for yourself or having someone who you trust to do so on your behalf."" Advocate for yourself, friends or loved ones. Support Black maternal mental health by advocating for yourself, or supporting friends or loved ones that may not be receiving the support they deserve. Check in on your friends or family member’s wellbeing during and after their pregnancy. A listening ear and the right support can make such a difference. Jessica shares the challenges she faced as a pregnant Black women going through maternal care in the UK. ""My advice is to advocate for yourself, or be a listening ear for your friends and family as the support can go a long way.""

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/islamophobia-and-my-mental-health-osamas-story,Islamophobia and my mental health: Osama's story,"Osama, a Mental Health FoundationYoung Leader, shares his story to help promote awareness of Islamophobia and the impact it can have on your mental health. Content warning: this blog mentions depression and suicidal feelings, please read with care. I am sure we all believe that the United Kingdom is an inclusive and welcoming country. We have made strides. However, I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news. We are far from that. One way I’ve seen this most starkly is in the Islamophobia that sadly remains widespread in British society. Islamophobia is rooted in racism and is a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness. This definition created by the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on British Muslims is used widely, with the notable exception of the government. This definition helps with public understanding of Islamophobia and allows us to talk about it in a more informed and considerate manner. There are worrying views and social attitudes towards Muslims in British society. These statistics show the prevalence of anti-Muslim sentiment in the UK. These sentiments lay the foundations for other forms of Islamophobia, including harassment and violence. When we look across the UK at instances of Islamophobic hate crime, we can see that this has been increasing. These figures are bound to be higher when you consider how likely people are to report this, for reasons like distrusting the system. These statistics alone are shocking enough for change. However, nothing has really changed, just words and no real action. Looking at this from my personal experience, Islamophobia has been impacting my life and my mental health since primary school. For example, in school someone said I had a bomb in my bag and threw it in the bin.  Another time, they told people not to be my friend or go near me as I was a terrorist. What happened in school affected my mental health greatly. I felt rejected and isolated and it messed with my self-confidence. Having fewer friends meant more isolation and feelings of helplessness which led me to havedepressionandsuicidal thoughts, which is still affecting me, and brought on my persisting socialanxiety. The support was non-existent then and sadly I know it's the same now as my 16-year-old sister faced Islamophobia in school recently. It wasn’t just my mental health that it affected. It also made me change who I am. Like becoming an atheist, drinking alcohol, getting tattoos – all to try to look and seem more “normal” and to show I’m not that different, that I’m not a Muslim. I even went by Sam. More needs to be done to address Islamophobia in schools to make it a safe and encouraging environment that will enable Muslim students to thrive in education. Also, people of authority like teachers, police etc. need Islamophobia awareness training to better understand and help people rather than being dismissive and not being sure how to help. What really helped me finally talk about this and open up about my experience was the fact that I want to make positive change and help as many people as I can.  Also, I realised that the vast majority of people are not full of hate but love. People just need to understand and learn more, which I hope this Islamophobia awareness month is successful in doing. Islamophobia is never okay. If you experience it in any form, remember that how you feel matters and you deserve support. It can help to talk to someone about it, whether it’s someone you know or by calling a support line.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/phils-story-becoming-peer-educator-young-leader,Phil's story: becoming a Peer Educator & Young Leader,"Hello, I’m Phil and I am a Young Leader for the Mental Health Foundation and two years ago I took part in the Peer Education Project (PEP).  I found the PEP project to be a very rewarding experience as a Peer Educator. In the final 2 weeks of year 12, I was selected to be one of the educators, and we went through a day of training. During this session, we covered an overview of the entire programme, but we also learned key skills that were of use during the delivery of the lessons in the next academic year. For me, the classroom management skills became very useful. Taking part as a Peer Educator made me realize that I was interested in a career in teaching. I have been able to further these skills in part-time work alongside my University degree, by working in and out of schools as a tutor and working for my University on outreach visit days. The Peer Education Project realized this passion inside of me, and for that, I will always be grateful.  Furthermore, PEP is why I am here now. After the completion of the project, I was shown an advert for the Mental Health Foundation’s Young Leaders programme, and I applied. It's safe to say that I got the position and here I am. I have done some fantastic things as a Young Leader and I have learnt a great deal about not only my mental health but how to raise awareness for mental health in my communities. In particular, I was given a chance to contribute to the PEP project last year. I wrote up a Mindfulness exercise. The objective of the exercise was to allow participants to reflect on themselves and place themselves in a scenario that they entirely control. I felt very proud and honoured to be able to contribute to the project physically after it had changed my life so clearly. The project also gave me a chance to connect with my peers in sixth form. I moved to a sixth-form college for my A-Level studies, one of only a few new people to attend (most carried on from high school). I ultimately found the experience to be quite lonely as I am quite a shy, introverted person with social anxieties. But, the project allowed me to make friendships with my peer educators that last to this day and gave me the public speaking skills and confidence that have led me into a place of leadership in and outside of my University studies.  In short, I am very grateful for my time as a Young Leader, and I look back upon my time and experience fondly. I believe that the programme raises the awareness of mental health better than any other I have seen, simply because student engagement is so high. The pupils I engaged with were keen and interested to speak to me and my peers and we had meaningful and fulfilling conversations. If you are considering becoming a Peer Educator, go for it! You will gain lifelong skills and have experiences like no other. Home of Mental Health Awareness Week"

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/young-mums-standing-stigma,Young mums standing up to stigma,"There are many ups and downs, joys, and challenges that come with being a parent. And through it all, it’s vital that parents look after their mental health. As the saying goes, you can’t pour from an empty cup. This feels especially true for parents, who continuously pour love and care into their children. As a parent, you can face all kinds of challenges to your mental health. One challenge shared by many parents is stigma. Stigma describes negative attitudes and beliefs about certain groups of people. Experiencing stigma can feel isolating and lonely. It might stop you from sharing your feelings or reaching out for support, often because of feelings of shame or fear of judgment. Two inspiring young mums share their experiences of stigma, offer advice to other young mums, and share what’s helped them look after their mental health and wellbeing throughout their children’s early years. Jayde:  ""Having my son at 15, I was always afraid to attend the GP or any healthcare setting as they would always ask me if I had a social worker. It often felt like they assumed that because I looked so young, I required additional support. Or they assumed that I was not coping, which in fact was far from the case. ""One situation was when my son jumped off the sofa and banged his head quite hard and I rushed him to A&E. Most parents would be able to relate with the fact that some toddlers truly believe they are Spiderman, and in this case that’s exactly what my son thought.  ""As soon as I rushed in, I was in such a panic that I was begging for help. I remember going into the room and one of the immediate questions was, 'do you have a social worker', even before asking how it had happened. ""This made me feel like I couldn’t even trust the nurse and that she didn’t believe that I have a 3-year-old child that was just playing around. Instead, it felt like I had done that to him."" Raiye:  ""I have experienced stigma within the healthcare system on many occasions. An example would be when we were sent to another GP for an emergency appointment, when our registered practice had no appointments available.We went because my son Rome was experiencing extremely dry lips due to the change in season.  When we arrived, Rome was quite distressed as he has negative feelings about seeing the GP. Also, due to our period of housing problems he was suffering from lack of sleep and our appointment was at 5pm. ""I encouraged him to enter the room and had many looks from the reception staff. When Rome responded to this by saying, 'what are you looking at?', the staff began to whisper amongst themselves. My son has neurodivergent needs and instead of acting out of compassion, they viewed my son’s tantrum as amusing. ""In the doctor’s room Rome began to cover his mouth and giggled. The doctor was not impressed by Rome’s friendly personality and seemed as though she wanted to be done with the appointment. She said it was simply a dehydration problem and subscribed any prescription ointment without physically seeing his lips. ""When I explained to Rome it was time to leave, he threw a tantrum as he struggles with transitions. The doctor continued to rush us, explaining that she had someone else to see. Rome believed he had done something wrong and said, 'I was just playing'. I simply responded by saying, 'I know it’s not your fault'. The doctor responded to this by asking if we have support at home. I asked what she meant by that, and she responded to ask if his dad was around. I explained I was a voluntary single parent and I don’t need support at home as my child is not difficult. I immediately left feeling so judge, ridiculed & humiliated."" Jayde: ""For a long time, mental health was a topic I would never speak to family and friends about, often because I wanted to put on a ‘show’ that I was doing fine as a young mum.""It was the fear of being judged as a failure mum, as well as because it would be dismissed with responses such as ‘get on with it’ or ‘what do you expect being a young mum’.""As I grew in age and began to seek support for my mental health, I soon realised that mental health is not just about bad days. It’s simply about the state of your mind. Once I understood this, I gained the confidence to help others. And I found that speaking to others about how they’re feeling also helped me to feel better and greater about myself."" Raiye: ""I have explained to an (ex) friend in the past I wanted to move home as our living conditions were extremely bad and I was saving for a home. She laughed and said I would be 'nothing but a council estate baby mum'. ""On occasions when I explained to my mum I needed a break and I was sleep deprived, she responded by saying things like, 'welcome to motherhood', 'welcome to the club', 'that’s why you shouldn’t lay on your back', and 'you will know not to go have another one'. This completely changed my mind about having more children. It also made me believe motherhood was a never-ending pool of sacrifices and I didn’t deserve time to myself or basic needs such as sleep.""  Jayde: ""I think it’s important when supporting young parents to empower them through reminding them of all the good things they are doing. Being a parent regardless of age comes with struggles and it shouldn’t be because we are young that’s all we speak about. ""I would also encourage professionals, friends and family to not be afraid to be supportive but be conscious when you are telling young parents what to do through assumptions. ""It’s important to even remind yourself that parenthood is a journey and see yourself as the person suited to support and show compassion."" Raiye:  ""It would help if people shared positive experiences of parenting, rather than constantly focusing on the negative. They could give practical advice on strategies that helped them navigate parenthood such as sleep tips, eating habits, or supplements they take that help them. They could also remind them that they are doing amazing and highlight the good things they do."" Jayde: ""I think health professionals, as great as they are, should sometimes put their ‘professional hat’ away and just be a human with a heart and understanding.""Taking the time to listen and not assume can go a long way, especially when speaking about mental health."" Raiye:  ""Professionals should be thoughtful in their speech and voice questions in a gracious and respectful manner.They should notmake assumptions, and ask questions to gain a better understanding of the individual they are dealing with. And they should manage their time to avoid making patients feel rushed."" We asked Jayde and Raiye to share what's helped them look after their mental health in the face of stigma. Here's what they said: We asked Raiye and Jayde what they'd say to other young parents like them, who are struggling with stigma. Here's what they said:  Home of Mental Health Awareness Week"
https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/solo-row-across-atlantic-mental-health-ananyas-story,Solo row across the Atlantic for mental health: Ananya’s story,"Ananya aims to be the first woman of colour to row solo and unsupported across any ocean. She hopes to encourage more diversity in adventure sport and rowing, for everyone, but especially for women and minority groups. Donate now Ananya hopes her inspiring voyage can encourage people to try new things, take on challenges outside our comfort zones, and feel the benefits of exercise and adventure. Ananya grew up with a love of the outdoors and new activities, and aware of the positive impact of the natural environment and physical challenges on her own mental health. “I’ve always loved the great outdoors, new adventures and trying new activities. Whether that was learning to skydive solo, kayaking, trekking, rock climbing or mountaineering, adventure sport is something I’ve been lucky enough to try. “However, lack of diversity in adventure sport has always been very apparent to me. While there are a myriad of reasons for this, I hope to inspire more people of colour and women into adventure sport and rowing and offer some representation to the outdoors for women of colour. “So far fewer than 25 women have rowed solo across an ocean and I would become the first woman of colour to do this solo.” ""By participating, I hope that one day that women and people of colour in adventure sport isn’t something distinctive, but normal.”  TheWorld’s Toughest Row (Atlantic)runs annually in December, where amateur rowers of all ages and nationalities row 3000 miles from La Gomera to Antigua in teams or alone. “As a solo rower, I’ll be rowing in a specially built ocean rowing boat fit for purpose, built to withstand the tough marine environment. Like all adventure sports, ocean rowing is not without its risk. “All teams are supported 24/7 via satellite phone by the race’s land-based duty officers and two safety yachts in case of emergency. I will also be required to complete several safety courses to prepare for the row.” Ananya will row in her boat 'Odysseus', a specially built 25ft ocean rowing boat, designed to withstand the tough marine environment. Fully carbon neutral and self-sufficient, solar panels on the boat power all electronics and water desalinator, rowing is the only way forward! She will face 30ft waves, sleep deprivation, isolation and the forces of the ocean for approximately 60 days, making this as much a mental challenge as a physical one! We’ll let you know about her training, and her upcoming adventure, over the coming months. Born in India and raised in the UK, Ananya is an economics student at Sheffield University and lives in the city. As you might expect, Ananya has a passion for exercise, the outdoors and adventure. Having experienced the mental health benefits of adventure sports, she hopes to inspire others to try it themselves. Ananya is also a passionate mental health advocate, previously raising money to support our work at the Mental Health Foundation. This time, Ananya’s goal is to raise an incredible £75,000 to fund our vital work in mental health. “Mental health is still unfairly stigmatised in a way that physical health is not, even as mental illness rates continue to raise globally. I think tackling stigma of mental health is crucial to help improve mental health for all. “Mental health is not just a concern for a few; just as we're all susceptible to physical illness, regardless of background or circumstance, mental health can affect everyone. “Personally, poor mental health is something I’ve struggled with myself and have experienced how the outdoors can have a profound impact on my own mental state. “Despite mental health concerns become more common and having friends and family members who have dealt with their own mental health challenges, it can still be it can be difficult for the majority of people to speak about, especially in the Asian community. “I chose to fundraise for the MHF as they work to change social perceptions around mental health, which is a key barrier to tackling rising mental illness rates. While the majority of resources are directed toward treating mental illness, the Mental Health Foundation focuses on research & prevention of mental ill-health through community led initiatives.” Donate now Home of Mental Health Awareness Week"
https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/mental-health-asylum-seekers-and-refugees-uk,The mental health of asylum seekers and refugees in the UK,"This report presents evidence on the circumstances which asylum seekers and refugees in the UK can face, and how these experiences can harm their mental health and even lead to suicidal feelings and actions. Asylum seekers and refugees are at particular risk of mental health problems. These may develop because of their experiences in their countries of origin, during their journeys, or after they arrive in the UK. Read our report to understand why asylum seekers and refugees are at particular risk and what we, as a society, can do to protect their mental health once they arrive in the UK. Last update: April 2025 Read the report Note: this report includes non-graphic references to suicide, sexual abuse, and torture. This report presents evidence on the economic, social, and cultural circumstances which asylum seekers and refugees who seek sanctuary in the UK can face. We take an approach rooted in the discipline of public mental health. Public mental health is the improvement of mental health and wellbeing through preventative work involving communities, organisations, and individuals. Evidence is gathered from research, from people with lived experience of seeking refuge and asylum in the UK, and from the Mental Health Foundation’s programmes and other third-sector organisations who work with asylum seekers and refugees. Read the full research context inour report. In the report, we set out the UK policy context to shed light on the circumstances which refugees and asylum seekers in the UK can face. This context includes the international human rights obligations of the UK relevant to refugees and asylum seekers. We also look at the significant variations within the UK in how respective national governments regard asylum seekers and refugees. For example, in England there is no UK government-led integration strategy, in contrast to in Scotland and Wales. We also refer to a major part of the UK’s policy on immigration known as the ‘hostile environment’ policy, describing an approach that sought to deter people arriving irregularly from entering the UK. The UK government introduced measures to reduce the number of migrants in the UK with no right to remain. These pieces of legislation have contributed to the ‘hostile environment’ agenda and have had a profoundly negative impact on the lives of migrants [1]. Read the full UK policy context inour report. Asylum seekers and refugees face many barriers to achieving and sustaining good mental health, as their pre-and post-migration experiences place them at higher risk of experiencing mental health problems. Pre-migration experiences may include torture, war, imprisonment, physical assault, sexual assault, loss of livelihood, and losing close family or friends [2].​ Trauma may also be experienced on migrants’ journeys to the UK, which are sometimes long and perilous. In addition to the distress these experiences cause, they can exacerbate existing mental health conditions and lead to the development of new ones. Exposure to violence and trauma increases migrants’ risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [3][4],​ ​ they are more likely to experience depression [5][6],​ and anxiety disorders [7],​​ and are a high-risk group for suicidal ideation [8].​​ Internationally, around 30% of refugees and asylum seekers have been found to experience PTSD, with the figure for those experiencing depression also around 30%. [9]. The social and economic conditions in which they live post-migration can have an equally powerful influence on their mental health. Experiences of poverty, financial insecurity, unemployment, lack of adequate housing, social isolation, loneliness, prejudice, stigma, and discrimination all carry a higher risk of poor mental health [10],​ and asylum seekers and refugees are at higher risk of experiencing all these inequalities. Asylum seekers will also often be dealing with stress about the status of their claim and challenges in accessing healthcare. The UK government, devolved administrations, and local authorities have the power – and the responsibility – to address these social determinants of poor mental health, both directly and through supporting the third sector. This report sets out how they can work together to create a society that respects the dignity of asylum seekersand refugees and provides the building blocks that underpin good mental health. In our report, we make the case for a trauma-informed and person-centred approach to asylum claim processes, housing, education, health and care provision experienced by asylum seekers and refugees. We also address the urgent need for greater support for asylum seekers’ and refugees’ integration into their communities in the UK, and propose changes to existing government policies and public service practices to avoid the risk of re-traumatisation and other harms to the mental health of those seeking asylum and refuge. Many of the systems and processes in the UK do not work well for asylum seekers and refugees. The report makes policy and practice recommendations as to how systems and processes could be reconfigured to do no further harm to people who have come here to make a new life after fleeing war, persecution, sexual violence, and other deeply traumatic experiences. It sets out how we could take a compassionate approach to better supporting their mental health, limit the severity of the mental health problems many experience, and reduce the risk of them taking their own lives.  Our policy and practice recommendations for protecting the mental health of refugees and asylum seekers come under these main areas. Read our recommendation inthe report.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/articles/tips-looking-after-your-mental-health-during-ramadan,Tips for looking after your mental health during Ramadan,"The holy month of Ramadan is a time of spiritual practice and deepening your relationship with God. Throughout Ramadan, people reflect on the stories and lessons of the Qur’an, as well as exploring how this applies to your own life. It is the holiest month of the Islamic calendar, and a time many look forward to. “Ramadan is a month to cleanse my soul and body and detox my brain from all negative thoughts and behaviours”. During Ramadan, you may make significant changes to your habits and routine. This includes fasting, prayer, and studying the Qur’an. You may also spend more time with your family, friends and community, and practicing good deeds and charitable giving. The changes you make during Ramadan can affect your mental health in different ways. For example, connecting with your family, friends and community can boost your wellbeing and happiness. Your mental health during Ramadan might also be influenced by other important things happening in your life, or changes in your circumstances. To get the most from Ramadan, it’s important to look after your mental health. Physical and mental health are closely linked. Looking after your body can help your mind, just as looking after your mind can help your body. Eat healthily:The food you eat can greatly affect your mood. So, eating a healthy, well-balanced diet is crucial for good mental health. During Ramadan, when you usually have a shorter window to eat during night-time hours, it’s important to make sure you’re getting a balanced diet, including slow-energy releasing foods. Read the information and tips on having a healthy Ramadan from theBritish Nutrition Foundation. Don’t forget water:We all know how easy it is to forget to drink enough water. And this can be especially the hard when you’re fasting. Something that can help with this is keeping track of how much you’re drinking. Some people find a water bottle with measurements helpful for this. It can also help to write down how much you drink. If you’re caring for someone with an eating disorder during Ramadan, you may be interested in the eating disorder charity BEAT’s free course,Coping with celebrations: Ramadan. They also offer ahelpline, open 7 days a week, 3pm to 8pm. Night-time prayer and timings for eating during night-time hours can often have an impact on your sleep. This will particularly affect those of you who are unable to change your routine to sleep during the day, and therefore need to eat, pray and sleep during an often short window of night-time hours. It’s important to be mindful of how this will affect your energy when you plan your time. You might find it helpful to nap during the day, and/or taking breaks more regularly if you’re working or studying, for example. If changing your routine means you’re struggling to sleep, take a look at our guide to sleeping better. Ramadan is a time to connect with your family, friends, and community. There are many opportunities to get together and connect with others, whether to share meals or pray and learn with each other. Relationships can have a significant affect on your mental health. People who are more socially connected to family, friends, or their community arehappier, physically healthier and live longer, with fewer mental health problems than people who are less well connected. During Ramadan, the mosque is a great place to come together, where you’ll be welcome whether you come alone or with others. You can go to the mosque for prayers as well as for iftar. If you’re not able to go to the mosque, another way to feel connected to your community is to watch or listen to prayers and teachings on the TV or radio, such as theVoice of Islamradio or theIslam channel. There are also online communities you can join, whether that’s for prayer and lessons, or to connect with people during iftar. There can be lots of different reasons why you might struggle with your mental health. You may be going through a big life change or dealing with challenging circumstances, or you may be experiencing a mental health problem, or a physical health problem that’s affecting your wellbeing. Any of these things might affect you during Ramadan. Whatever you’re going through, remember that you’re not alone. It might help to talk to someone at your mosque, like your Imam, or someone leading or participating in a group. It’s important to find someone you trust who you feel you can open-up to. You might want to talk to someone you don’t know, but who can understand your situation. This might be through a helpline, or through a therapist. During Ramadan, there is a focus on developing good habits, which includes kind deeds and helping others. Our research shows that doing good can help you feel good. There is evidence that kindness canreduce stress and improve our emotional wellbeing. Good deeds to do during Ramadan could be: Remember that giving should be within your means and capability. Right now, many people are affected by the high cost-of-living and may not be able to give as much as they have in previous years, and that’s ok. Get more ideas for good deeds through our ‘Random Acts of Kindness’blog. Ramadan is a spiritual month, that involves personal reflection and growth. So, it’s expected that different thoughts and feelings may come up through prayer, learning, and contemplation. To help you recognise and manage your feelings and reflections during Ramadan, it can help to write them down. For example, you might try to write down how different practices make you feel and what you’d like to continue after Ramadan. All you need is a notepad and a pen, or you can take notes on your phone, tablet or computer. You may wish to set your own personal goals during Ramadan. These can help you make the most out of Ramadan and keep you motivated and focused. Try to make sure your goals are realistic and work for you. Remember, Ramadan is not meant to be a burden or unachievable. We’re all different and unique individuals, with different lives and priorities. And while there are many shared practices during Ramadan, it’s ok for Ramadan to look different for different people. Try not to compare yourself to others, whose routines and practices for Ramadan look different than yours. For example, it can be easier for some people to go the mosque more frequently than others. So, while you might want to visit the mosque more frequently, don’t feel bad if you’re not able to. Or, if you’re not able to fast, or need to stop fasting, remember that you will have an opportunity to make up for it later (if you are able to). There are so many opportunities to learn during Ramadan, so it’s good to keep an open-mind and embrace new knowledge and understanding. There are lots of different ways to learn during Ramadan, and you might want to try different ones to find out what works best for you. Some people prefer to listen to lessons, through podcasts or the radio, such as theVoices of Islam. Others may prefer watching lessons on the TV or short videos, such as those on theThe Yaqeen Institute (US)website. Or you might enjoy learning together with others at the mosque. All these different ways to learn are valid. So why not explore different ones, and see what helps you the most? If you have a health problem, remember that there are exceptions and accommodations for observing Ramadan to ensure you stay well. If you’re unsure about how to fast safely, seek help and advicethrough your GP. If you feel comfortable to, you may also want to talk about your concerns with your Imam, or someone else at your mosque or in your community. Read this advice on managing a health condition during Ramadan fromPatient UK. Exceptions and accommodations for Ramadan include for mental health problems. Fasting and other parts of Ramadan can be difficult for people with certain mental health problems. It’s important to talk to a professional about your mental health in the context of Ramadan. They may be able to advise on how you can observe Ramadan while prioritising your health and wellbeing, and help you plan for different scenarios. Find more mental health support on ourget helppage.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/movement/boost-your-mental-health-moving-more,Boost your mental health by moving more,"One of the most important things we can do to help protect our mental health is regular movement. Our bodies and our minds are connected. Looking after ourselves physically also helps us prevent problems with our mental health. Movement is a great way to enhance our wellbeing. Even a short burst of 10 minutes’ brisk walking can boost our mood and increase our mental alertness and energy. Movement helps us feel better about our bodies and improve self-esteem. It can also help reduce stress and anxiety and help us to sleep better. If you’d like to get moving more, this guide will give you some ideas to get started as well as tips on how to get the best mental health benefits from the movement you’re doing. Life gets busy and it can feel like we don’t have time to spend on activities to improve our wellbeing. But, finding moments for movement throughout the day might be easier than you think. How often do you find yourself ‘waiting’ throughout the day? Waiting for the kettle to boil; for your children to come out of school; for a bus to arrive; or for a delivery. These moments can add up. If you use the time to get moving, that will add up too. You could march on the spot, do some stretches, or try some chair exercises. Give it a go! You’ll be surprised how much time you can fill with movement. When you’re beginning to move more for your mental health, set yourself small goals. It might be walking to the end of your street. Then you can push yourself a little further each day. Perhaps keep a movement journal so you can track your progress and how it makes you feel. Your goals are personal to you, and as you make progress you will create positive feelings that can boost your confidence and mood. Many of us are sitting for long periods during the day: working at desks, driving, sitting down to browse the internet or scroll through social media, watching our favourite television show or reading a book. Research shows that it’s unhealthy to be sitting or not moving for long. If you are sitting for large periods of time throughout the day, set a timer to take regular breaks to stand up, walk around and stretch your body. However you choose to get moving, the best option is usually the one we enjoy the most. Do you remember the joy and excitement when the school bell rang for break time?  We couldn’t wait to get outside to run around and play. As we get older, we sometimes forget that movement can be fun!  Instead of thinking of exercise as a chore, embrace your inner child and find the joy in movement. Fun and laughter alongside movement will increase your motivation and the psychological benefits. Play games like tag with family or friends, interrupt extra-long work meetings with a bit of fun movement to give everyone an energy boost, or go for a picnic in the park and a game of rounders. If you have younger children, why not ask them to teach you their playground games and all play together?  You can also teach them the games you used to play that may have fallen out of fashion… is hopscotch still a thing? There are also online games and apps that can get you out and about – try the treasure hunt game Geocaching or maybe Pokemon Go. We can strengthen our personal relationships or even make new friends when we take part in movement activities with other people. These social connections are also great for our mental health and wellbeing. Think about ways you can make your catch-ups with friends more active. Maybe, instead of meeting in a coffee shop, get your coffee to go and take a walk at your comfortable pace. Or visit your local pool and chat while having a swim. You could also use opportunities for movement to meet new people. Check out what groups and activities are taking place in your area and sign up to join in. Being part of a club or team is a great way to increase your self-esteem and help reduce feelings of depression, stress, and anxiety. It can feel nerve-wracking to think about moving more if you’re worried you can’t keep up with other people. Remember, you don’t have to be super sporty to get the mental health benefits that come with more movement. Focus on you and don’t worry about what other people are doing. For your own wellbeing, be kind to yourself and don’t feel pressured to keep up with someone else. Regardless of the form it takes, movement that gets our heart pumping and muscles moving releases the “feel good” hormones that help reduce feelings of stress and anger. If you haven’t exercised in a long time or have reduced mobility, you can start off slowly. Perhaps concentrate the movement on specific parts of the body that you feel more comfortable with. A little can go a long way and the more you do it, the easier it gets and the more active you’ll be. Often, we are moving without realising it. For example, when we do housework, grocery shopping, or walking to work. Try to be mindful of how you're moving, and the way it makes you feel in both your mind and body. Noticing how we’re breathing, the sights and sounds around us, how the air feels on our face, can help us relax and feel less stressed. Practising mindfulness can help with this. For example, you can practise mindful walking. It might feel good to do certain movements faster or slow some of them down. Try to do what feels good. And remember to recognise and celebrate your moments for movement, big and small. Research suggests that doing movement in an outdoor ‘green’ environment has greater positive effects on our wellbeing compared to doing activity indoors. So why not take your moments for movement out in the wild? Go for a walk in the countryside or perhaps try cold water swimming at the beach (make sure to take appropriate safety precautions seeRNLI advice). Even if you live in the city, nature is often close by. Parks, gardens, nature reserves, forests, all provide opportunities for exercise, movement and meeting new people. You could find opportunities to get moving such as a walking group, gardening club, or volunteering for woodland and park maintenance. When we are open to trying new experiences, we reap the rewards to our wellbeing. You might be inspired by watching Strictly Come Dancing but have been too shy to try your local dance classes. Give it a whirl! Pushing ourselves to try new things opens us up to new opportunities for movement, making new friends and having fun. Having the courage to try something new will also give your confidence a boost. If you don’t try, you’ll never know! We know having events and plans in the diary to forward to, is great for mental health, it can give a sense of hope and excitement for the future. Add moments for movement to your diary and make plans to do fun things that you can get excited about. This could be planning a family outing for a walk in an interesting place you haven’t been to before, joining a club or class that you can look forward to every week, or a night out dancing with friends. Some songs are just made for moving. We all have favourite tunes that get us on the dance floor. So, crank them up and have a living room disco where you can dance like no-one’s watching! Why not play your favourite song when you get up in the morning, dance around and put yourself in a good mood for the day ahead? With DJ and presenter Edith Bowman's help, we asked our audiences to share the tracks which help them get moving.Check out our playlist on Spotify. It can be hard to get yourself up and active if your mental health is poor. The days when you lack in motivation or are feeling low are likely when you’ll see the biggest boost to your mood by getting moving. Think of moving more as an act of self-care that will help you to feel good. If you’re struggling to even leave your bed or house, take advantage of the times when you have to get up; for example, to use the bathroom or get something to get something to drink. Use these times to do a bit of movement – some stretches, some lunges, marching on the spot. If you feel anxious about going outside, there are also lots of home workout ideas on YouTube that can help get you moving. Don’t be too hard on yourself if you’re struggling to get moving. Take small steps each day and you’ll soon feel the benefits. Taking time to rest is important for good mental health, especially if you’ve been using up a lot of energy. Try to prioritise time for rest and establish a regular, relaxing routine that lets you unwind and sends a signal to your brain that it's time to rest. Well done! Congratulate yourself for taking care of your body and mind. Make sure to reward yourself too, perhaps a nice bubble bath after a walk in the park or something else that you enjoy. Appreciation is a powerful way of generating positive thoughts and feelings. Recognising our progress is an important part of moving for our mental health!

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/movement/movement-research,Moving more is good for our mental health,"The evidence of the benefits of movement to both physical and mental health is well documented. Our research showed that 82% of people believe that regular physical activity is important for mental health and wellbeing. However, over a third of UK adults do not meet the recommendations set out by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Inour new report, we explore what’s stopping the UK population from being more active, and what could help get people moving more for their mental health. Regular physical activity is proven to improve mental health, quality of life, and wellbeing. It also helps prevent and treat heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and breast and colon cancer, and more. Despite these benefits being well established, physical inactivity continues to be a global health issue. In the UK, 36% of adults (aged 18+) do not meet the physical activity recommendations set out by the World Health Organisation. At the same time, the UK Chief Medical Officer’s physical activity guidelines emphasise that people who are the least active have the most to gain from doing more. Even small increases in physical activity levels can result in a range of physical and mental health benefits:“Any activity is better than none, and more is better still”1. Physical inactivity negatively affects both physical and mental health.  Research has found that people who are inactive have three times the rate of moderate to severe depression of active people. There is also strong evidence to support the role of physical activity in the reduction of symptoms of depression and anxiety.Regular physical activity can reduce your risk of depression by up to 30%.Many other mental health benefits of being active have been identified, including increased self-esteem, reduced stress, and improved quality of life. And yet, over a third of people are not meeting the recommended guidelines. In our research however,when we asked the UK population if they believed that regular physical activity is important for mental health and wellbeing, 82% of UK adults agreed.So why the disconnect? We can all find it difficult to be active from time to time. However, there are also health inequalities related to physical inactivity that can affect someone’s ability to move more, including income, gender, age, ethnicity, and disability. Higher levels of inactivity disproportionately affect certain populations, such as people with long-term health conditions and people living in areas of socio-economic deprivation. Recent research suggests that existing inequalities in inactivity have been further widened by the Covid-19 pandemic, and that this gap is most significant for some people from minority ethnic communities and people from lower socio-economic groups. However, to address inequalities in physical inactivity and support people to move more, it is important to understand the barriers faced by the population in relation to being physically active. Our bodies and our minds are connected, so looking after ourselves physically also helps us prevent problems with our mental health. Exercise releases “feel good” hormones, that reduce feelings of stress and anger. It also helps us feel better about our bodies. It can improve our sleep too. If it involves other people, like being part of a team, a class or group we see regularly, that can also boost our mental health. The mental health and wellbeing benefits of moving more include: In our survey, more than four in five people (82%) agreed that regular physical activity is important for mental health and wellbeing. “You feel just a sense of accomplishment, so that’s why it boosts my mental health.” “I know when I do go out for a walk, I come back feeling a lot better.” Our research showed that the barriers to undertaking physical activity are wide and varied and many people need support. We asked in our survey what would help you become more physically active: It’s clear that – other than better weather (42%) – people need help to find activities they enjoy (31%) that are low cost and local (29%). This was also borne out in the focus groups where people felt that doing an activity they enjoy can transform exercise from a mundane task into a fulfilling and enjoyable experience. Ultimately, there is only so much we can overcome as individuals.  Like most things that are good for our mental health such as eating a healthy diet, staying out of debt, or getting good sleep, it is much easier to be physically active when we feel secure in our homes, have adequate income to cover essential living costs, are not living with a long-term health condition, and are not subject to racism or discrimination. Being able to protect our own mental health should not be a luxury.But too many people are denied the chance to do things that are good for mental health due to poverty, financial strain, and inequality.  It is these root causes that must be addressed if we are to achieve our vision of good mental health for all. The Mental Health Foundation wanted to better understand the views and experiences of people at higher risk of poor mental health in relation to physical activity. So late last year we held focus groups across the UK and spoke to a range of people, including: families and young people affected by poverty and financial strain; people living with long term health conditions; asylum seekers and refugees; and people with lived experience of poor mental health. Next, in March 2024, we conducted an online survey working with Opinium of 6,000 UK adults aged 18+ (weighted to be nationally representative) to help us develop a more detailed understanding of the challenges and barriers to physical activity for people more at risk of poor mental health. This document details our findings. The theme of Mental Health Awareness Week (13-19 May 2024) is Movement: Moving more for our mental health. Home of Mental Health Awareness Week"
https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/movement/moving-your-mental-health-long-term-health-condition,Moving for your mental health with a long-term health condition,"Just living life is a challenge for many people living with chronic long-term health conditions. So adding exercise into the mix can often feel, not just hard, but near impossible. Fatigue, pain, restricted mobility and side effects from meditation can stop people from doing physical activity in their daily lives. Our research shows that almost half of people living with a long-term health condition, or a disability, said it stopped them from doing more physical activity in a typical week. We know that moving our bodies regularly can support good mental health and wellbeing so we hope these stories inspire others to try taking #MomentsforMovement this Mental Health Awareness Week – and beyond. Dave talks about how living with chronic arthritis and other health conditions affects his mental health – and how cold-water therapy and short walks, when he can, help him cope. “It’s good to get the body moving. It’s an achievement. It might not be a big achievement for some people, but it is for me. Simply by being able to do it.” Read Dave's story Christina talks about how living with Type 1 Diabetes, and seven other auto-immune conditions, makes exercise difficult – but how essential it is to support her mental and physical health. “Even though it’s hard sometimes, and I maybe end up hypo (low blood sugars), and occasionally crying in the kitchen eating jelly babies, I think not moving would make things worse, both mentally and physically.” Read Christina's story Photo:Versus Arthritis Home of Mental Health Awareness Week"
https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/articles/what-does-home-mean-you-celebrating-refugee-week-2024,What does home mean to you? Celebrating Refugee Week 2024,"Refugee Week is the world’s largest arts & culture festival celebrating the contributions, creativity and resilience of refugees and people seeking sanctuary. The festival is a partnership project coordinated byCounterpoints Arts. This year’s theme is ‘Our Home’. There are many things that contribute to us feeling at home in a place, such as safety, belonging, and connection. These are things that everyone deserves and are all important to our mental health. As an asylum seeker or refugee, it’s not always easy to feel at home in a new country.  Even if we feel safe and secure, we also need to feel welcome, connected, and a sense of belonging. In line with the Refugee Week theme, we’ve asked the refugees and asylum seekers we work with about what home means to them. Here’s what they said: “Home means security, Home means love, Home means affection, Home means my spouse, Home means children and energy, Home means the exchange of love and kindness, Home means family and its beauty.” ""Home means a lot to me. It’s about being with family and sharing our culture and traditions. It’s attending events, enjoying our own food, and spending time with friends. Home is about missing the familiar climate, the flavors, and the places we long for. It's the nostalgia that takes us back to the past, reminding us of all our relationships with friends and family."" ""Home for me means security and peace, being with family, being with those I love. Home is a place you can back from the everyday tiredness, it means relaxing with a cup of tea on the comfortable sofa, listening to the stories of loved ones. It means being together."" “Home is the place where we live our life, make memories, have a cup of tea when we need to start difficult conversation, Home is place where you can plan what we do next...” “For me, home is a space where my safety, peace and acceptance are guaranteed as a protective entity that shields against both good and bad days, bridging the inner and outside worlds.” “For me home means comfort and somewhere that I feel safe and love” Everyone deserves to feel at home in the place they live. Thank you to our MHF volunteers for sharing what home means to them. Many refugees and asylum seekers are facing exceptionally difficult circumstances in the UK: poverty, financial insecurity, unemployment, lack of adequate housing, social isolation, loneliness, prejudice, stigma, and discrimination. These all put people at higher risk of poor mental health and prevent them from feeling at home in the UK. But there is hope. We can change our systems and processes to better protect the mental health of refugees and asylum seekers. We know we can do better. Find out more aboutwhat we’re calling for. This report presents evidence on the circumstances which asylum seekers and refugees in the UK can face, and how these experiences can harm their mental health and even lead to suicidal feelings and actions.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/my-life-and-wellbeing-asylum-seeker-glasgow-menesias-story,Life and wellbeing as an asylum seeker,"Menesia volunteers with the Mental Health Foundation’s asylum seeker and refugees’ mental health project, ‘Weaving Threads for Wellbeing’ in Scotland. An asylum seeker from Namibia, Menesia has lived in Glasgow since arriving in the UK in 2020 at the height of the Covid pandemic. She first became involved with the Mental Health Foundation through theHealth Issues in the Community (HIIC) course. Menesia then joined the Mental Health Foundation as a volunteer, taking part in a variety of events and projects, including speaking at our Black History Month Summit, and producing the ‘Navigate’ podcast as part of our ‘Weaving Threads for Wellbeing’ project. With a diversely skilled background as a nurse and midwife, radio station manager, UN coordinator, and prison officer, to name only a few of her previous careers, Menesia describes herself as a “jack-of-all-trades”. She is passionate about volunteering and sharing those skills with others, as well as learning new ones. The Mental Health Foundation is one of the lucky organisations to benefit from her skills, passion and determination. Volunteering can be a valuable activity for refugees and asylum seekers, offering the opportunity to learn, make connections, and get the psychological benefits that come with giving. And for organisations, having volunteers with diverse experience as an asylum seeker or refugee can bring huge benefits. Menesia describes her experiences since arriving in Glasgow as mostly positive. She gives a lot of credit to the people of Glasgow, who she describes as “one-of-a-kind”, treating her as “one of their own”, and the city as both “peaceful and loud”. “If you ask for directions in Glasgow, you’ll know if they’re actually from Glasgow because they’ll always help you”. She acknowledges the tough experiences, too. Menesia was staying at the Park Inn Hotel in Glasgow at the time of the tragic incident involving asylum seekers who were housed there. She also spoke about the Kenmure Street Home Office raid, which led to a community protest resulting in the release of the asylum seekers who had been detained. In both these incidents, Menesia remembered the way the people of Glasgow supported them. “The people of Glasgow came together in masses to support them. They reached beyond colour, beyond place of origin - beyond all.” With the current climate of negative portrayals of refugees and asylum seekers and their scapegoating in politics, it can often feel like there’s rarely positive stories. But these positive stories – about camaraderie between us, or success and celebration – are all so important. Seeing the people of Glasgow protest wrongful treatment of asylum seekers and refugees wouldn’t only instil hope in those in Glasgow like Menesia, but refugees and asylum seekers across the UK who may not be feeling welcome. Menesia describes the asylum process as “stressful” and something you cannot go through alone. “Everyone needs help through this. You had a life, people you want to be with, and you miss them”. She encourages people to reach out to organisations for help, as they can help you bridge the gaps. Talking about managing her mental health, she describes it as knowing your strengths and weaknesses. “Sometimes, you need someone”. She sees mental health as very important. “If your mental health isn’t ok, then you’re not ok”. For Menesia, part of how she’s has dealt with the stress of the asylum process has been by learning as much as possible and seizing every opportunity that’s come her way. “There is so much space for you to grow as a person. If I don’t take the opportunity, it’s only myself who loses”. This is how Menesia came to be a volunteer with the Mental Health Foundation across a number of different projects and events. “The Mental Health Foundation recognises your skills and value. They treat you as one of your own, no different than anyone else. I feel like I belong.” Menesia explained about how thenew Navigate podcastcame about. “I learnt all these things myself – getting a bank account, healthcare, working. No-one told us how to do this. So, we created the podcast about these topics (education, banking and finance, volunteering, and work) to be a tool for others, to help them navigate it”. You can listen to all 4 episodes now. Listen now Menesia’s advice to asylum seekers and refugees arriving in the UK is, “reach out to the people of this country.” She explains that the asylum process is hard – so it’s important to reach out. There are lots of organisations who can help, you just need to take that step and ask for it. She also says, “don’t rush, it’s not fast. Be patient.”. A lot of the asylum process involves waiting, and not knowing what’s coming next. For Menesia, the way she coped with this was by taking action and pursuing all the opportunities she could. “Appreciate what you have now, like your safety and your life. Ask for help. And take all the opportunities you get.” For Menesia, being known, valued and understood is really important. “Learn and teach your culture. You’re in a new space to appreciate. So, try to understand it. And also tell people who you are – let them know you.” When asked what’s next for her, Menesia spoke about writing a book to tell her story. And the Mental Health Foundation team can’t wait to read it. Crisis advice and mental health support to help people settle within their new community.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blog/pride-month-and-lgbtqia-mental-health,Pride Month and LGBTQIA+ mental health,"Ashley, Beth, Peter and Mark are part of the LGBTQIA+ community and members ofOur Personal Experience Network (OPEN). In this blog, they share their experiences of Pride Month and what it means to their mental health. Pride Month is about acceptance, equality, and celebrating the work of LGBTQIA+ people – with parades and events all over the world. Pride Month can positively affect people's mental health by bringing LGBTQIA+ people together as a community and inspiring hope for the future, united in the movement for LGBTQIA+ rights and equality. There are many diverse experiences of Pride Month, and we explore some of these experiences and how they intersect with mental health. Pride Month began with the Stonewall uprising of 1969 – protests in response to police raids in gay bars in New York. These events took place in the context of discrimination and persecution against the LGBTQIA+ community. The first UK Pride Rally took place a few years later in London. Every June, Pride Month honours the history of Stonewall, and the activism it sparked that has pushed LGBTQIA+ rights forward. “Pride is a protest and when you see those placards and chants fighting for equality, I feel part of a movement, built on the shoulders of activists.” - Peter  It is also a time of celebration, with spaces for LGBTQIA+ to come together in solidarity, joy and hope. “It’s hugely helpful and empowering in validating recognition of queer lives supported by our allies in the LGBTQIA+ world."" - Ashley. For Mark, “It’s very important that Pride Month continues in the aims of not only being fun but has the serious and powerful message of what Pride is. “It’s a celebration, but also a tribute to those who have gone before. I am 50, but there are many more who worked hard before myself to attain rights for the community to be who they are. So, I continue that tradition but also enjoy the wonderful party and celebration atmosphere.” For Beth, the biggest benefit of Pride Month for the LGBTQIA+ community is “to unite together and remember they are never alone”. When it comes to mental health, both the celebration and activism of Pride Month are important. Discrimination and prejudice against LGBTQIA+ people are far from things of the past, and the fight for LGBTQIA+ rights are ongoing in the UK and across the world. Pride Month continues to be a catalyst for change, playing a vital role in the fight for LGBTQIA+ equality. Ashley describes Pride Month as: “a joyous experience, combating social isolation and sometimes low self-esteem, and an antidote to homophobic and transphobic media and political stances.” Beth says, “It saddens me that people are still homophobic and transphobic, but it helps to see rainbows everywhere.” Peter shares, “I think it can be challenging time for many - as much as we’ve fought for our rights and equality, it’s very quickly weaponised against us. Many LGBTQIA+ people have code switch and dim their light for safety, particularly trans people who continue to face vile attacks from politicians and the media. “I hope that it brings funding and profiling to vital spaces for LGBTQIA+ people. I still think there’s a lot of pinkwashing - turning your brand logo in to a rainbow doesn’t keep us safe. It’s policies, fair pay and challenging homophobia, biphobia and transphobia that’s truly going to liberate us. There’s also the awareness that by creating an inclusive culture you also uplift and empower the majority.” If you’ve been affected by prejudice or discrimination as a member of the LGBTQIA+ community, you’re not alone.Go to the bottom of this pageto find information about where to find help. Pride Month can play a big role in bringing together the LGBTQIA+ community in all its wonderful diversity. Peter shares, “For a lot of people, Pride Month shows us that we have a community and that we’re not navigating the world in isolation. I hope it spotlights the diversity of our community and the grassroots organisations and spaces that allow us to come together. I learnt of a local LGBTQIA+ mental health charity when I first attended Brighton Pride and they really supported me through a rough period.” For Beth, Pride Month “gives the community hope and solidarity for the future.” And for Ashley, “it helps to undo, somewhat at least, pervasive negative media and political output against our community.” Mark says, “for many who are maybe not ‘out’ and struggling with their own sexuality or gender identity, it can be a tough time. We may want to think homophobia, biphobia or transphobia is a thing in our past, but it still is alive and there with people still uneducated and ignorant to the way people think the LGBTQIA+ community is. So, the month helps in a kind of solidarity for those still living in the closet.” Pride Month is first and foremost for the LGBTQIA+ community. But allyship is important, and Pride Month can play a role in this. In Ashley’s experience, “families and allies equally participate empowering us all.” And while Beth explains that some people can be judgmental, she also says: “Often it helps to educate others about the community and what Pride represents.” Being a good ally means: learning about important issues affecting the LGBTQIA+ community; speaking up and calling out discrimination when you can; being there for the people in your life who need support. Find out more about being a LGBTQIA+ ally: read the LGBT Foundation's guide,How to be a good trans ally, or the Stonewall Scotland guide,How to be a good LGBTQ+ ally at work. Everyone’s experience of Pride Month will be different. Pride Month may bring up difficult feelings if you’re not ‘out’, or if you’re struggling with your gender identity or sexuality. You might also be affected by prejudice conversations around Pride Month in the media, on social media, or where you go to school, university, work or socialise. Beth shares, “there are sometimes protestors who want to dampen the spirits of our community - this only shows how much we need Pride month.” Mark says, “It can be triggering in some ways of the times before I was fully out, also the times of abuse. However, it can also make my mental health become resolved and resolute to where we all have been and where we are going. “We are not in that beautiful place of everyone accepting everyone we still have people who would hurt someone because of their identity, or for them just being who they are. I am always mindful of my approach to Pride Month, and I need to have that protection bell in my head to help me if my mental health is declining.” For Peter, “it’s not the concept of Pride Month but the response across social media, the government and the opposition, and columnists that’s hurting us. There seems to be very little accountability or consequences for the transphobia and threats that are incessant. “It’s not the responsibility of trans people to challenge this - I want to see more from charities and corporates that have unwavering support. It’s not a culture war - it’s about equity, dignity and respect.” Finally, we asked Peter, Mark, Beth and Ashley to share the three words they would use to describe Pride Month. What would yours be? ""Empowering, joyous, enriching"". - Ashley ""Fun, inspiring, wholesome."" - Beth ""Remembrance, defiance, community."" - Peter ""History, fun, tenacity."" - Mark Thank you to those who shared their voice and experiences. If you’re part of the LGBTQIA+ community, you may face difficult experiences, like discrimination and stigma, that can affect your mental health. We also know that there are lots of positive experiences with being LGBTQIA+ which can boost your mental health. It may feel helpful to get support from an organisation with a deeper understanding of your experience as an LGBTQIA+ person. This doesn’t mean that other mental health services aren’t for you – as services should always be inclusive and welcoming.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/breastfeeding-and-my-mental-health-lauras-story,Breastfeeding and my mental health: Laura's story,"Location:Northern Ireland Laura, mum of three, shares her experiences with breastfeeding her third child, who was born prematurely. For Laura, breastfeeding has been crucial for her mental health and wellbeing. Laura's story mentions postnatal depression. Please find a link to more information about postnatal depression and ways to get support at the end of this page. In 2015 I was pregnant with my third child. My postnatal depression from number two had been re-designated as an perinatal depression, and some days were more about surviving than thriving. But mostly, we were on an even keel as a family. We had been through the pregnancy journey twice before with both boys arriving late, knew the ups and downs, and were firmly of the opinion that we knew what we were doing. As is so often the case though, we were in for quite the lesson. At 31 weeks I experienced a rupture of my membranes. After a short stay in hospital, I convinced the doctors and midwives to allow me to go home to be with my family. I rested as much as I could with two adventurous boys at home, visited my GP every other day, and attended the maternity clinic every 48 hours. Then at 33 weeks labour began, and after a blue-light ride in an ambulance to a hospital we had never set foot in before, Amy was born. Grey and not breathing, tiny and poorly; our little girl needed a lot of extra help. After a very quick cuddle and some hastily taken photographs, she was whisked away to NICU, and we were left alone. We had plenty of time to worry as we waited. Instead of taking care of her we had to trust others, and nobody could tell us what the next hours, days or weeks would look like. As we worried, we also wondered why. And unsurprisingly, I believed it to be my fault. What had I done differently this time? Was it my depression, why couldn’t I protect my daughter as I had my sons? The feelings of uselessness and guilt were overwhelming. After what felt like a lifetime, we were taken to see our girl in the incubator and to meet with the consultant. Although Amy was not in imminent danger, and her development appeared to be ok for her length of gestation, we were advised that she would need help with breathing, eating and maintaining her temperature, and that she would be on a lot of antibiotics for the infection they couldn’t quite pinpoint. Then the intensive care nurse explained how they would work out her feeds and these would be given through a tube. She then asked if I would like support to express and later breastfeed. This was the first moment when I began to feel like the mother I had been with the boys. Motherhood for me is often about the practicalities, lovingly meeting needs, showing care and providing. All of the things that medical staff were taking care of. To be reminded that I could still do this meant the world to me. I had a purpose; I could give something to my baby. It took time to express sufficient quantities for feeds. But every time I produced even a few millilitres, these were added to Amy’s feeds, and I felt more connected to her and more connected to myself as her mother. As time went on, I was able to borrow a breast pump from a local charity to both build up my supply at home and to provide for Amy’s feeds. I was then supported by the nurses to help Amy learn how to breastfeed properly. The journey wasn’t easy and the feelings of unidentifiable dread that had been a feature throughout my postnatal depression lingered for a long time. I also experienced a lot of self doubt, as life with a premature baby brings its own set of challenges that don’t end when you finally get to bring your baby home. Breastfeeding Amy meant that I had moments where I felt that I was in control, that I was a good enough mummy, providing all that she needed. Sadly, the time spent breastfeeding Amy was shorter than I would have hoped. Amy did not meet the expected weight gains according to the charts from the health visitor, and we soon had to supplement her with prescribed formula. I continue to have mixed feelings about this. While Amy was small to start with, I have never been convinced that formula was the correct choice. Perhaps if the medical team working with us in the community were better trained in both prematurity and breastfeeding we could have found ways to maintain the breastfeeding? With that said, I know that in the early days of being Amy’s mum, being able to breastfeed her gave me that special time with her. I was her mummy, and I could provide what she needed. In times of self-doubt and fear, having these things to hold on to and feeling that I was useful kept me from falling further into depression. We often hear how breast is best for baby. I can say with confidence that for us breast was also best for mummy. Home of Mental Health Awareness Week"

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/exploring-visibility-and-mental-health-through-arts-laurens-story,Exploring visibility and mental health through the arts: Lauren’s story,"Location:Scotland Lauren Stonebanks, a member of theScottish Mental Health Arts Festival’s national planning group, tells us what this year’s festival theme ‘In/Visible’ means to them.  My name is Lauren Stonebanks and I have a superpower. I can turn invisible. No, that's not quite right. I am invisible. No, that's not it either. I am often invisible and at other times far too visible and sometimes for the same reason. I realise that doesn't make much sense so I'll try to explain. I'm Brown. I was assigned female at birth. I'm Non-Binary, Bisexual and Demisexual. I'm Autistic and have ADHD but wasn't diagnosed until my 40s. I have Fibromyalgia and Complex-PTSD. I'm ignored in meetings and conferences when I raise my hand, especially ones where the organisers don't know me. Anything I do get to say is not given any real consideration until someone with more privilege says it. I struggle to be seen and served in pubs and it’s rare that anyone will give me a seat on a bus despite me using a walking stick. They’ll move for a young white woman with a suitcase but not for a 45-year-old Brown person with a shopping trolley. But when I'm sat down at a table in a pub or on a bus minding my own business, I'm suddenly very visible, especially to those who take issue with my skin colour. I’ve been assaulted twice this year so far. I’d make a great designated decoy as I'm the one security guards follow around stores. I'm the one randomly searched at every single Western airport I've ever been through. The gender bias of the diagnostic criteria for autism, ADHD (Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and EUPD (Emotionally unstable personality disorder) meant my autism and ADHD were invisible to medical professionals while the reactive moods, self-harm use, and suicidal ideation made me stand out as someone who might have EUPD. Since getting the ADHD medication, many of my EUPD symptoms improved to the point where my psychiatrist decided I didn’t meet the criteria and Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (C-PTSD) was a more appropriate diagnosis. The EUPD diagnosis made the C-PTSD invisible. I'm the one expected to speak for or represent all the other Brown or Neurodivergent or Queer or Mentally Ill or Disabled people. I’ve never felt like a normal, regular person. I’m almost always hidden or highlighted by one of my many labels. I'm currently an unemployable artist although I still maintain I make a mess that other people mistake for art. I've been involved with various aspects of the Scottish Mental Health Arts Festival since 2012 when my partner and I submitted work to an exhibition run by CAPS Independent Advocacy. After it finished, CAPS asked us to join their planning group for the next one in 2013. We did that along with some other people and that's how theOut of Sight Out of Mind (OOSOOM) exhibitionwas born – it’s now the largest mental health art exhibition in Scotland. After the first exhibition, we were asked if we'd like to come along to the festival planning meetings. I felt daunted at first because in spaces like these I usually feel invisible and like I don’t belong. Feeling like that is my normal partly due to my mental health issues and being neurodivergent but mostly because I'm a minority in almost every situation I've ever been in. I've had so many negative experiences in the past and I never know how people will respond to me. I needn't have worried. Both Kirsten and then Pam at CAPS and Gail at the festival were very welcoming and absolutely lovely, as was everyone else involved. At that point in my life I was still petrified of speaking in front of strangers. My heart would start racing and my hands would shake as my turn to speak neared. Having to introduce myself every time at the exhibition and planning meetings, while terrifying, actually helped build my confidence and bring me out of my shell. It took a while but I began to realise I wasn’t invisible in these spaces. I was treated like an equal even though decades of being ignored left me feeling like I didn’t deserve it. During the selection process for this year's festival theme, everyone in the planning group got to save one from elimination. I don’t remember who first suggested it but I saw ""invisible visible"" on the list and it spoke to me. I asked for it to be saved and explained what that meant to me as someone who is both, and often for exactly the same reason. Invisible and very visible because of my skin colour. Invisible and too visible for neurodivergent and mental health diagnoses. All of which have had a negative effect on my mental health, which is another generally invisible thing. This really seemed to resonate with others and, after more discussion and a minor edit by my partner from Invisible Visible to In/Visible, it ended up being voted as this year's theme! Despite knowing that the Scottish Mental Health Arts Festival is one of the few places where I’m not always invisible and ignored, this left me stunned. This really is a space where someone who feels as inconsequential as me can have an impact and that does wonders for my mental health. The Scottish Mental Health Arts Festival takes place across Scotland from 10-27 October 2024, with over 220 multi-arts events creatively exploring the theme ‘In/Visible’.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/articles/how-understand-and-manage-your-emotions-9-top-tips,How to understand and manage your emotions: 9 top tips,"Location:United Kingdom Managing our emotions is a skill, just like riding a bike. Some people learn to manage their emotions in childhood by watching how their parents or caregivers manage their own difficult emotions. But what happens if our caregivers didn’t have healthy strategies to manage their feelings, or if we didn’t have a consistent person to teach us? If we aren’t taught healthy ways to manage our emotions at home, it can be difficult to know what this looks like or even means. Below, we discuss the importance of understanding and managing your emotions and 9 top tips on how to do so. We all feel intense emotions at times - this is normal. However, if we don’t have healthy ways to manage these emotions, they can start to harm our behaviour and relationships. In the short term, not managing our emotions can increase our risk of anxiety and withdrawal, and lead to difficulties controlling our behaviour. In the long term, we may experience more conflict and relationship breakdowns, and we could be more at risk of depression and other mental health conditions.1 So, it’s important to understand and manage our emotions, so we can feel good in our relationships and within ourselves. It’s never too late to learn how to understand and manage your emotions. Below, we explore 9 ways to control your emotions. Noticing your emotions as you’re feeling them is an important first step to understanding them. From there, you can choose how you want to react. You can start to notice your emotions by checking in with yourself throughout the day. Try writing down how you’re feeling on a piece of paper, on a note on your phone or in a journal. Naming your feelings may sound similar to noticing them, but the act of naming them can help in two main ways2: Naming your feelings could be as simple as saying, “I’m feeling tired and grumpy today, but a little excited for this evening.” You could set yourself the goal of naming your feelings to your spouse, friends or family members once a day. Alternatively, if sharing your emotions with others feels too much right now, you can practice telling yourself in the mirror. When we’re in a situation that triggers intense emotions, we get a physical reaction. This physical reaction can indicate that someone has overstepped our boundaries or that something they said or did reminded us of a painful past experience. One way to identify your triggers is to concentrate on your body. Here are some signs that you may be feeling emotionally triggered: When you notice this physical reaction, it can help to ask yourself: These questions can help you identify what caused you to feel triggered in the present, and what experience it may have reminded you of from the past. Showing yourself compassion can help you understand and regulate your emotions, improve your life satisfaction, and make you feel more connected with the people around you. Self-compassion may also offer you some protection against mental health conditions such asanxietyanddepression.3 You can give yourself compassion in three ways: By processing your difficult feelings and getting them down on paper, you begin to let them go. Studies show that regular journaling helps ease our painful emotions long-term. Journaling consistently for several months is also associated with fewer symptoms of depression.5 If you find it difficult to put your feelings into words, drawing, sculpting and painting are also great ways to get in touch with your feelings. If you didn’t feel safe showing emotions like anger or sadness when you were a child, these emotions may be quickly followed by negative thoughts like: When trying to understand and respond to your emotions, it’s important to do so without criticism or judgement, or by avoiding or dismissing them. When you accept and acknowledge your emotions, the emotions may become less distressing, which can make them easier to manage. You can practice accepting your emotions by imagining that they are leaves on a stream. You can’t stop the leaves from falling, but you can watch them flow downstream, further and further away, until eventually you can’t see them at all. They are temporary, just like your difficult emotions. You can also learn to accept your emotions using positive affirmations. Positive affirmations are phrases you say to yourself to alter negative thinking patterns and acknowledge your difficult feelings. Regularly using positive affirmations candecrease stress, improve our wellbeing, and help us change our behaviour.6 Here are some examples of affirmations you can use: Mindfulnesscan help us understand our emotions and handle them in healthier ways. It can also make distress feel less overwhelming, help us bounce back from difficult emotions quicker, and prevent us from getting stuck in negative thought cycles.7 In terms of our overall mental health, mindfulness may also reduce the symptoms of anxiety and depression.8 For more information on mindfulness, check out our resource: Mindfulness guide It’s not easy learning how to manage your emotions on your own. So, if you’re finding it tough, that’s okay. Many professionals are trained and experienced in helping people just like you with emotion management.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/movement,Moving more for our mental health,"Location:United Kingdom Regular physical activity is known to improve mental health, quality of life, and wellbeing. It also helps prevent and treat heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and breast and colon cancer, and more. Despite these benefits being well established, over a third of UK adults do not meet the recommended amount of activity. In our new report, we explore what’s stopping the UK population from being more active, and what could help get people moving more for their mental health. Read our tips to help you get started moving more to improve your mental health. One of the most important things we can do to help protect our mental health is regular movement. Our bodies and our minds are connected, so looking after ourselves physically also helps us prevent problems with our mental health. Exercise releases “feel good” hormones, that reduce feelings of stress and anger. It also helps us feel better about our bodies. It can improve our sleep too. If it involves other people, like being part of a team, a class or group we see regularly, that can also boost our mental health. Despite these benefits, so many of us struggle to move enough. We know there are many different reasons for this, so this Mental Health Awareness Week we want to help people to find moments for movement in their daily routines. Our Mental Health Awareness Week campaign is not an 'exercise' campaign. Please always consult a healthcare or fitness professional if embarking on a new fitness regime. While moving our bodies regularly is important for our mental health, we know that for people with experience ofeating disordersor exercise addiction, this message might be triggering. Our goal with the campaign is to help people find moments for movement to support good mental health and emotional calm. If you are worried that you or someone you care about is exercising excessively or causing harm, pleasevisit BEAT for further information and support. It's important to find the movement that’s right for you. These people share their experiences of the impact of moving on their mental health.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/articles/postcards-community-using-art-express-what-community-means-us,Postcards of community: using art to express what community means to us,"Location:United Kingdom To create these works, members of our Refugee Programme came together in Glasgow, in the beautiful setting of the Glasgow Museum of Modern Art, to think about the theme of ‘community’ and express what it means to us. To celebrate Mental Health Awareness Week, we asked for their take on community, and to express it in a visual form. Led by Sarmed, a visual artist and filmmaker based in Scotland, the theme was explored in depth; where is community found, what can communities achieve, is community about place, person, or even the natural world around us? Below, the creators explain their postcards in their own words. As you look at your postcards, we hope their creator’s words shines through. Send them onwards to spread the word or keep them for yourself. However you use them, thank you for being a part of this community. ‘Those who plant trees never enjoy their shade’ My postcard shows that community is evident in pride and shared traditions and values. The sun that rises behind the tree is the new opportunity that comes with every new day. The sense of belonging helps them stand firm in times of ridicule and trouble. It shows how being part of a community provides comfort and resilience, making it easier to handle challenges. By standing together can affect decisions made by politicians and change the course of the future. It’s about how communities adapt and grow together, holding on to their shared traditions while figuring out how to face new challenges as a group, showing the power of being united. My drawing represents the theme of community through a vibrant tree with multicoloured branches growing atop a globe. The tree symbolises life, growth, and interconnectedness, while the diverse colours of its branches represent the unity of people from different backgrounds, cultures, and perspectives. Placing the tree on the globe signifies that our strength as a global community lies in embracing diversity and working together harmoniously. The clear blue sky conveys hope and positivity, while the text 'Our unity is our strength' reinforces the idea that collective effort and solidarity are essential for thriving as one world. My family is the most valuable thing for me, so I made this card with love. I have my mum, I have 5 kids, I'm a wife. I look after my family. They are my treasure. Family and home mean peace for me. They are my community. Community, for me, is the freedom to be unapologetically myself—a space where my quirks and background are not just accepted, but truly celebrated. My postcard, painted in a hopeful yellow, features two branches: one vibrant, one worn, both embraced as part of nature’s cycle. This imagery reflects the sense of belonging I found in Glasgow, where diversity is welcomed and every story matters. The phrase “you are free to be you” sits at the heart of my art, inspired by the acceptance I’ve experienced. I hope my card brings a sense of peace and reminds others that community flourishes when we cherish each other, imperfections and all. In this space, I have found the freedom to express myself, and I wish for others to feel the same warmth and acceptance—a place where everyone is nourished and allowed to flourish, just as nature thrives in its diversity. ""Connect, Attune and be healthy""  Nature is loving to ALL. Nature is non judgemental. Nature embraces every living creature. Nature is good for you. Nature is my community. The postcard design features joined hands of people from diverse cultures and communities around the world, all adorned with same styles of body art. It highlights the unifying power of henna, celebrating how this shared tradition connects different communities and transforms diversity into something beautiful and meaningful. ‘Connected with people who are around the city' This represents the strength and beauty of mental health communities. Interconnected people who are around the city symbolise support, growth, and resilience. The design aims to break stigmas surrounding mental health, promoting a sense of belonging and understanding. By sharing this visual representation, I hope to inspire conversations, foster empathy, and encourage individuals to reach out for support. Together, we can cultivate a supportive community where everyone feels seen, heard, and valued. Let's nurture a culture of compassion and understanding, one connection at a time. For flowers to grow, you need the sun, the water, the air, and the soil. For a beautiful, strong flower to thrive and blossom, it needs someone to look after it. It's like in a community; if you work together, what you're working on will grow beautifully and strong, and it'll be something that you are proud of. When I was living in Wigan, the community would come out every year and plant bulbs in the ground so that we could have blossom in summer. When summer came, we had nice flowers blossoming all over our local park. It involved all the community to make our park beautiful. And that's what community is for me. Community is vital for good wellbeing and mental health. Through our refugee programme we are making sure that people have access to a safe and supportive community to call their own. We know refugees and asylum seekers face unique challenges related to their mental health and are often at greater risk of developing mental health problems. Thank you for supporting our work.

With round-the-clock access and endless choice, it’s no wonder many of us find our communities online. From gaming chat rooms to knitting tips, a safe space to vent to a place for debate – online communities have a lot to offer. No matter where you live, the online world can help you meet others who share your interests, aspects of your identity, or similar experiences – helping us feel connected. A positive community should make you feel safe and good about yourself. But not all communities are good for our mental health. It’s important to recognise when a community is doing more harm than good, for example, if it makes you feel uncomfortable, unsafe, or think badly about yourself. Read our tips, created with theMHF Young Leaders,on how to navigate online communities safely. There are lots of different online communities out there, depending on what you’re looking for. Some of us are more comfortable with opening up about our mental health on online communities. We might be less worried about judgment when we can share our feelings anonymously. If you’re struggling, mental health forums can be a helpful space, such as Mind’s online peer support community,Side by Side. If you’re struggling with something that’s affecting your mental health, such as a long-term condition, difficult relationships, alcohol issues, or debt problems, you might want to connect with people with similar experiences who can understand. For example, if you have a long-term condition like diabetes, you might find it helpful to join a platform like theDiabetes UK forum. There are also Facebook groups that offer online peer support. As well as community, there are other proven ways to boost our mental health, such as regular movement and spending time in nature. Many of us use online communities to connect with others with shared interests, or to help us get into something new. From finding a running club on Strava, to joining a WhatsApp group for bird-watching – we can use online communities to help us do more of the things that support our mental health. There are many ways we can find online communities that help our mental health and wellbeing. What’s important is to recognise whether an online community is helping, or harming, your mental health. We go into this more below. Online communities are very popular, because they offer so many benefits. Here are some of the benefits the MHF Young Leaders shared with us: While being part of a positive community can support our mental health, not all communities are good for us.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/articles/how-replace-negative-thought-patterns-curiosity-and-open-mindedness,How to replace negative thought patterns with curiosity and open-mindedness,"Location:United Kingdom It’s natural to have negative thoughts sometimes. But if you get stuck in a pattern of negative thinking, it can harm your mental health and self-esteem. Your thoughts, feelings and behaviours are connected, so how you think also affects how you feel and behave.1That’s why learning how to think in healthier ways can make a big difference to your overall wellbeing. Changing thought patterns begins with being open-minded about the things you previously assumed to be true about yourself. Practicing curiosity can help us re-imagine how we see ourselves, and the world, and open us up to new opportunities, challenges, and perspectives. Thought patterns are the thoughts we repeatedly have about ourselves, others and the world.2When we become stuck in a cycle of negative thought patterns, it can affect how we feel and behave.1 Negative thought patterns can mean: These negative thought patterns can lead to unhealthy behaviours, such as: The way we think, feel and behave is mostly automatic.  We don’t always know what we’re thinking or feeling, or why we behave in certain ways. When something happens, our reactions often are shaped by things that have happened to us in the past, without consciously thinking about it. This tends to begin during childhood. If we grew up with high levels of stress, criticism or neglect, we may have learnt to act in protective ways. These are coping mechanisms that helped us survive pain or harm.3 We continue to use these coping mechanisms when we face similar situations later in life. But over time, we can get stuck in these unhealthy thought and behaviour patterns because they feel safe or familiar. Even if they’re unhelpful, our brains repeat what protected us from discomfort or danger in the past.3 For example, if we were often criticised, we might think we’re not good at things. That thought may stop us from applying for a new job, because we don’t think we could cope with it. If something doesn’t go well, it confirms our belief and strengthens the negative thoughts and behaviour. Negative thoughts and self-talk can have an effect on our mental health and self-esteem: With the right tools and support, we can learn to change negative thought patterns and behaviours. To get started, here are some tips on how to break the cycle of negative thoughts and behaviours. What we think is not always based on reality. Our experiences andemotionscan lead us to make untrue or unrealistic conclusions about ourselves, others and the world.6 Learning to recognise these “cognitive distortions” can help us avoid slipping back into these patterns.3Some examples of cognitive distortions include: Mindfulness can help us to be more aware of our thoughts without judging or reacting to them.8We learn to accept them as they are and then let them go. It can be tricky at first, but the more we do it the easier it becomes. To learn more about mindfulness, you can check out our resource, “How to look after your mental health using mindfulness.” Our thinking patterns do not make us a bad person. They’re just habits that can be unlearned. So, instead of judging them or ourselves, it’s important to be curious about our thoughts.9Stay open to different perspectives rather than jumping to conclusions. We can ask ourselves: When we’re curious and aware of our negative thoughts, we can replace them with more helpful ones. It takes a bit of practice but with time, it gets easier. For example, instead of thinking, “I’m useless”, we can think of the things we’re good at, no matter how small. Alternatively, we could change an, “I can’t do it” thought to “I can try” or try repeating positive statements about ourselves, such as “I am enough” or “I choose to pay attention to the positives.” It can help to write them down on a piece of paper and stick them somewhere we will see them often. Trying new things and being curious about our world can help us to have more positive thoughts about ourselves. Moments for curiosity and trying new things can be found every day. Take a different route walking the dog, or make a new recipe for dinner. Even small things like these can make life feel more exciting, rewarding, and lively. Is there anything you’ve wanted to do or try, but you’ve been put off by feeling like you can’t do it? Everyone likes different things but here are some ideas: Blaming or criticising ourselves for negative thoughts and behaviours can make us feel worse.10Instead, we can try to speak to ourselves like we would to someone we love and appreciate. We can be a coach to ourselves rather than a critic by asking ourselves: “What’s something comforting I can concentrate on?”Celebrate yourself and all the things you’ve done, big or small. You could try writing down what you like about yourself, your achievements and the compliments people have given you. When we do things that are good for us, we have more energy and feel better about ourselves. This can make it easier to accept and replace negative thinking and behaviour patterns. You can try ourtips for looking after your mental health. If you’re struggling with negative thought patterns and behaviours, it’s okay to ask for help.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/articles/burnout-signs-causes-and-ways-recover,"Burnout: signs, causes and ways to recover","Location:United Kingdom Burnout is a term used to describe a state of physical, mental and emotional exhaustion, often related to workplace stress. While it’s not classified as a mental health condition, it’s closely linked to our mental health. The World Health Organization (WHO) describes it as an “occupational phenomenon” that typically arises from chronic workplace stress that hasn’t been successfully managed. However, personal factors can also increase our risk of burnout. This blog will mostly focus on burnout related to the workplace and how to manage it effectively. When we experience long-term stress and constant pressure, we can reach a point of physical, mental and emotional exhaustion. This state of burnout typically involves:1 Burnout doesn’t tend to get better on its own. If left unmanaged, it can worsen and increase your risk of long-term health issues, such as heart disease and depression.2,3It can also affect your personal relationships and overall wellbeing. But the good news is that recovery is possible. With the right strategies and support, you can manage burnout and begin to feel like yourself again. According to recent reports, it’s estimated that 65% of UK workers feel burnt out.4This is 11% higher than two years earlier, showing it’s becoming increasingly common. What’s more, one in five workers have needed time off due to mental health problems associated with stress at work.5 Let’s compare these numbers to common mental health conditions, such as anxiety and depression. In the UK, one in five adults have a mental health condition.6In 2021, the UK's Health and Safety Executive also reported that stress, alongside anxiety and depression, has become a leading cause of sickness in the UK workforce.7So, burnout is a big problem that links to many mental health challenges in the workplace. But why is it becoming more common? Several factors can contribute, including:  Workplace burnout, also known as job burnout and occupational burnout, is a form of severe stress related to your job. Job burnout happens when work stress becomes chronic. The parts of the brain that deal with the stress response (the amygdala and hippocampus) can become so impaired that the stress response doesn’t turn off.8 Living in a state of permanent stress and on high alert, eventually the body runs out of fuel to keep going. Then comes low energy and ongoing physical and mental exhaustion, all of which can negatively influence your life and wellbeing.  Workplace burnout can also affect how you show up at work. You may feel less satisfied with your role, need to take frequent time off or continue working even when you’re feeling unwell or mentally drained. Your productivity levels are also likely to reduce. If you’re feeling overwhelmed or emotionally drained, or you’re not feeling or acting like your usual self, you might be experiencing burnout. Common signs of burnout include:5,9 It’s important to note that you do not need to have every symptom listed above to experience burnout - just a few may indicate the level of exhaustion associated with burnout. Burnout doesn’t have one single cause. While it’s most commonly linked to chronic stress at work, it can also be influenced by factors outside of the workplace, such as personal factors. We are all different, and things that trigger stress in one person may not in another. Let’s take a look at the leading factors that increase your risk of burnout.11 Certain circumstances at work can bring about burnout, including:  There are some personal factors that can increase your risk of burnout. These may include:5  While burnout can leave you feeling helpless, know that there are things you can do to help yourself recover.  When learning how to deal with burnout, it’s important to recognise the things within your control and those that you have no control over. For example, you may not be in a position to leave your job, but you may be able to raise work issues with the Human Resources (HR) or Occupational Health (OH) team. Some additional strategies to manage burnout include:10   When you understand what is happening with your mental health, you can take positive action to improve your wellbeing. These strategies can all make a difference in helping you recover.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/articles/overwhelm-when-global-events-and-relentless-bad-news-become-too-much,When global events and relentless bad news become too much,"Constantly hearing about negative news from around the world can feel like a lot to take in – and that’s because it is. Feeling overwhelmed by current events, no matter how big or small, can take a toll on our mental health. In the digital age, managing how much information we take on board might feel impossible. But you can take control and limit the impact of global overwhelm on your well-being. Download our free tipsheet Sometimes, it can feel like the world is constantly in crisis. We’ve lived through a pandemic, a climate crisis and times of social injustice. Between these issues and global conflicts, economic instability and political unrest, bad news may seem like it's everywhere. Plus, thanks to smartphones and social media, we have round-the-clock access to the latest news. Staying informed about what’s happening in the world can be a good thing. However, having 24/7 access to current events means there’s potentially no limit to how much we consume. If you’ve found yourself doomscrolling late at night, feeling helpless or wondering whether you should stop reading the news for the sake of your mental health, you’re not alone. Being continually exposed to the news can cause a sense of overwhelm, taking a toll on our mental health and leaving us feeling emotionally drained, anxious, helpless, guilty and scared. But the good news is that by looking after your mental health, you can manage this overwhelm. Feeling overwhelmed isn’t just an emotional response to continual stress – it can also be a physical and mental process. Being exposed to a threat triggers the stress response (fight, flight, freeze mode), which can be useful in situations that require us to take action to ensure our safety. However, when the stress response is triggered long-term, it can have serious impacts on our health. For example, after relentless bad news, you might notice the following changes in yourself:1 Chronic stress builds up slowly, which is why you may not see these signs straight away. You may even feel like you should push through them, but recognising what is happening is important – you are having human reactions to an increasingly unstable world. Being constantly exposed to distressing news can take an emotional toll, even if we’re not directly involved with the events we see. In fact, constant exposure can chip away at our mental health over time, leaving us feeling sad and anxious.2, 3 We may also find ourselves doing, thinking or feeling things that actually make it harder for us to cope. For example, you might: Doomscrolling means spending a long time scrolling through negative news that can make you feel sad, anxious or angry.4We usually doomscroll late at night or when we feel stressed. It may feel like we’re trying to keep up-to-date with what’s happening in the world, but it can instead leave us trapped in an anxious state.5 The conflicts and suffering that people face around the globe can leave you feeling powerless. And when you don’t know what to do about it, you can feel overwhelmed and helpless. Studies have shown that daily exposure to distressing news can contribute to hopelessness.6You may think that things will never improve or that your actions don’t matter in the grand scheme of things, leaving you feeling low. Sometimes, taking a break from the constant stream of news is good for overall well-being. Yet, you might also feel guilty for turning away from global events – like doing so is an act of not caring. Read our tips for managing 'doomscrolling' When things feel ‘too much,’ it’s important to know how to protect your mental health. Below are some tips to help you cope with global news overwhelm and find your way back to balance. Ask yourself how much news content you’re happy to take in, and how often. It’s okay to take a break from the news, and doing so can be beneficial. For example, you could consider checking the news only a couple of times a day, turning off news notifications on your phone or unfollowing social media accounts that bring you anxiety. It can also be helpful to avoid checking the news right before bed – this is your time to unwind and relax for a good night's sleep. When global issues are too much to handle, grounding yourself in the here and now can ease your stress response. You could try practising mindfulness, using a grounding exercise, or going for a walk in nature to help bring you back to the present moment. If you often find yourself doomscrolling, having set phone-free times or zones could help break this habit. For instance, you could try turning off notifications or switching your phone to aeroplane mode at certain times of the day. Or, try keeping certain areas phone-free zones, such as the bedroom or the dining table. Allow yourself some time that’s not going to be interrupted by the ‘ping’ of yet another notification. Although what’s happening in the world can feel very overwhelming, small actions still matter. Whether it’s signing a petition, volunteering with a local cause or donating items, taking positive action can help shift feelings out of helplessness and into purposefulness. Rest isn’t something you need to earn – it’s essential for wellbeing. Taking time to look after yourself doesn’t mean you’ve stopped caring about anything else; it means that you are looking after yourself so that you can keep on caring.

However, it’s easy to end up doomscrolling – constantly scrolling through negative news for long periods of time.1 Doomscrolling is a natural and human response to a world that can feel unstable. However, it can also affect our mental health. While online content can help us feel more informed, reassured and in control, doomscrolling can cause us to become more anxious, sad, or overwhelmed.2 Understanding why we doomscroll and the effect it can have on our wellbeing allows us to create positive changes in managing our mental health. Doomscrolling often begins with good intentions: wanting to learn more about a topic so that we can understand it and feel prepared. This makes sense when we think about it in terms of human survival. Our brains are naturally wired to be on the lookout for threats so we can prepare ourselves for whatever comes our way. We may also doomscroll because we want to feel in control, stay connected with what’s happening in the world, or because we don’t want to miss out on anything important. However, with round-the-clock news updates available with a single tap on a phone screen, it’s easy to get drawn in to reading negative story after story. So what starts out as information gathering can quickly turn into an unconscious habit that can leave us feeling overwhelmed and anxious. Feeling overwhelmed by doomscrolling isn’t uncommon. An overload of negative information can cause us to worry more, feel irritable, have difficulty concentrating, feel guilty and find it hard to “switch off” mentally.5 In fact, doomscrolling can fuel a negative cycle of feeling low or worried, triggering us to continue scrolling content in attempts to feel better, often causing us to end up feeling worse. But the impact of doomscrolling on mental health isn’t just emotional; it can be physical too.For example, doomscrolling can result in physical issues such as headaches, nausea, neck and shoulder pain or even difficulty sleeping.3,4 This may be because doomscrolling triggers our ‘fight, flight, freeze’ response, causing raised blood pressure and increased stress hormones. Even keeping our bodies in an ongoing fixed posture when scrolling can contribute to this effect. Download our free tipsheet Doomscrolling can be so automatic that you may not even realise you are doing it. Here are some of the most common signs that doomscrolling may be negatively affecting your mental health: ●    feeling anxious, tense, or low after checking the news●    scrolling for much longer than you meant to●    checking for news updates multiple times an hour●    feeling emotionally drained or ‘numb’ after your scrolling sessions●    struggling to ‘switch off’ from the outside world. It’s important to know that these are natural responses to constant exposure to distressing news. If you resonate with any of these, know that you’re not alone. We share some tips below for managing doomscrolling that you may find helpful. If you’re looking for ways to spend less time doomscrolling, try these tips: Turn off push notificationsTurning off instant alerts for social media or news apps can give you a break from anxiety-provoking information. This is easy to do; simply go to your phone settings and choose which apps you want to get alerts from and which ones you don’t. Use a watch or an alarm clockIf you often doomscroll in bed, it may be because your phone doubles as your alarm clock. Switching to using a watch or a physical alarm clock may help. This way, you can leave your phone in a different room and break the habit of absorbing negative information that could affect your sleep. Manage your social media feedsYour social media feed is like having a personalised newspaper – you get to decide what content you see. You could make changes to what appears on your feed by blocking or hiding certain profiles, allowing you to limit the negative content you are exposed to. Set a time limitSetting a time limit on your scrolling can help, as long as you stick to it. For instance, you could try setting an alarm to restrict time spent on news apps. Or, try limiting your scrolling to the time it takes to make a cup of tea. Find something that gives you a gentle signal that it’s time to put the phone down. Consider phone-free zonesIf you find yourself regularly doomscrolling in certain places, creating a ‘no-phone zone’ may help you reduce your time spent online. For example, if you use the phone at mealtimes or in bed, you could consider making the bedroom or dining area a phone-free zone. You’re allowed to have quality time that isn’t interrupted by notifications every few minutes. Balance the negative with a positiveFor every doomscrolling session you have, you could choose to balance it out by doing something positive for your emotional health. Mindfulness, reading, spending time with others, and exercising are all great self-care activities that can benefit your wellbeing.6 Download our free tipsheet Doomscrolling can become a habit without you even realising it, but you can take back control. Doing so doesn't mean you don’t care about the world anymore – it means you recognise that taking care of your mental health is important.

https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/perthyn-responding-covid-19,Responding to COVID-19: a process evaluation of Perthyn,"The UK received 29,456 asylum applications in 2020 (Government, 2020a). Each of these represents an individual life and with that life, like ours, comes a story and a journey. The stories of people’s lives are fascinating, sometimes harrowing, sometimes very sad and sometimes jubilant and triumphant. Rarely do we harness these stories towards encouraging others and if we do, we look at the impact on others rather than the storyteller themselves. The aim of this evaluation was to experientially examine the process of people seeking sanctuary becoming peer leaders through the lens of their story using a ‘hope’ theory (Burns, 2020). The evidence suggests that validating and utilising the lived experience of a person seeking sanctuary brings hope to others, how building effective rapport is vital, how ‘peer-ness’ can be a tool in keeping individuals strong and finally how a modelled training approach (MTA) works.
