Brexit: a topic that has overwhelmed, fascinated and exhausted people living in the UK more than anything else in recent memory. I’m not sure if I agree with those calling it a Marmite issue. While Brexit can certainly be divisive, it has much more important and far reaching social and economic implications than whether you love or hate a yeast extract spread. Regardless of where we stand on the issue, we know one thing for certain: it’s stressing us out. The survey we ran in March 2019 (close to the first Brexit deadline) revealed that: Our survey also showed that we share these feelingswhether we voted Leave or Remain. We are either exhausted by a mission to overturn the outcome, or demoralised by the delay in fulfilling the promise of the referendum. We have argued with our family, friends and colleagues. We have lost sleep over it. We have engaged in endless political conversations and changed two Prime Ministers over it. We also know that our children are more anxious. They are actively avoiding social activities or having nightmares because ofscary world news. Examples worldwide show us that an unstable political environment can increaseanxietylevels. Research also shows that experiences of conflict in relationships, problems with sleeping and feelings of powerlessness are all associated withhigher levels of distress and poor well-being. We asked our supporters and followers on social media how they felt about Brexit and mental health. Some told us that they are too overwhelmed by their own issues to deal with Brexit. Others have questioned why we want to talk about it when there are so many other important topics. But then others have criticised us for not talking enough about Brexit when it’s consuming the nation’s media and exhausting the nation’s patience. Both views are valid. Now, almost six months on from our last survey, we are again at a crossroads with a new Brexit deadline fast approaching in October. Many of you said you are afraid of what Brexit means for you and your circumstances and that you are struggling to cope as a result. Others were anxious of the rise in levels of polarisation, intolerance and negativity. Someone told me: “I feel frightened of the angry world outside my door”. Regardless of where we stand on Brexit, it shouldn’t be acceptable for any of us to feel like that. As with everything in mental health, we shouldn’t expect Brexit anxiety to affect everyone equally. People who are disproportionately affected include: Some solutions have emerged. We know thatBrexit is likely to impact heavily on farmersand their families. To propose what would work best for them in this time of uncertainty, we are working on research in collaboration with Public Health Wales. A lot of organisations like us are out there - working hard to help reduce the mental health impacts of Brexit. It seems like everyone has been developing their own ways to deal with the 24-hour news cycle. Some of you told me that these varied from ignoring the topic to signing petitions. And from talking to friends togetting better sleep. On the back of this, we have released newtop tips on dealing with Brexit anxiety. We are extremely grateful to our supporters for providing quotes for this guide. Staying informed may be important, but we should also try to notice our limits. Being able to engage with our communities (live or online) in a meaningful way will also be important in the coming months, as will being able to have honestconversations with our children about UK and world news. Brexit talk and anxiety are here to stay. At the Foundation, we will continue to work towards good mental health for all. But for many of us, empowering our voice through community involvement and staying close to friends may be our only possible contribution. And we shouldn’t underestimate just how important this contribution is. If you feel affected by the content you have read, please see ourget helppage for support. Political uncertainty can negatively affect to our mental health. These tips can help to minimise the impact that events have on how we feel. Millions of people in the UK have felt powerless, angry or worried over the last year because of Brexit, according to calculations from our new poll. News is everywhere. In the digital age, it is no longer possible to control the news that we are exposed to, or to shield children from upsetting information. Anxiety is a feeling of unease, worry or fear. We all feel anxious sometimes, but anxiety may be a mental health problem if your feelings are very strong or last long. 7th May 2025

I was thrilled to join the Mental Health Foundation earlier this year, having worked in health policy all my life. Many of us have struggled with our mental health in recent years, and it feels like there’s never been a more important time to support and protect our mental well-being. The Mental Health Foundation’s approach – preventing mental health problems before they happen and supporting everyone to thrive – really resonates with me. And the icing on the cake is being part ofMental Health Awareness Week! I have joined in with Mental Health Awareness Week for many years and am delighted to now be part of making it happen. This year for Mental Health Awareness Week we are focusing on anxiety. We all feel anxious from time to time. Anxiety is a natural response to the uncertain world around us. For example, in the currentcost-of-living crisis, more than a third ofadults feel anxious about their financial situation. But it’s important that we recognise and respond when we feel anxious, so that our anxiety doesn’t become overwhelming. Anxietycan affect us physically and mentally. If you are feeling anxious, you might notice your heart rate increasing, headaches, loss of appetite, breathlessness or chest pain. (If you are experiencing these symptoms, you should see a healthcare professional to rule out another physical cause). Anxiety might make you feel tense or nervous, find it hard to relax, feel tearful or have problems sleeping and concentrating. Friends or family might notice you are more irritable than usual, or more withdrawn. Or perhaps you seem fine on the outside but feel panicky inside. Help is at hand. There are things that we can all do to protect our mental health and manage anxiety. What works will be different from person to person. Things that might be helpful include being active, getting out in nature, practising breathing techniques, getting support to tackle money worries or eating well. Talking to a friend, or spending time with loved ones, is often a good first step. We’ve looked at the evidence for what works to manage anxiety and brought together ourtop recommendations. Taking action to address specific causes of anxiety can also help – for example, contacting a money advisor, discussing workplace stress with your employer, or seeking support if you are experiencing bullying, harassment or discrimination. If anxiety is severely affecting your everyday life, you shouldcontact your GPwho can offer additional support and help. No one should struggle alone. Anxiety isn’t just something we can overcome on our own. So much of what may trigger anxiety is not within our control. This is why,during Mental Health Awareness Week, we’ll also be talking to politicians and decision-makers about what can be done as a nation to support good mental health. While causes of anxiety are complex, financial worries, social isolation, social pressures and discrimination can all play a part. And because of this, local and national politicians should be looking at measures such as income support to reduce financial stress, provision of good quality housing, strong legislation to prevent bullying, harassment and discrimination, and ensuring communities are equipped with the services and facilities we need to live well and help protect everyone’s mental health.

3,https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/blogs/financial-distress-and-anxiety-during-holidays,Financial distress and anxiety during the holidays,"Location:England No matter what we feel is important at this time of year, it’s hard to escape the feeling that the holidays often means spending more money than we usually would. Whether it's gifts, travel or social events, it can be tough to get through December if your finances are tight, particularly for those of us with children with their own expectations. For some of us, the challenge of balancing your finances with the holidays can be stressful or cause anxiety. This can worsen the stresses that some of us feel every day about our bills. And it can feel like everywhere we look, there’s a reminder or an expectation to spend. But it doesn’t have to feel this way – you can still enjoy the holidays without dwelling on these sorts of feelings. Budgeting is helpful all year round and can give us a real sense of control over our finances. It’s almost always the first step financial experts recommend if we’re stressed over our finances. Budgeting is especially useful at Christmas, when there might be extra costs we don’t know whether we can afford. Having a realistic idea about upcoming income and outgoings over the festive season can also help to get a perspective on our finances, and help us plan what we can afford to spend. Try writing everything down to get a true picture of where you are with things. It’ll be better than trying to remember everything, and it’s helpful to see it all organised on paper. There’ssome great advice from organisations like Citizens Adviceabout how to fill out a budget. Essentially it comes down to totting up your income, then subtracting all essential costs for the month, such as bills, debts to pay and groceries, and finally looking at what’s left over to spend on other things, such as presents. You could also try using a budgeting app to help get a better idea of your finances. There are lots of these available for free from your app provider. Just search for 'budgeting apps'. We often think of gifts as expensive things we buy from shops to give to one another. But that’s not the only way we can make our loved ones feel appreciated this Christmas. If your budget doesn’t allow for big spending, why not consider gifting someone your time or an experience you could share? For example, you might promise to walk their dog once a month, give them a ‘voucher’ for a couple of hours of babysitting, or take on the morning cup of tea making duties for your partner. Or if there’s something you know they love doing, why not try to organise something? You might give your teen a movie night at home with them, watching their favourite film together with some snacks, or arrange to have your friend around for a board game evening you host. If you’ve got a special skill – maybe you play guitar, or you know your way around a yoga mat – you can gift someone your time to help them learn. You could even spread the love – how about promising to try to tick off as many of our50 random acts of kindnessas you can alongside a loved one? Spending time with loved ones is an important part of the festive season, and it can be beneficial for our mental health too. So, you might even find these sorts of presents help you both feel better than traditional gifts. Food for special occasions can be expensive, particularly if you’re hosting for everyone. It can be a real cause of anxiety and stress just pulling everything together – but when we’re anxious about money, that worry is doubled. That doesn’t mean you have to miss out on a special time sat around a table with everyone. Firstly, just because it’s the holidays doesn’t mean you have to shop in more expensive places than you’d usually do. If you use a cheaper supermarket, they might have some great deals on holiday food. Shop around – you might find that different supermarkets have deals on different things. It can also be cheaper to buy your Christmas food early, if you have the freezer space to keep it to the day. There are also some great guides online to cooking for Christmas on a budget,like this one from BBC Good Food. Sometimes all it takes is a bit of creativity – and who knows, you might find a new favourite dish! If you’re hosting for people, ask everyone to bring a dish along. This can reduce the financial burden (as well as the stresses of cooking) you might be taking on. If you want to make it part of the celebrations, you could help your friends and family prepare their dishes in the run up to your dinner. Finally, if things are really difficult for you, and you’re struggling to afford even the essentials, the Trussell Trust are here to help. They canhelp you find your local foodbankorprovide advice via their helpline. At this time of year, you might even find your local foodbank has some Christmas items they can help you with.  It’s important to remember when you’re experiencing financial anxiety that you’re not alone in this. The past few years have been tough for lots of us, and money worries have become more common. But this also means that people are becoming more understanding of when things are a struggle for us financially – which is why it’s so important that, when we feel able to, we’re open and honest about the financial situations we’re in. For example, if you and a friend usually exchange gifts, but you don’t think you can afford it this year and are worried what they’ll think, talk to them about it. A friend wouldn’t want you to be spending money you can’t afford, and they definitely won’t want you to be worrying about them. And who knows – maybe your friend is struggling too, and taking the pressure off them as well is the best gift you can give. It can be particularly difficult to have these conversations with children. They might not understand the financial situation your household is in, or you might be worried about them becoming anxious about the family finances. There are somehelpful guides out there from organisations like StepChangeabout how to have these conversations. And if your situation is taking its toll on your mental health, remember that support is out there. Talk to someone you trust, whether that’s a friend, relative, or someone supporting you with your mental health. Your GP can provide you with more support and theSamaritansare open 24/7 365 days a year. Find tips and advice on looking after your mental health during the festive season.

4,https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/a-z-topics/anxiety,Anxiety,"This content discusses anxiety, panic attacks, loneliness or isolation, trauma and substance abuse or addiction (which may include mentions of alcohol or drug use), which some people may find triggering. It’s normal to feel anxious sometimes. It’s how we respond to feeling threatened, under pressure or stressed: for example, if we have an exam, job interview or doctor’s appointment. Anxiety isn’t necessarily a bad thing. It can spur us on, help us stay alert, make us aware of risks and motivate us to solve problems. However, anxiety can be a problem if it affects your ability to live your life. If your anxiety is ongoing, intense, hard to control or out of proportion to your situation, it can be a sign of a mental health problem. Help is available no matter how long you’ve felt anxious or severe your symptoms. There are many different types of treatment, sotalk to your GPabout all your options. Anxiety can affect both your body and mind. The effect on your mind can include: Physical feelings can include: Anxiety can also affect your behaviour. You may withdraw from friends and family, feel unable to go to work, or avoid certain places. While avoiding situations can give you short-term relief, the anxiety often returns the next time you’re in the situation. Avoiding it only reinforces the feeling of danger and never gives you a chance to find out whether your fears are true or not. Some people with anxiety may appear to be fine on the outside while still having some of the symptoms listed above. You may have developed ways of hiding your anxiety so that other people don’t notice it. If your anxiety symptoms meet certain criteria, your GP may diagnose you with an anxiety disorder. Some common anxiety disorders include: Anxiety disorders are among the most common mental health problems. Up to 1 in 20 people in the UK have a generalised anxiety disorder. Many different factors can make anxiety disorders more likely to happen. These include genetics, painfullong-term health conditions,traumatic eventssuch as childhood abuse or domestic violence, ordrugoralcoholmisuse. Your current life situation can also trigger anxiety – for example,moneyorhousingproblems, unemployment,work stress,loneliness, bullying, or difficult family or personal relationships. There are different ways to treat and manage anxiety disorders. The right treatment for you will depend on your type of anxiety disorder, how severe it is and your circumstances. The first step to getting support is usually tospeak to your GP. This might feel hard, especially if your anxiety makes it difficult to speak on the phone or leave your home. See if you can book an appointment online or ask someone to call up to book it for you. They could also come with you to your appointment for support. Or you couldrefer yourself for talking therapy(in England only) if that feels easier. Your GP will assess you during your appointment and then explain your treatment options. Your GP may offer you self-help resources such as workbooks or online CBT courses. These are often available quite quickly and may be enough to help you feel better without trying other options. NHS Inform has anonline anxiety self-help guideyou can work through. This involves working through your thoughts, feelings and behaviours with a mental health professional. Two kinds of therapy are particularly recommended for anxiety. Different medications manage both the physical and psychological symptoms of anxiety. Talk to your GP about which one might be right for you. The NHS website has more information about medication for anxiety disorders.

There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. Mild depression can make you feel low and as though everything is harder to do. Severe depression can lead to feeling hopeless and, in some cases, suicidal. If you’re depressed, you’re not alone. In England, 3 in every 100 people will experience depression in any given week. Even more – 8 in every 100 – will experience mixed depression andanxiety. (Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey: Mental Health and Wellbeing, England, 2014).

It can affect your mind, body and behaviour. You might feel: Physical symptoms can include: You might behave differently. You may: Some people experiencepsychosisduring a severe episode of depression. This means you may see or hear things that aren’t there or believe things that aren’t true. Your doctor may diagnose you with depression and say that it’s mild, moderate or severe, depending on your symptoms and how severe they are. Or you may be diagnosed with a specific type of depression, such as: Depression is a complex condition. Different factors can lead to it, including genetics, physical health problems, difficult childhood experiences and stressful life events such as unemployment, the end of a relationship, or being bullied or assaulted. You may find that a combination of factors led to your depression, or there might not be an obvious cause. The first step to getting support is to speak to your GP. Many people wait a long time before seeing their GP, but the sooner you go, the sooner you can start to recover. If you’ve felt depressed for a long time, you may feel like it’ll always be part of your life - but try to stay open to the possibility of change. There are many different types of help available now. A common treatment for depression involves a combination of self-help, talking therapies and medication. The right treatment for you will depend on the type of depression you have and how severe it is. Your GP may offer you self-help resources. These are often available quite quickly and may be enough to help you feel better without trying other options.

You can take them on their own or while having talking therapy. There are several different types of antidepressants, so talk to your GP about which one might suit you best.

6,https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/a-z-topics/postnatal-depression,Postnatal depression,"This content mentions abuse or violence, trauma, depression and anxiety, which some people may find triggering. Having a baby is a huge life event. It’s normal to experience a range of powerful emotions while you’re pregnant and after giving birth: excitement, joy, and anxiety. You may also feel depressed. It’s not a sign of weakness or anything to feel guilty about. With support and treatment, you can get better. While most people have heard of postnatal depression, it’s also possible to experience antenatal depression while you’re pregnant. Some people experience both. The term ‘perinatal depression’ covers depression at any time, from getting pregnant to around a year after giving birth. We’ve used the term ‘postnatal depression’ on this page as it’s more well known, but the symptoms and treatment for antenatal or perinatal depression are the same. The ‘baby blues’ is a brief period of feeling low, emotional and tearful after giving birth. It doesn’t last for more than two weeks after giving birth. If your symptoms last longer or start later, you could have postnatal depression. It can start any time in the year after giving birth and may begin gradually or suddenly. It can range from mild to severe. It might be difficult to talk about how you’re feeling. You may feel people expect you to be happy or worry you’re a bad parent if you tell someone you’re depressed. Remember that postnatal depression can happen to anyone and isn’t your fault. It’s never too early or late to get help. The symptoms of postnatal depression are similar to the symptoms ofdepression. They include: You may feel detached from your baby or partner. You may even have thoughts of hurting yourself or your baby. It can be very frightening to have thoughts of harming your baby but remember, this doesn’t mean you’re actually going to hurt them. The sooner you can talk to someone about your thoughts and feelings – a friend, relative, doctor or midwife, for instance – the sooner you can get the help you need. Only people who have given birth in the last year can be formally diagnosed with postnatal depression, but evidence suggests partners can also experienceanxietyordepression. This is a huge life change for them too, and dealing with a lack of sleep, extra household responsibilities and financial worries, for example, can be very difficult. Help and support are available, either through their GP or specialist organisations such as theNational Childbirth Trust, theFatherhood InstituteorPANDAS. There are many reasons why someone can develop postnatal depression. These include: For many people, a combination of factors causes postnatal depression. If you’ve experienced mental health problems in the past,tell your GP, health visitor and/or midwife. They can support you during and after pregnancy. Being depressed doesn’t mean you’re a bad parent or that you’re going mad. Some people worry it will mean their baby will be taken away from them. Remember that asking for help means you’re doing the best for your baby: it’s good parenting. Healthcare professionals will want to support you so you can look after your baby. Children are only taken into care in very exceptional circumstances. If you have symptoms of postnatal depression,speak to your GP, health visitor and/or midwife. It’s never too late to seek help: you can feel better even if you’ve had symptoms for a long time. Different help is available depending on how severe your symptoms are. You could be offered a self-help course or talking therapy such asCognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). You canrefer yourself for talking therapyin England. CBT can help you see how the ways you think and behave may be making you feel depressed. For example, you may have unrealistic expectations about being a parent and feel you should never make a mistake. CBT can help you see these thoughts are unhelpful and help you find a different way to think about parenthood. Antidepressants can help if your depression is severe or if talking therapy hasn’t helped. If you’re breastfeeding, your GP can recommend one that’s safe to take. Specialist services are available if you need more support. These include: Our page ondepressionhas ideas on ways to look after yourself. As well as these, try to build a support network so you can meet friends and other new parents for a chat. Accept offers of help: don’t feel you have to do everything yourself.

You may experience symptoms such as hearing or seeing things that aren’t there, believing things that aren’t true, mood swings, feeling confused and behaving in a way that is out of character. Symptoms usually start suddenly, often within hours or days of giving birth. Postnatal psychosis (also known as postpartum psychosis) should be treated as a medical emergency. If you or your partner think you may have postnatal psychosis, seek medical help immediately from your GP, A&E or crisis team if you have one.

Gabi tells us how turning 30 was a bit of a milestone for her. But alongside the celebration and her happy feelings of being loved by so many, her life wasn't matching up to her expectations. While she had a great job, other things like not having a relationship or children started to make her feel lonely and this was affecting her mental health. For me, loneliness isn’t just sitting in an empty room or house with no one to talk to, it was about what was going on inside and how I was feeling and that I didn’t understand what was going on. I had lots of the physical symptoms ofdepression, I just didn’t recognise them. My skin was dry, my hair was falling out and I lost a significant amount of weight. I didn’t understand the constant noise in my head, and just getting up in the morning and functioning took every ounce of my energy. I didn’t understand what was happening and I didn’t tell anyone except my best friend. It felt more lonely because I couldn’t speak about it because things didn’t make sense. Building up the courage to tell people how I was feeling was hard. It’s that feeling of not wanting to admit that you’re not ok, in a world where we’re told to ‘suck it up, everything will be ok.’ The reality for me was that it wasn’t. Once I’d started my therapy and could feel I was making progress, one of the first things I wanted to do was to tell my colleagues at work. I needed to tell them what had happened. I kept things very top-line, but explaining out loud really helped and immediately made me feel less lonely because people knew. And from that moment I began to feel better about myself and found I told another person every week or so. Everyone has been very supportive and no one has treated me any differently. Feeling heard makes things so much better. Of course, it’s much easier to talk once you’re getting better and getting the support you need, but I wish I could have spoken to people earlier when I really needed people the most. I’m not ashamed of what happened and I live with it now. On days when it feels like loneliness is creeping in and I realise I haven’t spoken to people for a while or it feels like things have caught up with me, I can recognise I need help. We spend so much time at work and with our colleagues and I think there’s a huge amount we can do to create workplaces and relationships where conversations can happen. I’m the chair of a mental well-being group at work and want to equip people to be able to have those conversations. In the same way, my peers and colleagues looked out for me, I want to look out for my team in return. I feel so much more in control of my well-being as a result of my therapy and want to share what I’ve learned. If I wake up and feel like it’s going to be a difficult day, then I rewrite my to-do list and set new targets that are realistic. I know what I’ll be able to achieve and what I won’t, and I know that the next day will be better. I want my team to know they can do that too.

A milestone birthday made me feel lonely even though I was surrounded by loved ones. My experience oflonelinessspiralled intodepressionbut looking back on this period, I can see how talking to people helped my recovery. In 2019, I turned 30. I had the most amazing celebrations - I celebrated with lots of family and friends over about five days and at the end of it I remember crying because I felt so loved. I didn’t realise it at the time, but there was something about reaching that milestone and reflecting on what I perhaps imagined my life would have looked like that contributed to me becoming very unwell. I had a good job and a career, but lots of the other things I’d expected just hadn’t materialised. I didn’t own my own home, I wasn’t married or in a relationship and I didn’t have children. It was the tip of the iceberg. I started to become unwell and things began to spiral. Loneliness was an experience where I could be surrounded by all the people that I love, or be in a really exciting meeting at work, but still feel completely disconnected. Things had built up over the years, but by the end of that year, I was extremely unwell and had been referred to the mental health service.

Talia first experiencedlonelinesswhen she moved away from her family to study at university. She talks about her feelings and how they got worse during the pandemic lockdowns. She found a lot of support when she began working for Single Parents Wellbeing and this helped her to share her experiences with other people who had similar experiences. I’m Talia, I’m 24 and I live in Cardiff with my daughter. My first experience of loneliness was when I moved away from my family to university. I experienced a second period of loneliness during the pandemic, this affected my mental health and I began to battleanxiety. For the first three years of my daughter's life, we were surrounded by family. People say ‘it takes a village’ and I was lucky enough to have that. It was wonderful. I underestimated the impact of moving away from home when I started university. I’d been in the same place for 18 years and suddenly all of those friendships and family were far away. I assumed it’d be easy to make friends, but the nature of my course meant I only had five contact hours a week. I’d arrive, take notes and then the lecture would be over and everyone disappeared. I lived on the other side of the city and my situation was different to the other students and that initially made it harder to form friendships too. I was really lonely and craved places where I could feel myself and among family. I found a new church and met two girls there who made a massive difference. They invited me for lunch one day and I think they saw that I was lonely. After that, they often invited me and Lily around for dinner. They were just amazing people. They had a motto ‘enough in the pot for ourselves, plus extra’, so they’d always cook enough food so they could share. They welcomed and accepted me. They changed my life and helped me to feel less lonely. I also experienced loneliness during the pandemic. I’d finished uni and Lily was 7. I’d been working in schools but always only for a few days at a time, so it was difficult to form friendships through work. Then overnight I lost my job because the schools were closed, and I was trying to home-school too. It was difficult. I started to experienceanxietyand it was terrifying. I didn’t know what was happening. I wish I’d been better at communicating what I needed. My family wanted to help but they didn’t understand what I was going through. At that time I needed reassurance and support every day because my experience was 24/7. They didn’t realise that I needed daily contact. I internalised that a bit and thought ‘well they should know, I shouldn’t have to ask,’ but that’s not a helpful way to think. If you’re honest about what you need and how you feel people will be there for you. The first six to nine months of the pandemic were the loneliest and hardest. Partly because it was all new - I didn’t know what was happening and couldn’t recognise the anxiety, but also because I was ashamed. I was embarrassed about how I felt and embarrassed to keep talking about it. I felt I was having the same conversation again and again so I stopped talking to people. That made me feel more lonely and isolated. I needed reassurance that things were going to be alright and that I would feel better. And I needed to hear that day after day. I was in a new relationship and my partner was amazing. He didn’t see my need for reassurance as a weakness, he was wonderful. I saw a job advert forSingle Parents Wellbeing(SPW) and knew instinctively that it was a good thing. My anxiety was still quite bad and I didn’t want to be totally honest about how I felt because it was a new job, but they really helped me through things. By connecting with other people who’d had similar experiences, I could better understand how I was feeling and felt less lonely. SPW is a social enterprise that empowers single parents, everything they do is peer-led and they really tap into the power of their network as single parents are amazing! It’s run by compassionate people, and most of the team are single parents themselves, and that compassion is for everyone - staff included. They've recently developed a mental health in the workplace policy that has compassion and community at the heart of it. It made a real difference to be surrounded by people who understood me and cared about me, my family and my mental health. After I joined SPW, I completed one of their well-being programmes. The six-week course is available to single parents and covers mental health, self-confidence and positivity. It was exactly what I needed and helped me to heal and recover from the anxieties I was facing at the time. The pandemic was tough for us all. I'm so proud of myself and of Lily for what we’ve achieved. I have known loneliness and I know how that lack of connection can damage your mental health, but I also know that those moments pass. Working at SPW has changed my life. It’s been like finding another family and that’s what I needed. I’m excited about the future and I’m excited about the difference I’ll be able to make for other single parents and young people as part of the team.

11,https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/how-overcome-anxiety-and-fear,How to manage fear and anxiety,"This content mentions anxiety and panic attacks, which some people may find triggering. It’s normal to feel afraid and anxious sometimes, such as when managing work pressures, exam stress, money problems, and relationship issues. But when fear and anxiety symptoms become long-term or take over your life it can affect your wellbeing. This guide explains where fear and anxiety come from, how they can affect you, and ways to cope and seek support. Download publication To help you better understand what fear and anxiety are and ways to cope, this page covers: The words ‘anxiety’ and ‘fear’ are often used to describe similar feelings, such as dread and worry. However, as much as anxiety symptoms can feel like fear, they aren’t quite the same. Fear is a powerful emotion that produces a physical response which helps us react to threats or dangerous situations. Yet fear can also happen in everyday, non life-threatening events such as exams, arguments, or even during social occasions like parties. Even though fear is a natural response to situations that make us feel under pressure, when it’s out of proportion to the event that triggered it, it could be problematic. Ongoing fear can also be a symptom of mental health conditions, such as anxiety. Anxiety is a type of fear we feel around things such as health, finances, and relationships, and is a normal issue for a lot of people. Anxiety symptoms can be described as ongoing feelings of dread about something going wrong in the present or future. It can also be about something that went wrong in the past.  When anxiety lasts for a long time it can disrupt everyday life, such as the ability to sleep, concentrate, and socialise. It can also lead you to believe that you’re unable to cope with daily tasks, holding you back from enjoying life and creating a cycle where anxiety becomes worse and affects your mental health. There are many types of anxiety which can cause people to worry about different things, and it’s normal to experience symptoms of more than one.  Some of the most common types of anxiety are listed below. Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is when you worry about lots of different things and these fears feel disproportionate and out of control. As GAD can increase the risk of sleeping difficulties, mood problems, concentration issues, and physical symptoms, it can affect daily life.1 Social anxiety is an intense fear of social situations. It includes symptoms like avoiding socialising, fear of public speaking, worrying a lot before social events, feeling like you’re being criticised by others, and physical symptoms such as trembling and sweating.2 Health anxiety is when someone worries a lot about being or becoming ill. It can take over daily life as it includes symptoms such as frequently scanning the body for signs of sickness, seeking constant reassurance from medical professionals, and physical feelings of actually being ill.3 A phobia is an extreme fear of a particular animal, thing, place or situation. Phobias affect everyday life as they can cause an overwhelming need to avoid the source of fear. Even the thought of coming into contact with the cause of fear can potentially intensify anxiety or panic attacks.4 A panic attack is when you feel overwhelmed by physical and mental feelings of fear. It’s a type of anxiety attack, in which people might find it hard to breathe, feel like they’re having a heart attack, or are losing control of their body. If you experience physical symptoms such as tightness in your chest or shortness of breath, it’s important to speak to a healthcare professional to rule out other underlying causes. Long-term anxiety and fear can be overwhelming, especially if you don’t know why you’re experiencing them or if they feel out of proportion to the situation. If fear and anxiety are affecting your daily life, speaking to a mental health professional for support and advice may be the best first step towards managing them.  In the meantime, there are practical anxiety relief actions you can take to cope with your fears. Recognising that you’re feeling anxious and where it’s coming from is a great step toward learning how to overcome it. You can do this by paying attention to your feelings and writing down a name for them. For example, do you feel concerned, scared, or nervous? Recognising these feelings can help you figure out where they come from. Try to remember what was happening when you first noticed fear; where were you, who were you with, and what was said? When we pinpoint a trigger, we can start noticing our thoughts around it and how they make us feel anxious. With practice, we can even challenge negative thoughts and beliefs, and replace them with more accurate ones. If you notice anxiety starting to build, you can stop it from taking over by managing it in the moment. One way of doing this is practising one-minute mindfulness, as it’s a great way to quickly and easily reset your mind and body. Try to find a comfortable place to sit or stand, pay attention to the sensations in your body, concentrate on your breathing, and notice how the feelings in your body change in response. Another useful way of managing your anxiety in the moment is to keep a list of statements or reminders about yourself to hand. Make these statements meaningful to you, for instance, ‘I feel fearful, but it doesn’t define who I am as a person’. Testing your fears and whether the situation is as bad as you expect it to be gives you the chance to see anxiety for what it is and build confidence. You can test your fears by setting small, achievable goals. For example, if you have social anxiety, you could reduce fear by smiling at people in passing. Then, as your comfort levels increase, you can build up to bigger tasks such as saying ‘hello,’ asking questions, or starting a conversation. After you attempt each small goal, try writing down what went well and how what happened compared to your fears. Many people judge themselves for feeling anxious, but it’s a normal emotion, so you don’t have to deal with it alone. The act of talking about anxiety can help reduce it and encourage you to seek more support if needed. If you have a friend or family member you feel confident will respond supportively, perhaps consider opening up to them about what’s going on. If you feel nervous about speaking to them, you could prepare for the conversation by noting down a few things you want to say or sending them an email to read ahead of time. The body and mind are connected, so even short bursts of movement, such as a ten-minute walk or gentle stretches can be good for anxiety relief. Exercise also boosts ‘feel good’ chemicals in the brain, improving mood and taking your mind off your fears.5 Boost your mood by moving more When we’re anxious, we may not realise that we’re not taking any ‘downtime,’ and end up increasing our worries. Finding meaningful ways to relax can be an enjoyable method of reducing the physical and mental feelings of fear. Relaxation means something different for everyone; for you, it might mean taking a bath, reading a book, or relaxation techniques like deep breathing and mindfulness meditation. Many of us don’t realise the link between anxiety and diet. For example, caffeine can lead to feelings of nervousness and a high-sugar diet can cause blood sugar to drop and make you feel anxious. So try to avoid eating a lot of sugar or drinking too much tea and coffee. Try to eat regularly to stop your blood sugar levels from dipping and make you feel tired or bad tempered. For more information on a healthy diet, visit theNHS Eatwell guide. Diet and mental health People often drink alcohol when feeling fearful or stressed – it’s where the saying ‘Dutch courage’ comes from! But alcohol can make us feel even more fearful or anxious when its effects wear off as it has a depressant effect on the brain. Plus, we may also have low blood sugar or feel tired and dehydrated after alcohol. It can even lead to what many people call ‘hangxiety.’7 So, if you feel fearful or stressed, try to avoid using alcohol as an anxiety coping mechanism. Our guide onhow to manage and reduce stressoffers healthy ways of coping with stress. Religion or spirituality can help people feel connected to something bigger than themselves. If you are a person of faith, attending places of worship or meeting with faith groups can help you cope with everyday stress and connect you with a support network. If fear or anxiety is affecting your ability to live a full life, there is support available to you, such as the following options. Talking therapies have proven to be very effective in helping people with anxiety management. Depending on your fear and anxiety symptoms and causes, your GP may recommend one of the following talking therapies:  If you would like more information on a suitable talking therapy for your anxiety, your GP may be able to help.  In England, you can also refer yourself toNHS Talking Therapies.  In Scotland theLiving Life servicecan be accessed through NHS 24. In Wales,Silver Cloudis accessible through their website. In Northern Ireland visitCommunity Wellbeingfor support. If anxiety is affecting your day-to-day life, your doctor may talk to you about the option of anxiety medications. Medications for anxiety include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).7  Anxiety medications treat the symptoms rather than the root causes. Therefore, while they often play an important role in anxiety management, they may be most useful when combined with other treatments, such as talk therapy. Local anxiety support groups can help you learn a lot about anxiety management as they bring together people with similar experiences. In such groups, opportunities to share stories and provide tips and encouragement for coping with anxiety are openly given. MindandReThink Mental Illnessboth offer online support forums. If you would like details of in-person support groups near you, your doctor, library, or local Citizens Advice Bureau can help. Printed copies of this publication are available in our online shop.

Anxietyis a familiar emotion because it is part of everyone’s experience. Its natural function is to alert us to potential threats, allowing us to evaluate and respond to them in appropriate ways. This heightened state of readiness can also help people perform better and stimulate creative impulses. Anxiety is often regarded as an artefact of modern societies, one that is increasingly represented in visual arts, music, literature and social media. For some people anxiety triggers inappropriate or disproportionate responses to perceived threats, leading to persistent and intrusive symptoms associated with anxiety disorders, such aspanic, phobias andobsessive behaviours, which often have a debilitating effect on their lives. Anxiety is one of the most prevalent mental health problems in the UK and elsewhere, yet it is still under-reported, under-diagnosed and under-treated. This report explores the intersection between popular perceptions of anxiety, the experience of anxiety in people’s everyday lives and the impact of anxiety disorders.

13,https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/all-about-depression-booklet,All About Depression booklet,"This content mentions depression, which some people may find triggering. This booklet is for anyone who wants to know more aboutdepression. You may be experiencing depression yourself and wondering where to find help. You may be supporting a friend or relative who seems to be depressed, or you may work with people who have symptoms of depression. This booklet will give you information about depression and the kinds of help, which are available. At the end of the booklet you will find details of useful organisations, as well as examples of further reading. We have included extra information on depression in older people, since depression in this age group is often overlooked. The message of this booklet is that depression is a common and serious mental health problem, but there are many ways you can help yourself to recover and resume a happy and fulfilling life. The more information you have, the better you will be able to ask for the help you need. The worddepressionis used to describe a range of moods – from low spirits to a severe problem that interferes with everyday life. If you are experiencing severe or 'clinical' depression you are not just sad or upset. The experience of depression is an overwhelming feeling which can make you feel quite unable to cope, and hopeless about the future. If you are depressed your appetite may change and you may have difficulty sleeping or getting up. You may feel overwhelmed by guilt, and may even find yourself thinking about death or suicide. There is often an overlap between anxiety and depression, in that if you are depressed you may also become anxious or agitated. Sometimes it is difficult to decide whether you are responding normally to difficult times, or have become clinically depressed. A rough guide in this situation is that if your low mood or loss of interest significantly interferes with your life (home, work, family, social activities), lasts for two weeks or more, and brings you to the point of thinking about suicide then you may be experiencing clinical depression and you should seek some kind of help. Anyone can become depressed. Approximately one person in six experiences depression of some kind in the course of their lifetime and one in 20 experiences clinical depression. At any one time, about one in 10 people will have some symptoms of depression. Of course, people who are depressed do not always seek help and even if they do, they may not always be diagnosed as depressed, so these figures are only estimates. People from all backgrounds, ages and cultures can experience depression, although people vary in how they express their difficulties. For example, some people use words such as ‘sad’ or ‘low’ to describe feeling depressed, whereas other people describe their feelings in terms of their body, such as ‘a pain in my heart’. In many Western countries women are more likely than men to be diagnosed with depression, this is partly because men are less likely to talk about problems in a way that allows their depression to be picked up. Men are also more likely than women to use alcohol to cope with feeling depressed. About two per cent of children under 12 experience depression. This rises to about five per cent for teenagers. A particular worry is the rise in the numbers of young men who attempt suicide, which may be associated with depression, hopelessness, or difficulties in their lives. Depression in both women and men is often linked to life changes or to loneliness. About 10 per cent of women experiencepost-natal depressionin the weeks following childbirth. Social factors which can make people more at risk of becoming depressed includeloss of employment, bereavement and problems with relationships. People over 65 seem to have a slightly greater risk of depression. This risk gets much higher in people over 85 years old. It can be particularly difficult to recognise depression in older people because they are less likely to talk about feeling sad or low, and more likely to talk about physical problems such as loss of energy ordifficulty sleeping. This means that GPs, family and friends may not understand how they are feeling. In older people it appears that depression is less likely to ‘lift’ without help, particularly if they are severely depressed. This may explain why older depressed people have a high suicide rate, particularly men over the age of 75 years old. Depression can also be confused with the effects of other health problems, which are more common in later life. People who are depressed often report feeling confused and having difficulty in thinking and remembering things. In older people it is important to find out whether these problems are due to depression or to the development ofdementia– for example in Alzheimer's Disease or following a stroke. Professionals look for the following key symptoms when deciding if you are depressed: You are likely to receive a diagnosis of depression if you experienceat least fiveof these symptoms over a two-week period. However, the most important signs are depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, or a loss of interest or pleasure in things you previously enjoyed. People have different patterns of depression; for example some people are severely depressed for a relatively short time while others have milder depression over a number of years. Even if the depression seems mild it is still important to identify it, as it can have a big impact on your life and you are more likely to face serious depression later on in life. The following are some specific types of depression which have been identified. About one per cent of the population will experiencebipolar disorderat some time in their lives. A diagnosis of bipolar disorder means that you have both ‘high’ and ‘low’ mood swings, along with changes in thoughts, emotions and physical health. The mood swings are normally more extreme than everyday ups and downs. This problem is sometimes also referred to as manic depression. Most people with bipolar disorder have their first episode of depression in their late teens or early twenties, and without treatment it is very likely to recur. For further information contact theManic Depression Fellowship. About 10 to 15 per cent of women experiencepost-natal depressionin the first year after having a baby. They may be unusually tearful, anxious or irritable, and may also find it difficult to play with their babies and respond positively to them. Although most women get the so-called ‘baby blues’ in the first few days after childbirth because of rapid hormone changes, post-natal depression is very different from this and lasts longer. It is probably due to a mixture of biological, psychological and social factors, and women are particularly at risk of post-natal depression if they do not have a supportive partner or family to help them. If you seem to be showing signs of post-natal depression your Health Visitor should be able to assess you and either provide help or refer you to another professional. Most women with post-natal depression are helped by supportive counselling, by talking to other women who have been through a similar experience, and by anti-depressant medication. For further information contact theAssociation for Post-natal Illness. Some people describe feeling depressed regularly at certain times of the year. A key feature of this kind of depression is the desire to sleep more and eat carbohydrate foods. Usually this kind of depression, known asSeasonal Affective Disorder, starts in the autumn or winter, when daylight is reduced. If you experience this kind of depression you may be helped by specially designed bright light therapy. For further information contact theSAD Society. There are many possible causes of depression. You may have an increased risk of experiencing depression because of your particular biological make-up. On the other hand, depression is also related to what is happening in your life, and the kind of support you receive from others. There is some evidence that depression seems to run in families, but there is no single gene which causes depression. A family history of depression may increase the risk, but this may be because of difficulties the family has in coping, and it certainly does not mean that depression is inevitable. Genes seem to be more important than childhood experiences in determining the risk of bipolar disorder. We know that depression is associated with changes in the activity of certain brain chemicals, known as neurotransmitters, which affect our mood and thinking. These chemicals, such as serotonin, are also affected by factors such as activity and exercise. Drug treatment aims to restore 'normal' levels of neurotransmitter activity (see section below entitled 'Coping with severe depression - what works? i) Drug Treatment'). Past experiences which may be difficult or traumatic, such as losing a parent when very young, can affect your ability to cope with difficult situations. Children who experience abuse or lack of affection are also more at risk of experiencing depression in later life. An episode of depression can be ‘triggered’ bystressful thingsthat happen in our lives, particularly events involvinga loss of some kind- such as unemployment, leaving home, death of a family member or friend. Even an apparently happy event can also bring a sense of loss; for example, parents can feel they have 'lost' their son or daughter when they get married, even if they are very happy for them. If you have had to cope with a lot of changes or stressful events, one more may seem like the 'last straw'. Older people often have to cope with repeated losses, including the death of close friends and family. There is an important difference between expressing grief - which is a healthy reaction to loss or bereavement - and depression. Men living alone after the death of their wives seem to be particularly at risk of depression. Young people also experience stress, for example due to problems at school, starting work or a course of study, or problems with relationships. It can be quite difficult to tell whether a young person is going through 'normal' adolescent turmoil or is showing signs of depression. People who are depressed tend to think about bad experiences in ways that make them even more difficult to manage. If you have had bad experiences in the past, which you were unable to control, you may develop a ‘hopeless’ way of thinking. Feeling ‘trapped’ in a difficult situation or experiencing a feeling of humiliation can also lead to negative thinking and depression. This is why some forms of treatment aim to help you change your patterns of thinking (see section below entitled 'Coping with severe depression - what works? ii) Non-drug treatment). We all tend to feel miserable when we are ill. Butlong-term health problems, which prevent someone from leading their usual life, may lead to depression. People who lose their eyesight or hearing can become depressed, as can people with heart disease, chronic lung diseases, and illnesses which prevent them from getting about, such as Parkinson’s disease or a stroke. Family and friends can help a lot by helping people find new activities or interests following illness. Some difficult life events may become more common with age, for example, children moving away, family illness or disability. Health or financial problems can also increase with age. However, many people find that there are positive benefits of growing older, such as having more free time, being able to take up hobbies, or spend time with grandchildren. It is therefore wrong to assume that depression in older people is a ‘normal’ reaction to growing older, and it is important that severe depression is recognised, so that people can get the help they need. There are a number of things you can do for yourself which can help you cope with mild episodes of depression, or reduce your risk of becoming seriously depressed. Having someone to turn to for support is very important when coping with difficulties. Some people build up a strong network of friends and relatives whom they can talk to, but others may become isolated, particularly if they have no employment or other activity outside the home. People who are already depressed usually find it very difficult to be sociable, and this can make them feel worse. So having someone to support you in a crisis or when things are difficult can reduce your risk of becoming depressed. If you are physically active or take regularexerciseyou may benefit from changes in your brain chemicals which affect mood, and from the feeling that you are actively doing something to improve your life. Exercise and activity can also bring important social contact if you are isolated. Outdoor activity seems to be particularly important in staving off depression for older men. However if you don't enjoy exercise it is unlikely to help. A healthydietis important in reducing the risk of depression. In particular, drinking too muchalcoholor takingdrugswill make you feel worse in the long-term. Some recent research has suggested that people who are depressed or have bipolar disorder may benefit from eating more oily fish, such as sardines, or from taking fish oil supplements, alongside their prescribed medication. However further research into this is needed. Many people are interested in using complementary therapies to relieve depression. There is evidence that the herbal medicine known as St John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) can help many people with mild to moderate depression. However, we do not yet know whether it is effective in treating more severe depression. Before taking St John’s Wort check with your doctor or pharmacist especially if you are taking other kinds of medication, for example for heart disease, epilepsy, asthma, or migraine, as St John’s Wort may effect how these drugs work. Relaxation techniques, aromatherapy, massage, and acupuncture, may also help people cope when they are feeling low. If you are trying a complementary therapy as well as receiving medical treatment you should inform your doctor so that the effects can be monitored. One aspect of depression is the feeling that, whatever you do, you cannot improve your situation. An important step is to find situations or activities where you can feel that you have some control over your life instead of feeling hopeless. Setting yourself small manageable goals can give you a sense of achievement and make you feel better. Older people in particular may feel that they are no longer valued as employees or needed as parents. Helping other people – for example through voluntary work – is one good way of feeling useful and valued. There are a number of self-help books, guides, and software programmes which can help you to learn ways of coping with mild to moderate episodes of depression. Some of these are listed at the end of this booklet. Bear in mind that although many people have found these helpful, everybody is different! If you do not find them helpful, or if your depression is more severe, you should ask for more specialist help. Some people find it very helpful to talk to others who have been through similar experiences. Some of the organisations listed at the end of the booklet can put you in contact with other people, individually or in groups. Anti-depressant drugsact by increasing the activity of those brain chemicals which affect the way we feel. Anti-depressants help between 60 and 70 per cent of people with depression. A number of different kinds of drugs may be prescribed, for example: Tricyclic anti-depressants are prescribed for moderate to severe depression. Some examples are dothiepin, imipramine, and amitryptyline. Tricyclic anti-depressants may take several weeks to start working so don't expect results straightaway. They sometimes cause drowsiness, so talk to your doctor if this is a problem. Other possible side-effects include blurred vision, a dry mouth, constipation, sexual problems, and weight gain. These side-effects can usually be reduced by changing to a different brand or by starting at a lower dose and gradually increasing it. Tricyclic anti-depressants are not addictive. Newer anti-depressant drugs - selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs and SNRIs) target specific chemical ‘messengers’ in the brain. The most well known SSRI is fluoxetine (Prozac) but there are several other brands. The most significant side-effects from these newer drugs are headaches, stomach upsets, and reduced sex drive. However some people become more anxious and restless when taking them and there have been reports of some people becoming aggressive. As with all drugs, if you have any unusual reactions you should discuss them with a doctor straightaway. For example, venlafaxine (Efexor) can cause a skin rash which should be reported to a doctor immediately. Lithium carbonate may be prescribed to people with bipolar disorder as a way of stabilising their mood swings. It is also sometimes used as an additional treatment for people with severe depression alongside anti-depressants. High levels of lithium in the blood can be dangerous, so if you are taking lithium you must have regular blood tests. Other mood stabilisers include carbamazepine. If you are prescribed drugs for depression you will probably be advised to take them for at least six months, or longer if you have a previous history of depression. Older people may have to carry on taking drugs for longer than younger people. You are more likely to 'relapse' (have another episode of depression) in the three months after you have started to recover - which is why doctors usually recommend taking the medication for a further six months. It is important to feel confident that you candiscuss your medication with your GPor pharmacist. Family and friends can help by encouraging you to report any unpleasant side–effects, especially when a new or different drug is prescribed. There are also special helplines which will give you general advice on medication. If you stop taking anti-depressant drugs suddenly you can experience unpleasant effects, such as headache, nausea, dizziness and even hallucinations. Always consult your doctor before stopping taking anti-depressants and never stop suddenly as the effects may be severe. Remember that it can take at least six weeks for you to begin to recover, but by six months four out of five people will be better. Tricyclic drugs have been used with children but they seem to be less effective than with adults. The newer SSRIs have not yet been adequately tested with children. As people grow older they are increasingly likely to be prescribed drugs for medical conditions. If drugs for depression are added there can be unexpected side-effects, such as dizziness and confusion. Sometimes just taking too many different drugs can produce symptoms of depression. People with memory problems may forget to take their drugs, particularly if they have lots of different drugs to take. You may like to ask the pharmacist to supply the pills in a 'dosette' - a special container, which has separate compartments for each day of the week, or each time of day. People diagnosed withdementia(such as Alzheimer’s disease) often experience depression, but anti-depressant drugs seem to be less effective for them than for other people of the same age. They may also experience more side-effects from medication, such as loss of appetite or increased confusion. Anti-depressant drugs should only be prescribed to people in nursing homes if they are actually depressed, not to deal with behaviour problems related to dementia. CBTis a type of talking treatment. It is based on the fact that the way we feel is partly dependent on the way we think about events (cognition). It also stresses the importance of behaving in ways which challenge negative thoughts and unhelpful beliefs. CBT aims to help you examine some of the beliefs you hold about yourself, often as a result of early experiences - such as 'I am worthless'. Although it may sound like common sense, CBT is not just positive thinking. If you are depressed, a CBT therapist will carry out an individual assessment and use questions and exercises to help you see your situation in different ways and to build up coping skills. It is important that CBT is delivered by someone who has been properly trained, such as a clinical psychologist or specially trained nurse. You may also find it useful to have someone to help with the activities such as 'homework' exercises. Research shows that CBT is effective for people with mild or moderately severe depression. A combination of drugs and CBT produces good results for severe depression. CBT may also reduce the risk of you experiencing another period of depression. CBT has been used successfully with children and young people, particularly those with moderate levels of depression. If you are older you are less likely to be offered talking treatments such as CBT, even though you are just as likely to benefit from them as younger people. Interpersonal therapy focuses on your relationships and on problems such as difficulties in communication, or coping with bereavement. There is some evidence that IPT can be as effective as medication or CBT but more research is needed. Counsellors are trained to help you think about the problems you are experiencing in your life and find new ways of coping with difficulties. They give support and help you find your own solutions, rather than offering advice or treatment, but some counsellors also use some of the techniques fromtalking therapiessuch as CBT. ECT is a controversial treatment which is used for people with severe depression in an emergency (for example when someone has stopped eating) or for people who have not responded well to other treatments. The person receiving ECT is given an anaesthetic and drugs to relax their muscles. They then receive an electrical 'shock' to the brain, through electrodes placed on the head. Most people are given a series of ECT sessions. Some people say that ECT is very helpful in relieving their depression, although others have reported unpleasant experiences, including memory problems. There has been a lot of concern about the way ECT has been used, and clearer guidelines and standards have now been developed. ECT cannot be given without your consent, except in very special circumstances, for example when your life is at risk. There is some evidence that older people may be given ECT rather than offered alternative forms of treatment. This may be because practitioners feel that older people take longer to respond to drug treatment, or because the drugs are not suitable for them. It is important that adequate time is given for drugs or other treatments to be effective before deciding to use ECT. Another important consideration is that people having ECT need a general anaesthetic, which carries more risks in older people. ECT should not be considered when people have severe heart or lung disease. The first step is to be honest with yourself: your sadness or unhappiness is interfering with your everyday life. While relatives and friends can often help you through 'bad patches', severe depression needs professional help. That doesn't mean you shouldn't tell people close to you what is going on if you can - it will help them to know, and their ongoing support can be very valuable. Some employers are sympathetic to those with mental health problems, although others may worry about the effects on your work and that you may need to take time off. You shouldvisit your family doctor (GP)who will probably offer some kind of treatment or support, or may refer you to a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist. It's important to remember that treating depression can take time, but you should be confident in the care you are receiving. If, for example, you would like to see a psychiatrist, you can ask your GP to make an appointment for you. Some people prefer to bypass their GP and consult a specialist privately. There are a number of places where you can go to get further help, as follows: Depression is a distressing experience but there are many kinds of help available. Sadly you may not always get the help you need, sometimes because you may feel too hopeless about your situation to ask. After reading this booklet you may like to discuss it with your GP or talk it through with family or friends. You may also like to contact one of the organisations or helplines listed below. Remember that most people do recover from depression and there is a lot you can do to help yourself. If you feel affected by the content you have read, please see ourget helppage for support. We all have times when we feel down, but depression is about more than feeling sad or fed up for a few days. Depression causes a low mood that lasts a long time and affects your daily life. Depression is a common mental disorder that causes people to experience depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep or appetite, low energy, and poor concentration. Understanding how depression affects your partner can be key to building a healthy, supportive relationship that supports both people’s mental wellbeing.

On 14 May 2022, I threw myself out of a plane! Actually, I was securely strapped to a qualified instructor who I put my complete faith in that they knew what they were doing! So why did I do this? For many years now I have lived withdepressionandanxiety. Depression has a habit of sneaking up when things start to get on top of me. It only takes a few triggers, and I can be sent into a tailspin. Thankfully, this doesn't happen too frequently, but when it does, it’s hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel. But from experience, I have found that there always is. Anxiety, however, plagues me on a daily basis. The analogy of the devil and angel on your shoulder is a pretty good way to sum up my internal dialogue. That little devil is always chattering about things that could go wrong and likes to point out my faults and failures. He reminds me regularly of all the things I am not good at and tells me I can't do things because I am afraid. When I think about it, I am afraid of a lot. Dying, flying, heights, small spaces, crowds, failure, sprouting eyes on potatoes... the list goes on! The worst thing is these fears stop me from having great experiences. I would avoid a trip to London for fear of having apanic attackon the train. Trips anywhere that involve trains and tunnels are avoided unless absolutely essential and have to be strategically planned to avoid busy periods. And as for planes, plummeting from the sky in a confined space with no means of escape, packed in with loads of people, is enough to send me running for the hills! I purposely haven't renewed my passport, which expired ten years ago, so I won’t be able to get on a plane. I would LOVE to go to a festival, but never have because I am afraid of crowds. At the start of the year, I decided that 2022 was the year I was going to stop being afraid. I am going to face my fears head-on! And what better way to tackle a lot of my fears in one than to do a skydive! I am also hoping that by doing this, I will also give other people who suffer the courage to face their fears too. The skydive was petrifying and exhilarating all in one go! There were moments of pure terror combined with sheer excitement and adrenaline. I don't think I could ever top that experience, but now I know that whenever I am floundering or thinking I can't do something - I will think back to the day when I threw myself out of a plane and know that I could do anything if I put my mind to it. And, of course, I wanted to raise lots of money for the Mental Health Foundation, which does so much work around raising mental health awareness and prevention. So far, I have raised £1420 for the Foundation. Thank you to everyone that has donated and supported me through this truly life-changing event! Make 2023 the year you do something amazing and take on a skydive for Mental Health Awareness week in May! If you feel affected by the content you have read, please see ourget helppage for support.

15,https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/stories/lukes-story-binge-eating-depression-and-how-my-obsession-fitness-wasnt-necessarily-good-thing,"Binge eating, depression and obsession with fitness","This content mentions substance abuse and addiction (which may include mentions of alcohol or drug use), body image and depression, which some people may find triggering. Luke talks here about binge eating, body image and depression and how an obsession with fitness and diving into some tough endurance challenges isn't necessarily a good thing. Staring at the bottom of a now empty tub of ice cream, I promised myself, this would be the last time! I hid behind closed doors during my late-night binge-eating sessions. Hiding removed me from the rest of the world, as I regularly overfed myself to experience a fleeting state of comfort. Sitting on my bed with headphones hugging my ears, I watched endless videos on YouTube, distracting me from the violent negative internal voices vying for my attention. As the sun rose, with its rays piercing through the curtains, I would remove my headphones, and start my day - acting as if the night before never happened. What compounded the flood of negative emotions I had each night, was the fact that I felt like (and was) living a double life. By day, I was paid to work with individuals and teams to not only help improve their physical performance but also, live a well-rounded, healthy life. I worked with people who wanted to lose weight, run marathons (and even ultra-marathons) or complete some other physical challenge they set themselves. I had clients who struggled to get out of their own way and accomplish their professional and personal goals, and I helped out in various ways. However, most nights, I was doing the complete opposite of what I prescribed to the people I worked with. I battled for years with the feeling of being a fraud and living this painful double life. To subdue this all-encompassing feeling, while at the same time, doing my best to ignore it, I took on and created some of the world’s toughest endurance challenges. From running 65 kilometres down Mount Everest, to running across the Sahara desert. I cycled 412 kilometres non-stop from London to Newquay in 18 hours - just to learn how to surf! I ran across a tropical forest in China, without any food, water, phone, or money, and with a plane to catch (but that's another story). I even completed a double Ironman triathlon in north Wales (aptly named The Double Brutal Extreme Triathlon), taking me 35 non-stop hours, before creating and completing a world-first, 2000 kilometres in a 12-day, Ultimate Triathlon from Morocco to Monaco. Some people will turn toalcohol, others todrugsorgamblingwhen dealing withdepression. For me, I became addicted toexercise, and not in a healthy way. Midnight marathons (literally running 40+ kilometres starting at midnight), eight-hour bike rides every weekend and fitting in as much swimming, cycling, running, and weight lifting as I could, around my clients and keynote speaking business. If I binged on ice cream and bread one night, I’d then go run for five hours the next. If I binged one afternoon then I wouldn’t eat dinner that night, or breakfast the next day. While making sure I filled that day with three, four or even five hours of exercise. The cycle was never-ending, as I was chasing something that wasn’t there to be caught - my happiness. It’s easy to hide being addicted to exercise because anyone can dress up like a wolf in sheep’s clothing. Exercising is healthy, if it’s done every day, then it must not only be healthy but by making the body fit and strong! While all of the above is true, too much exercise isn’t a good thing. Combined with binge eating,insomniaand depression, it’s a recipe for disaster! My addiction to exercise was a distraction from what was really going on in my life. I was literally running away from the real issue. I had changed careers and was lost. I lacked an identity, daily values as a human, and a direction in my life. The pain I felt due to this career change, carved out a canyon inside of me, which filled up with depression, insomnia, binge eating, and twice standing on tops of bridges not wanting to live for another second. I was ashamed of how I felt, and the actions I took, and that a man in his late twenties moving into his thirties couldn’t just ‘shake off’ what he was going through. My binge eating and insomnia fed my depression. However, at the same time, I used binge eating to help me cope with my depressive states. My depression was the reason I would binge and my inability to fall asleep. I was struggling to survive and completely lost in this destructive cycle. It took me four years of battling depression before I externalised it to anyone. And another three before I opened up to my friends and family. That's seven years of my life I battled with my mental health, and barely survived the double life I was leading. I remember waking up one day and realising something needed to change. If I was to stop living this double life, I needed to get help. With that thought, I had a choice to make. I could open up to someone I loved, and who loved me. Or, I could open up as little or as much of what I was going through to a stranger, and go from there. I chose the latter, and after several years oftherapy, and meeting this stranger on a weekly basis, I felt the internal strength to share what I had and was going through with those closest to me. To this day, it was the most rewarding and impactful thing I’ve ever done for myself. Allowing those people who truly care and love me to know the pain I was going through, filled me with a level of courage and support I never knew existed. I stopped living the double life I had led and started living my own life, one day at a time. These days I'm not hiding behind closed doors or ashamed of my past behaviour, but sharing my experiences to help others find their own internal strength, hoping they too will one day feel comfortable enough to speak up about what they are going through - whether that’s with a stranger or a loved one.

16,https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/our-work/public-engagement/mental-health-awareness-week/what-can-we-do-cope-feelings-anxiety,Coping with feelings of anxiety,"Anxiety is something we can all experience from time-to time. There are lots of reasons why we get this feeling. It can be connected to a job, school, a relationship, social situations, how we feel about ourselves, or a change in our life. If we don’t know how to cope with our feelings of anxiety, they can get out of control and stop us from doing the things we need or want to do. The more often and the longer we feel anxious, the more it can become a problem. Dealing with anxiety can be hard. But there are some things we can do to manage these tough feelings. Have a read through the following suggestions and find out what might work for you. When you’re having anxious thoughts try focusing on your breathing, concentrating on the feeling of your body as you breathe in and out. It can help you control the thought. Close your mouth and quietly breath in through your nose, counting to four in your head. Hold your breath and count to seven. Breathe out through your mouth, making a whoosh sound while counting to eight. Repeat three more times for a total of four breath cycles. Some people find relaxation exercises work too, while others findmindfulnessuseful. Exercise is a good way of dealing with anxiety. Remember, activity doesn’t have to be vigorous; try some gentle stretches, yoga, or seated exercises. Or just go for a walk. Going for a run, swimming, or taking part in a fitness class can give you something else to think about. It needs a bit of concentration, so takes your mind of the anxious thoughts. Any amount of exercise will help. Read more abouthow exercise can help improve our mental health. It’s important that we don’t try to ignore our worries. Taking the time to keep a record of what’s happening in your life and how it’s affecting you can help you understand what is triggering your feelings of anxiety. Knowing this can help you better prepare for and manage situations that may cause anxiety. Sometimes it helps to give yourself a certain time of day to be your ‘worry time’. It could be half an hour first thing in the morning for to sit with your worries and write them down in your diary. When that’s out of the way, you can move on with the rest of your day. This can help you take control and stop anxiety getting in the way of what you want to do. Anxiety can lead us to think about things over and over again in our brain. This is called ‘rumination’ and it’s not helpful. When you catch yourself ruminating try to write down the thought and to challenge it. Is what you’re worrying about likely to happen? Are you being realistic? Have you had similar thoughts which have not turned into reality? This can make it easier to challenge the thoughts and stop them from overwhelming you. A common cause of anxiety is money. If you’re worried about not being able to pay bills, are struggling to repay debt, or aren’t sure if youcan cover your family’s living costs, seek help. Make sure you are claiming all the government supports that you’re entitled to. You can also speak to an organisation such as Citizens Advice or StepChange. Check out our advice onhow to cope with cost-of-living pressuresandinformation on where to get practical support. We know that spending time in nature has a positive impact on our mental health. It can help us feel calmer and less stressed. This can be as simple as tending some flowers in a window box or going for a walk in the woods. Any amount of time doing this is good for us, but to really get the benefit, try to spend a significant period of time – maybe an hour or longer – when you can really connect with nature and immerse yourself.Find out more about the benefits of nature. Anxiety can feel very lonely. Connecting with other people can help a lot. Spend time with friends or meet other people through activities such as volunteering, sport or social clubs, or peer support groups. If you’re able to talk to people about how you feel, it can help to reduce your anxiety. Sometimes saying what’s worrying you out loud can take away its power over you. Resting and having a good night’s sleep is hard when your head is full of worries but there are some things that can help. If anxious thoughts keep you awake, write them down in your diary. If sleep is still not coming, get up and have a drink (nothing with caffeine!) and wait until you’re feeling more tired before going back to bed. Keeping a note in your diary of your sleep patterns, what time you went to bed, what you ate, how often you woke up etc can help you work out a routine that will help you get better quality sleep. For many of us, feeling anxious might cause us to reach for sugary snacks, junk food or alcohol. It’s important that we don’t turn to unhealthy foods or drinks as a way to cope as they will do more damage in the longer term. Similarly, we should avoid smoking or taking recreational drugs. Eating healthy food regularly helps us to regulate our blood sugar and gives us the energy we need to live well. Remember caffeine in coffee, tea and fizzy drinks can affect your mood and cause sleep problems so it’s best to have these in moderation and not too close to bedtime.Find out more about how your diet is linked to good mental health. If your feelings of anxiety are not going away, are having a negative impact on your life, or often prevent you from doing things you need or want to do, seek support.Speak to your GP or healthcare professionalabout the support available in your area orcontact a helpline service.

While it’s good that anxiety is getting more attention, many myths and confusion surround the topic. The Mental Health Foundation (MHF) has chosen anxiety as our Mental Health Awareness Week 2023 theme to provide a better understanding of what anxiety is, when it becomes a concern, and what we can do to help ourselves and each other when anxiety starts to become a problem. This briefing looks at what our research has uncovered: the prevalence and rates of anxiety amongst different groups of people, and the current key drivers and risk factors for anxiety. It then considers the main ways of coping with anxiety and provides recommendations to governments across the UK for preventing anxiety. However, we can’t tackle anxiety by only focusing on remedies for individuals. National and local policymakers must prioritise actions to promote good mental health for all and to reduce anxiety, particularly for people at the highest risk of experiencing persistent and overwhelming anxiety.

18,https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/our-work/public-engagement/mental-health-awareness-week/anxiety-report/what-causes-anxiety,What causes anxiety?,"Everyone’s experiences of anxiety are different, and the causes of anxiety can be complicated. What is clear is that the relationship between anxiety and any social and/or environmental factors is complex and bidirectional. Social and environmental factors can contribute to the development and maintenance of anxiety and affect our ability to engage effectively in social situations. These social and environmental factors can includechildhood trauma,social isolation, negative life events, stress relating to work or education, physical or mental health problems, and social and societal pressures.viGender can also play a part. Women are almost twice as likely to experience anxiety as men.vii Other studies suggest that women are more likely to experience physical and mental abuse than men, and abuse has been linked to the development of anxiety disorders.viii Individuals who experience social isolation or loneliness often have a reduced quantity or quality of social contacts compared to those who report positive social relationships. Social isolation can lead to difficulty initiating social interactions with others, often leading to feelings of rejection and insecurity. Similarly, loneliness can lead to negative self-evaluation and feelings of inadequacy, further heightening an anxiety response.ixWhile anyone can experience loneliness, certain risk factors increase our chances of severe and lasting loneliness that can affect our mental health and sometimes increase our levels of anxiety. These include:x Childhood trauma such as physical, emotional, or sexual abuse, or neglect, can cause long-lasting effects on a person’s mental health. Experiencing childhood trauma can predispose people to developing anxiety. This can be due to changes in brain development affecting our fight or flight response, memory, and emotion regulation. Childhood trauma can also lead to negative beliefs about oneself or the world, making it more difficult to manage stressful situations and increasing the likelihood of developing anxiety. Negative life events can also contribute to anxiety. These are events that cause a significant emotional impact and disrupt our sense of security or well-being. Examples of negative life events that can, for some people, lead to anxiety include: Societal pressures can contribute to feelings of stress or anxiety, as people feel the need to meet cultural or societal expectations, standards, or norms.xiiiFor example, the idealisation of a ‘perfect’ body can lead tobody dissatisfactionand anxiety about physical appearance.xivThe pressure to be successful, achieve high grades, or excel in your career can also lead to anxiety about performance and fear of failure. Gender and expectationscan lead to feelings of anxiety or depression, particularly for those who don’t hold specific gender roles. In addition,those who identify as LGBTQ+are around twice as likely to report symptoms of poor mental health (i.e. anxiety, depression) than heterosexual adults.xvAlthough LGBTQ+ people represent only a small proportion of the total youth population, they are at increased risk of experiencing hostile environments at home and in wider society and are also subject to direct and indirect discrimination, harassment, and inequality, with detrimental consequences for their mental health.xvi Societal pressures can also be gendered.Society has different expectations of men and of women as to how they express their emotions. Men are often socialised to suppress their emotions and hide their vulnerability. This can make it more difficult for men to recognise and seek help for anxiety, leading to a higher prevalence of undiagnosed or untreated anxiety among men. Financial status.Society’s expectation to achieve significant milestones and acquire certain goods or services may lead to feelings of inadequacy or anxiety about financial status. Many different factors can lead to unequal access to mental health resources and support. Some common barriers include waiting times, transport, education and literacy, language or cultural barriers, stigma and discrimination. When people are unable to access the right support at the right time, this can cause anxiety to worsen. Tammie speaks of thepressure of being a studentcontributing to feelings of anxiety: “The pressure to succeed and be great and not disappoint others is very prominent. Especially when the schools you have attended have fostered an extremely competitive environment. Any thought of falling short is very anxiety-inducing. “Also, I know that for a lot of people, when they started university, their feeling of social anxiety increased greatly. It was a very new and overwhelming environment.” Tammie also spoke about the effect racism can have on mental health: “Being a Black British young person has brought on many intense feelings of anxiety. There have been environments throughout my life that have been less than welcoming, and it becomes such an intense thought when I anticipate entering those environments again.“ The relationship between socio-economic status and anxiety is complex, and influenced by a variety of individual, familial, and environmental factors. However, the evidence is clear that experiencing material deprivation and financial strain increases a person’s risk of having a mental health problem such as anxiety. Specifically, poverty, unemployment, and low education levels can all increase the risk of someone developing anxiety. People experiencing financial stress and being unable to afford essentials including food, heat, and mortgage/rent due to rising inflation report higher levels of anxiety.xvii Deprivation is about more than a lack of money.It can include a lack of access to resources such as adequate housing and exposure to negative stressors, such as violence, abuse and crime, or a lack of public green space. A growing body of evidence suggests the relationship between deprivation and mental health is not just about the absolute lack of resources for individuals.xviii In our research, we asked those that had been anxious in the past two weeks what was the cause of their anxiety. The most commonly reported cause of anxiety was being able to afford to pay bills, reported by 32% of respondents. The top eleven causes of their anxiety are detailed below: We found that some specific groups of respondents were more likely than others to be anxious about paying bills: Thecost-of-living crisishas undoubtedly led to increased levels of material deprivation and financial strain in the UK population, which is putting people’s mental health at risk. Our research provides new evidence of the extent to which financial strain is negatively affecting people’s mental health, specifically their experience of anxiety. Worryingly, some of the behaviours that are protective of mental health (for example, getting enough sleep and maintaining connections with family and friends) are the very behaviours that people may be reducing to cope with the increased cost-of-living.

19,https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/our-work/public-engagement/mental-health-awareness-week/anxiety-report/who-has-anxiety-uk,Who has anxiety in the UK?,"In March 2023, the Mental Health Foundation worked with Opinium to conduct an online survey of 6000 UK adults aged 18+ to look at anxiety in the UK population, its causes, and popular coping mechanisms.1 What we found was that nearly three-quarters of the population (73%) had felt anxious at least sometimes in the previous two weeks, with 20% anxious most or all of the time. These levels of anxiety were highest amongst 18 to 34-year-olds,single parents, carers,people identifying as LGBTQ+andthose from Black and minority ethnic communities. For those who had felt anxious in the previous two weeks, more than a third (34%) stated it had interfered with their day-to-day life. Nearly half the young people (18 to 24-year-olds) in the research (45%) and students (48%) indicated that anxiety had affected their day-to-day life to a great or moderate extent. Figures were also high for both single parents (47%) and carers (41%). Our research also discovered that for just over a quarter (26%) of those suffering from anxiety, it had an even more profound effect on their life by stopping them doing what they needed to do most or all of the time. This was more apparent in some groups than others. Again, single parents (41%) and those with a long term condition (38%) experienced this the most. There are several factors that may explain the higher prevalence of anxiety among younger people compared to other groups. Increased academic or job stress and pressures could be impacting on their mental health. In ourThriving Learners studyamongst college students, those experiencing food insecurity were also experiencing high levels of depression and low levels of well-being.vIn addition,social media may add to their stressas they compare their experiences to those of others, feel pressure to present a perfect image online, and/or be a victim of cyberbullying. Anxiety can be particularly pronounced during adolescence and young adulthood. Changes at this time can be both new and stressful and may trigger feelings of uncertainty and fear, which can contribute to anxiety. Jazmine is a 21-year-old university student. She describes how feelings of anxiety can be hard to articulate and identify. “I have felt anxiety all my life but never knew what it actually was. I experienced social anxiety in school when I was afraid to talk and eat in front of others.I thought there was something wrong with me until I researched [it] and realised it is something most people experience. “As a bisexual, mixed-race woman with a disability, I feel like I’m a minority in society and many groups/forces are against people like me. It’s worrying to think that racism and homophobia still exist. “Social issues that have personally heightened feelings of anxiety for me are poverty, including worrying about where and how to gain an income.” Previous: What is anxiety?|Next: What causes anxiety?

20,https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/our-work/public-engagement/mental-health-awareness-week/anxiety-report/what-anxiety,What is anxiety?,"Anxiety is a common emotional state characterised by feelings of unease, such as worry or fear, that can range from mild to severe. Most people feel anxious from time to time. In many cases, this can be helpful in providing motivation or keeping us safe from harm. However, when anxiety becomes excessive, it can interfere with our daily lives and lead to distress, avoidance, and even physical symptoms such as heart palpitations, stomach upsets or shortness of breath.iv NOTE: If you are experiencing physical symptoms, it is important to speak to a healthcare professional urgently as they could also be caused by another serious health condition that requires immediate treatment. Anxiety can arise in response to various life events or circumstances, such as work stress,financial worries, or relationship problems in your family, at work, with friends or your life partner. In some cases, anxiety can become a constant feeling, and persist even when there is no apparent stressor or threat. Anxiety is a natural human response to stress or perceived danger. It’s a feeling of unease, worry, or apprehension that can be caused by anything from a big event or major change to something as simple as a work presentation or meeting new people. In fact, anxiety is part of the body’s natural ‘fight or flight’ response that helps us react quickly to potential threats. It is important to note that feeling anxiety is not the same as having an anxiety disorder, which is a diagnosable mental health condition characterised by persistent and intense feelings of anxiety that are out of proportion to the situation or event that triggered them. Rather, anxiety is a common and natural emotion. When it becomes persistent or overwhelming and interferes with daily life, it can turn into a problematic condition, that may be diagnosed as an anxiety disorder. However, there are ways to manage it and reduce its impact. This could involve using effective coping strategies and support, or changes to our circumstances or environment. Some of these changes require action at local and national government level to address some of the root causes of anxiety. Anxiety disorders are a group of mental health diagnoses characterised by excessive, persistent, and irrational fear or worry about everyday situations or events. These conditions are prevalent in the UK, with an estimated one in six adults (16%) likely to have some form of anxiety.ii There are several types ofanxiety disorders. Here are some examples: Symptoms of anxiety disorders can vary from person to person and may include a combination of physical, emotional, and behavioural symptoms. In the UK, anxiety disorders are often treated with a combination of therapy and medication.iii Anxiety disorders are common and treatable mental health conditions that can significantly affect an individual’s quality of life. If you are experiencing anxiety that is becoming disabling, seeking professional help is important in order to receive an accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.

21,https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/our-work/public-engagement/mental-health-awareness-week/stories-about-anxiety,Stories about anxiety,"Anxiety is a normal emotion for us all to experience on occasion. There are lots of things that can lead to feelings of anxiety or worry. Anxiety is one of the most common mental health problems we can face. It can be caused by big life events or pressures at work or school, such as losing a job or worrying about upcoming exams. Home of Mental Health Awareness Week",,,,Mental Health Foundation,no,,
22,https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/our-work/public-engagement/mental-health-awareness-week/anxiety-report/what-does-anxiety-feel-like,What does anxiety feel like?,"Anxiety can cause many different symptoms. It can affect how a person feels physically and mentally and how they behave. It’s not always easy to recognise when anxiety is the reason behind feeling or acting differently, but it is useful to be aware of the symptoms. Anxiety can affect everyone differently. Anxiety can have a significant impact on how a person interacts with the world around them. For example, anxiety can lead to social withdrawal, decreased productivity, and reduced quality of life. In some cases, it can cause avoidance behaviours that prevent individuals from pursuing education, work, or social opportunities, or from accessing essential resources such as health or social care or other forms of support.xix It can make it difficult to maintain interpersonal relationships, to conduct everyday activities independently and to work, and it can impact on the relationship we have with our environment. People with anxiety are more likely to miss days from work and are less productive. Young people with anxiety are also less likely to enter school and complete their education – translating into fewer life chances.xx Anxiety can cause vicious circles where the impact of anxiety can affect people in a way that exacerbates the causes of anxiety. In our survey, 29% of people identified work as a source of anxiety; the diagram shows how this might cause anxiety to escalate. A similar cycle can be illustrated by financial strain. Worries about money can have an impact on your mental health, making you more anxious. And anxiety can affect how you manage your money. Anxiety can have a significant impact on people’s social life and may create its own vicious circle. People experiencing anxiety may avoid social situations that they perceive as threatening or uncomfortable. This can lead to isolation and decreased social interaction. Anxiety can also impair an individual’s ability to communicate effectively in social situations, resulting in feelings of discomfort, self-consciousness, and embarrassment, which can further exacerbate social anxiety. This may combine with negative self-image, which can damage self-confidence and self-esteem in social situations. All of which can lead to reduced social support, as people become less likely to reach out to others for help or support. Anxiety can have a significant impact on relationships with others in several ways. It can interfere with effective communication, causing misunderstandings and disagreements with partners, family members, or friends. Anxiety can make it challenging for us to express ourselves clearly or make it difficult to listen to and understand other people. Anxiety can lead to trust issues, leading to doubt and suspicion of partners, friends, or family members. It can create a vicious cycle in which people assume their loved one is dishonest, leading to a decrease in trust and ultimately affecting the whole relationship. It can also affect an individual’s ability to establish and maintain intimacy with their partner or friends. Anxiety can lead to a fear of intimacy, distancing from others, and avoidance of emotional closeness. An individual suffering from anxiety may try to avoid conflict, leading to pent-up frustrations and ultimately a more significantly damaged relationship. Conversely, however, anxiety can also lead to higher levels of conflict in relationships as it can make people more defensive or quick to be hurt by small things. Anxiety can have an impact on physical health. One of the most common is bydisrupting sleep. Anxiety can make it difficult for people to fall asleep, stay asleep, or get restful sleep, which can lead to a wide range of negative health consequences. Poor sleep has been linked to an increased risk of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic health conditions.xxi Research has also found a more direct link between anxiety and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Anxiety can cause the release of stress hormones, which can increase blood pressure and heart rate, leading to chronic stress on the cardiovascular system. Anxiety can lead to unhealthy behaviours such as smoking, overeating, and sedentary lifestyles, all of which can contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease.xxii In addition, anxiety can have adverse effects on the immune system.xxiiiAnxiety has been shown to activate the body’s stress response, which can lead to a release of stress hormones such as cortisol. When cortisol levels are elevated for extended periods of time, it can weaken the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to infections, illnesses, and other health problems. When people feel anxious, they anticipate and worry about something ‘bad’ happening, such as something harmful to themselves or those they care about. What is anticipated as ‘bad’ or harmful will be different for different people and will depend on a range of factors including what experiences they have had in their lives. So, for people who have experienced a lot of shame (being judged, criticised, excluded, ignored, rejected) their anxiety may focus on their fear of further shaming experiences. As well as this ‘anxiety about shame’, anxiety can itself be shamed through being dismissed, ridiculed, laughed at, deemed ‘weak’ - including in a gendered way - or ignored. For people experiencing anxiety, the perception that ‘most people’ will have a negative attitude towards their condition reduces the chance they will seek support, both formally (e.g. from GPs or counselling) and informally (e.g. from family and friends). This was evidenced in our own research where we found that nearly half of those experiencing anxiety (45%) kept their anxiety secret – this was more likely in men (49%) than women (42%) and even higher amongst those from an Asian background (50%). We also found that many of those with anxiety (46%) would not tell their employer – again this is more pronounced in men (50%) than women (43%). Amongst males from a Black and minority ethnic background, this rises to 62%.

23,https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/our-work/public-engagement/mental-health-awareness-week/anxiety-report/coping-with-anxiety,Coping with anxiety,"Living with anxiety can be difficult. Not being able to cope with feelings of anxiety means they can get out of control and affect everyday life. The more often and the longer we feel anxiety, the more it can become a problem. With this in mind, we asked those who had been anxious the previous two weeks how well they were coping with their anxiety. Nearly a third of respondents (30%) stated they were not coping with their anxiety. Those more likely to say they were not coping were those that were unemployed (43%) followed by those in the LGBTQ+ community (41%): There are many coping strategies that people use to manage their anxiety. For example, looking after their physical health by moving more and eating healthily; talking to someone they trust; using stress management and relaxation techniques; and making sleep a priority. In our study, respondents used a variety of healthy coping mechanisms to manage their anxiety including taking time on their own (37%), exercising (34%), sleeping more (29%), connecting with friends/family (26%) and talking with trusted people (26%). There are, however, a number of unhealthy coping mechanisms that are commonly adopted. These are reflected in the behaviours reported by our respondents. The most common was avoiding trigger situations (22%), which can be very disabling and life-limiting and is one of the ways that anxiety can feed into isolation, loneliness and even phobias. It is also common for people todrink more alcoholorsmoke morein response to anxiety – again we see these responses reported by our survey respondents, with 15% reporting drinking alcohol and 9% smoking as a way of coping with their anxiety. Women were more likely to avoid trigger situations (24% vs 20%), while men were more likely to drink alcohol (19% vs 12%). People alleviate anxiety in different ways. For Tim, photography and photo editing has proved beneficial. He leads a photography group - ‘Artful Minds’ - in his hometown, sharing his love for photography and its mental health benefits with other people. Our research has shown the positive impact that being creative, socialising, learning and doing positive things for other people can have on our mental health, and this is evident in Tim’s experience. “I’ve found channelling my anxiety into something creative really helps. One thing I’ve really taken to is photography and editing photos to create art. Looking at the world through a lens can really change your perception of what you see. I find beauty in things I was oblivious to before, and I see possible photo opportunities all the time.” Read more of Tim's story Previous: What does anxiety feel like?|Next: Seeking support for anxiety Download the full report (PDF) Home of Mental Health Awareness Week",,,,Mental Health Foundation,no,,
24,https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/our-work/public-engagement/mental-health-awareness-week/anxiety-report/seeking-support,Seeking support for anxiety,"When you have anxiety, it is important to get support before it becomes a debilitating problem. There are many sources of support for anxiety, such as the NHS, mental health charities, online support and telephone helplines. In addition, social support is important for managing anxiety. In our study, respondents had indicated a wide range of support sources including social support from friends (28%) and siblings (20%) and more clinical support, such as the GP (28%) and NHS mental health services (20%). There is a body of evidence around men’s reluctance to seek help for mental health problems and many studies support the generally-held assumption that men are less likely than women to get assistance from professionals for mental health problems.xxivThis was also reflected in our study where we noted that men were less likely to go to their GP (26% vs 29%) or a therapist (18% vs 22%). We also found men were less likely to have sought support from friends (23% vs 31%). This was even more prominent amongst men from Black and minority ethnic communities where only 14% had sought help from their GP for their anxiety (compared to 23% of women). Seeking help is an important step towards accessing support and improving quality of life. Evidence suggests that young people are less likely to seek help from others, particularly professional help from GPs. This was borne out by the young people (18 to 24 years old) in our research who were much more likely to have sought support from their friends (31%) than their GP (27%). When asked if this support had helped, overwhelmingly respondents indicated that the support they accessed had helped them to some extent. Interestingly, support from friends, parents and siblings polled the highest, indicating the importance of social and family support in helping people with their anxiety. Most people had positive experiences of seeking support. Only a few respondents were unhappy with the support they had received. As the vast majority of those who sought support found it helped them, there is a need to encourage those who feel overwhelmed by anxiety to seek support that could help them. Encouragingly, when asked where they would consider going for help or support, health professionals were top of the list. For Jenna, feelings of anxiety were made worse after she was affected by COVID-19. Since falling ill with COVID-19 in 2019, she’s had continuing symptoms along with fibromyalgia. This effect on her health has contributed to feelings of anxiety, as have her experiences of understanding or recognition of long COVID from other people, clinicians and the government. “Day to day, not knowing how you’ll feel when you wake up is exhausting and anxiety-inducing. Horse riding, my husband and the long COVID support group have helped me greatly. I’m pleased to be back on the horse and slow[ly] building up my fitness.” Jenna has benefitted from participating inMHF Wales’s long COVID peer support groupand spoke of the positive effect meeting people with shared experience has had. Read more of Jenna's story This briefing has examined the causes of anxiety and illustrated how anxiety can affect many aspects of people’s lives, including their education and employment, their social life and pressures, and their personal relationships. It can also affect their overall well-being. In our research, we asked all respondents what top three actions would help with their anxiety. Financial security topped the list at 40% (in particular amongst those over 25 years old) peaking at those aged 50 to 64 years old, where nearly two-thirds (63%) think financial security would help. Less pressure at work was more likely to be cited as an action that would help anxiety by men than women (24% vs 18%) and those aged 25 to 34 years old (30%). A mental health emergency should be taken as seriously as a medical emergency. You should seek help if you’re struggling to cope with anxiety, fear or panic; or if things you’re trying yourself are not helping. You can find a range of sources of help on our 'get help' page Anxiety UK was established in 1970 and is run by and for those with anxiety, offering an extensive range of support services designed to help support those affected by anxiety disorders, anxiety and anxiety-based depression.

25,https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/our-work/public-engagement/mental-health-awareness-week/anxiety-report/what-can-governments-and-others-do,What can UK governments and others do to tackle anxiety?,"There are actions people can take to help manage their anxiety on their own, but many of the factors influencing anxiety are beyond an individual’s control. We need to address these wider societal issues and tackle the root causes of poor mental health. We must do more to ensure that mental health is recognised with the same urgency as physical health. There is huge demand for mental health services and people are having to wait for months or years for treatment, as their condition worsens. It’s vital that people can access the right support when they need it. But we also need a much greater focus outside of health services. Action to reduce anxiety and promote good public mental health must be a priority across all government departments. National and local governments along with private businesses and others must work together to create the conditions that reduce the risk of experiencing unhealthy anxiety. For example, employers, schools, colleges, and universities must ensure that these environments - which people interact with on a daily basis - promote and support good mental health. Good mental health should be the benchmark for a thriving society. We need mental health strategies in each of the four nations of the UK that address all the factors which influence mental health at an individual, family, community, and structural level. This would allow for mental health to be considered across a wide range of local policies, services, systems, and datasets that affect the mental health and well-being of individuals and communities. These strategies should be wide-ranging, and include action to create safer neighbourhoods, enforce and where necessary pass legislation prohibiting bullying, harassment, and discrimination (including in the online environment), providing well-resourced adult social care and children’s services, providing income supports to reduce financial stress and housing supports to eliminate housing insecurity, investment in community groups that reduce isolation and increasepeer support, and promoting good mental health by supporting education settings to increase mental health literacy. We cannot hope to reduce rates of anxiety and poor mental health without addressing its root causes, including tackling inequality. The illustration below demonstrates how to deliver strategies and tactics at every level to promote good mental health for all. There is a tendency for governments to focus either on universal campaigns and messages or on targeted interventions for specific at-risk groups. However, both are needed, and they should be adopting a proportionately universal approach. This means ensuring support for everyone, because we all have mental health, but focusing targeted support to address the greater risks that some groups face due to societal inequalities. Such approaches balance universal action for everyone with targeted action, allocating resources according to levels of need and risk for particular social and economic groups to achieve the greatest gains for the resources available. In our survey, young people, single parents, people who are unemployed and people with long-term conditions emerged as high-risk groups who need targeted action. In England, we are profoundly disappointed that the Government has abandoned its planned 10-year mental health and well-being strategy, in favour of a shorter-term Major Conditions Strategy.xxviThis loss of an important opportunity to join up work across government to tackle the social determinants of poor mental health must be rectified by the current and future governments. While it is positive that mental health is included in the Major Conditions Strategy as both a standalone and a cross-cutting theme, it is combining with five other major conditions, so there is a risk it will aim to do too much across too many areas, and will fall short in many of them. It does, however, offer an important opportunity to holistically support people who have both mental health conditions and physical health conditions, such as cancer and heart disease. The government must also ensure that the new Strategy gives mental health - and prevention - equal weight, recognising the increase in demand for mental health support during the pandemic and the pressure that mental health services are under. In Wales, a review of the current Together for Mental Health Plan is beginning. This needs to be completed as a matter of urgency. In Scotland, the preparation of a new 10-year mental health strategy is almost complete and due for publication in June 2023. We expect that this new plan will incorporate cross-department action to prevent poor mental health. In Northern Ireland, a 10-year mental health strategy was published in 2021, and delivery is underway. However, it is currently at risk due to lack of funding. For all jurisdictions, having robust, cross-departmental delivery and monitoring structures alongside designated funding is important. Financial strain and anxietyabout being able to pay essential bills is prevalent across the UK. We urge governments to take action to mitigate the negative impact on people’s mental health. In our survey, 32% of respondents said they had been anxious about being able to pay their bills in the previous two weeks; 40% said that financial security would help prevent anxiety, and this was the highest proportion of any of the solutions offered. Current financial support schemes clearly have not been adequate to prevent financial stress and must be strengthened. We are backing theEssentials Guarantee campaignbeing led by The Joseph Rowntree Foundation and The Trussell Trust, which calls for a level of Universal Credit that provides claimants with enough income for life’s essentials. This is at least £120 per week for a single adult and £200 per week for a couple. Also in our survey, 20% of respondents identifieddebtas the reason for their anxiety, underscoring the need for adequate debt relief schemes. One study found that having an additional-debt account paid off reduces the likelihood of exhibiting anxiety by 11%.xxviiWe are calling for adequate debt relief schemes for those who need it, as set out inour briefing paper on the cost-of-living crisis and mental health. Frontline workers have regular contact with individuals who may be experiencing mental distress due to financial stress. It is important to ensure that this communication is a supportive experience for people and does not stigmatise or cause distress. We are calling for the Government and private sector organisations to ensure all frontline workers in contact with people experiencing financial distress receive relevant training to be able to sensitively respond and signpost to support. This should include frontline workers in health, social care, money and debt advice services, and antipoverty and other community organisations, as well as energy companies, water and telecoms services, and private financial services companies.Our partnerMental Health at Workis an organisation which can provide appropriate training. Efforts should focus on building up people’s assets, rather than only focusing on their needs and problems. Assets are strengths that are identified as valuable to a community or family and can be used to make positive changes to their lives. Assets can be physical resources (land, money, buildings), but, more often in public health, assets tend to be psychosocial, such as self-esteem, confidence, knowledge, skills, social networks, and collective value.xxviiiThere is some evidence that asset-based approaches at the community level can improve mental health outcomes such as self-esteem and social isolation.xxix We all need support to live well. We urge national governments, local authorities, and others to commit to programmes and interventions that promote improved relationships and better mental health at home, at work, in education settings, and in communities. UK Governments should ensure provision at scale of well-evidenced programmes to improve emotional and mental well-being and relationships and help prevent the development of mental health problems, including persistent anxiety. These include cost-effective programmes that can create more positive, supportive cultures in which children, young people and adults are living and working, in the family and in workplaces:xxx Previous: Seeking support for anxiety Download the full report (PDF) xxvi - Written statements - Written questions, answers and statements - UK Parliament.https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/20….xxvii - Ong Q, Theseira W, Ng IYH.

26,https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/our-work/public-engagement/mental-health-awareness-week/stories-about-anxiety/jennas-experience-anxiety,Jenna's experience of anxiety,"Jenna shares her experience of anxiety and how spending time with her horse, Robin, helps her to manage those feelings. Hello, my name is Jenna. I’m currently riding Robin, who is my grand prix dressage horse. Horse riding is in my blood. It’s what I’ve always done from the age of two. Before I was ill, I was competing and riding every day. I had Covid back in 2020. It turned to long Covid and then into Fibromyalgia. My anxiety levels, as you can imagine, were very high. When I first went into hospital, the doctors didn’t know how to treat me. You start to think ‘am I ever going to get out of this?’ The second time I went into the hospital I didn’t think I was coming back out. There were lots of tubes, doctors standing around deciding what type of oxygen to give me or putting me in different positions to try and open up my lungs. It’s quite scary when people we rely on to help don’t know what to do. It makes you feel really anxious. Having horse riding taken away from me, through Covid, long Covid and then the Fibro – it was really hard to get my head around. When the anxiety kicked in that I might have to get rid of the horses, it basically broke me. I just didn’t know what I was going to do. And then I just woke up one day and said, ‘no, I’m not having it. I’m not giving up on something that has been my entire life’. Slowly we’ve made it this far. It still creeps back in and still tries to keep hold, but on my good days I’ll be back on Robin. I found a lack of understanding with people who hadn’t had Covid or suffered with anxiety. They just say, ‘kick on and get on with it’ or ‘you’ll be fine’. It’s only really through talking to peers that has made a massive impact. A couple of us in the group, through talking we found our hair was falling out and it’s little things like that that when you start to think, I’m not alone, they get it’. We’ve got some really weird symptoms – I could always smell fish and chips and other people, they could smell rubbish! It was great to speak to and connect with people who just get it. The biggest thing for me is not letting anxiety eat at you and keep pushing you down. Go out for walks, exercise – whatever you can. For me, it’s riding Robin and just being out. Being in the fresh air has made a massive difference to me. The doctors, the specialists – maybe they don’t have the answers but we’ve got to do what our body will allow. I’ve always made sure I’ve done one thing everyday even if it was just coming up and seeing the horses. This Mental Health Awareness Week, we’re asking people to tell us what works for them.

Hi, I’m Tim. I have PTSD, depression and anxiety, but I don’t let this define me. I use it to empower me. I live in Chesterfield with my best friend and my dog. They both really help me with my anxiety as it can be so disabling at times. I’ve suffered most of my life down to childhood traumas. Anxiety has taken over at times to the point that I didn’t go out and I made unhealthy choices to help me cope. This made things worse so I changed my lifestyle for the better. I still have days where my anxiety takes over but having healthy coping techniques can really help to distract your mind. I sometimes find meeting and speaking to new people triggering. I get palpitations, chest tightening and find it harder to breathe. My mind races with worry and I start thinking of worst case scenarios. I’ve found channelling my anxiety into something creative really helps. One thing I’ve really taken to is photography and editing photos to create art. I’m proud to lead a photography and mental health group at our local community hub. Photography has helped me and I hope those who attend benefit too.  I often use a counting technique to distract my mind – counting using your thumb and finger tips – count one, two, three, four, five and keep repeating and go as fast as you feel comfortable until it starts to feel calm. This distracts your brain, and can be a great tool in a busy environment, as can stepping away and finding a quiet spot for a moment. If you learn about your conditions it can help you understand and enable you process your feelings and emotions. Everyone suffers from anxiety at times – there’s just different levels of this. It’s a natural response to perceive danger. The feelings do pass, if you don’t fight against it but channel it into something positive. I have a disability that affects my mobility. I try not to let this impact upon my passion for photography too much. I’ve found great relief taking photos and photo editing. Looking at the world through a lens can really change your perception of what you see in the world around you. I find beauty in things I was oblivious to and see possible photo opportunities all the time. To help cope with my anxiety, I either grab the camera or pull out my phone, switch the camera on and snap away. Focusing on finding images puts me in a zone of calmness. Have a go, I hope it works for you too. I think it’s really important to remember to rest and take some time out too. Taking time to relax and recover is so important, you can’t pour from an empty cup! Being with the right people can really help. Where we feel safe, we grow. I’m an advocate of peer support. There are people out there who care and are there to help. I run a photography group to help people with their mental health wellbeing. I use my own lived experience in mental health to help others. The community hub I attend has lots of great opportunites to meet people or learn new things. There might be something similar going on where you live. Try to remember there are people out there who care and are there to help. I think speaking to someone who has a similar experience or feelings, or has worn ‘similar shoes’ can be really powerful. There are experts at different charities and in the NHS you can speak to too. The Mental Health Foundation fights for good mental health for all. It’s so important to get behind and support the Foundation so they can continue to break barriers and stigmas around mental health. As part of Mental Health Awareness Week at our Community Hub in Chesterfield we hosted an art exhibition, highlighting the benefits of getting creative on mental health and anxiety. Art and photography has really benefitted me, I want to share this with others and help as many people as people as possible. Hopefully sharing my story will inspire people and give people a new perspective, if my story helps one person, this would mean the world to me.

28,https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/our-work/public-engagement/mental-health-awareness-week/stories-about-anxiety/olympic-medallist-michael-jamiesons-experience-anxiety,Olympic medallist Michael Jamieson's experience of anxiety,"As a supporter of Mental Health Awareness Week, Olympic medallist Michael Jamieson writes about how his own mental health struggles inspired the ethos behind his Swim Academy. The first time I was aware of my own mental health, I was about 19. I had already been living away from home for three years, but I wasn’t yet a funded athlete, and I was putting myself under immense pressure to become a pro swimmer.I’d have really intense periods of highanxietyandstressfollowed by days of really low mood where I didn’t want to be around anyone. However, I didn’t have enough understanding of my mental health, what triggered me, what symptoms I should be aware of or how to manage them. This continued throughout my career as my whole identity was wrapped up in being an athlete. I was determined and completely focused on my performance, constantly pushing to be faster, fitter, stronger. If a training session didn’t go as planned, I’d feel like a failure, and it would really impact my emotions and well-being. After the elation of winning a silver medal at the London 2012 Olympics, I hoped this was the start of my journey but, because of difficulties with my mental health, it was actually the beginning of the end. The pressure I was putting on myself was unsustainable, and it was really taking its toll on my mental health. I couldn’t stay healthy, psychologically, and there was no way I’d be able to perform to my best ability. By the time it came to trials for Rio 2016, I knew that I wasn’t mentally fit enough, but I pushed myself to compete and be beaten so I would have to walk away from competitive sport. I didn’t want to retire as I was only 27 and could have still had several more years at the highest level. While I was struggling with my mental health, the anxiety ahead of big competitions and the severe lows when I thought training wasn’t going well, I didn’t really speak to anyone about how I was feeling or the effect it was having on me. I oscillated between the idea that all pro athletes had the same experiences and there wasn’t any point making a big deal about it to thinking I was all alone and no one else would understand. That’s one of the reasons why I’m keen to support Mental Health Awareness Week. The theme this year is anxiety, something that so many people experience but might not know how to deal with. The Mental Health Foundation is encouraging people to speak out about their experiences of anxiety and the things that help, and they have alsopublished evidence-backed guidance to help people self-manage feelings of anxietyand prevent those feelings from worsening or becoming a more serious mental health problem. I wish I had more self-awareness about my mental health when I was younger and had the tools to manage feelings of anxiety, stress, or low mood in a healthy way. That’s why when developing the programme for my Swim Academy, it was so important that there was a balance between supporting mental health and well-being as well as swimming performance. We have more than 2000 pupils taking swimming classes with us every week across central Scotland. The instructors are trained in Mental Health First Aid, and pupils are rewarded for demonstrating skills in sportsmanship, encouragement, compassion, and well-being in addition to their swimming achievements. We have small classes so the instructors can really get to know the pupils and we create a really supportive and nurturing environment. For me, I’m now in a much better place with my mental health.Exerciseis the number one thing for me for good mental health. If I’m beginning to feel overwhelmed by feelings of anxiety, low mood, or like I’m losing control, I’ll exercise or perhaps do aguided meditationwith an app like Headspace or The Sound Bath. A couple of times a year, I like to get away and travel to a new place – which I also find really good for my mental health. I’ve been to yoga and meditation retreats in amazing places like Guatemala and India. I’m hoping to go to Vietnam this year. What I’ve learned is that it’s so important to talk about how you feel, particularly if you’re struggling.It’s not easy to challenge your thoughts if you’re in a bad place as you don’t want to deal with it, but you have to. You need to build your self-awareness, own your feelings and understand your triggers and what you can do about them. I’d encourage everyone to take part in Mental Health Awareness Week.Get involved in online conversationswith the hashtags #ToHelpMyAnxiety and #MentalHealthAwarenessWeek, and use the Mental Health Foundation'stips on how to manage anxietyorfind further supportif you need it.

29,https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/our-work/public-engagement/mental-health-awareness-week/stories-about-anxiety/husseins-experience-anxiety,Hussein's experience of anxiety,"Freelance transport accessibility consultant Hussein tells us how he’s navigating the cost-of-living crisis and the feelings of anxiety triggered by the uncertainty of the benefits system. The 36-year-old Aberdonian has lived with visual impairment since birth and is registered blind. He relies on benefits, including tax credits and disability allowance, to supplement his freelance income. Hussein is a member of ourDiverse Experiences Advisory Panel (DEAP)which makes recommendations to the Scottish Government on how public policy can help to reduce inequalities and support more people to experience good mental health. Working as a freelancer to provide expert advice to transportation companies about disability access, my monthly income can be unreliable. In the last few years, the pandemic affected the amount of work I was getting and now, with thecost-of-living crisis, it is difficult trying to balance my finances each month. It’s a constant worry. I spend so much time researching the best deals to make sure I can save as much money as possible. At night, I’ll be reading articles which can sometimes offer conflicting advice, causing furtheranxiety. Services to offer advice and support are so busy that it can be impossible to reach them on the phone. The money worries are on my mind all the time – it’s relentless. At the same time, I will often feel guilty if I hear of other’s people situations that are far worse than my own. I receive benefits that top up my income, and while it’s a relief to know that these will be deposited each month, it’s not a stress-free process. Disability allowances are no longer awarded for life, and I will have to undergo assessments again to ensure I still receive it. Meanwhile, the government wants to replace tax credits with universal credit which is a difficult system to work through. The uncertainty of this takes a mental toll as I feel anxiety about the future. Over the winter months, I was doing what I could to keep energy bills down including sleeping in a sleeping bag for additional warmth. It’s particularly difficult as I live with my mum who has health conditions, so I need to make sure she has what she needs to stay well. I’ve been saving what I can and cutting back on things like meeting friends for lunch and Netflix. Other things, like travel by taxi, I can’t give up as it’s necessary for me due to my visual impairment, but the costs are continuing to rise. I am grateful for the assistance from the government and the support offered by community organisations, but there isn’t a very joined-up approach to make sure that people are getting all the help they need. In the meantime, I’ll be continuing to squeeze every penny and do my best to stretch my income to cover my living essentials in the coming months. To help my anxiety and help me relax, I listen to country music or audiobooks as I like getting lost in another world, especially when I can’t sleep at night. I also enjoy acoustic rifle shooting for the blind, a sport I’ve been doing since 1997. I find the mental focus and discipline required for the sport is excellent at casting all my other thoughts and worries to the side.

I’m Huma. I’m 28 years old and from Bradford. I currently support the Mental Health Foundation as a trustee and I’m someone who has experienced mental health problems myself, in particular anxiety. My anxiety started when I was a young child. I have a medical condition which really impacted my mental health growing up. In my daily life I was going to hospitals, having various treatments and things that my friends wouldn’t do. It was a struggle to adapt. It caused a lot of fear, stress and anxiety particularly around dying which is quite common with the condition. I was able to recognise my high anxiety levels as I was just naturally picking at my lips or my fingernails and my breathing would start changing. I would start feeling fear, this impending sort of doom. My gut would just go completely off. I would feel like I was floating, dissociating – almost like I wasn’t on planet earth. The more panic-type symptoms would be hyperventilating and really feeling like I was in immediate danger. I usually needed something firm, like a hug, to bring me back to earth and ground me. Anxiety impacts your relationships and friendships. Growing up I never told my friends. I couldn’t really express how it made me feel. In school, I would leave a classroom to go and have a panic attack away from my friends so they would never ever see the anxiety symptoms. I think it’s really hard to explain this to your friends and family – what it feels like, the pressure-like feeling, the heaviness in your gut and how it makes you physically feel. Now, I noticed that I’m not the only one that struggles with anxiety. It’s really quite common. The more I’ve spoken to other people we can sort of build a connection. We can end up supporting each other. I think in today’s day and age in particular, it’s important to talk about how we’re feeling. There's a lot of ragged stresses and pressures. A lot of people who might not have felt anxious before are feeling anxious now. I think it’s really important to be as open and honest as you can with others, to help each other. I use various techniques, one of them being blinking really rapidly when I’m really anxious. After about 15 seconds, you have to put all your energy into focusing and this helps to stop my brain going into overdrive. It just calms that high pressure and once that’s gone, I can start deep breathing. When I can’t always express how I’m feeling verbally or I don’t want to talk to someone about it, I write notes on my phone, seeing if I can make a rhyme or a song out of it. I write lyrics - creative things to try and express how I feel. One of the things that really helped me was finding a peer support group with other young people.  I learned about my triggers, what I look like when I’m feeling good and what keeps me happy and healthy. Being able to help others is why I got involved with the Mental Health Foundation and now support them with different projects. I always like to remember that things are always changing. Things are always getting better even if we don’t always necessarily feel it at first. Remember that if you are struggling with anxiety, it won’t last forever.

31,https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/articles/supporting-partner-depression,Supporting a partner with depression,"This content mentions depression, which some people may find triggering. Depressioncan cause people to withdraw, behave differently or become more irritable. Common symptoms includeinsomnia, feelings of worthlessness and loss of interest in activities. It can even lead to physical aches and pains. Living with depression for a longer period of time can take a toll on your partner's levels of energy, motivation and passion. It's important not to take changes personally or as a reflection of your partner's investment in the relationship. “Be patient with them and try and go with the flow as much as possible. As hard and weird as that sounds.” Understanding how depression affects your partner can be key to building a healthy, supportive relationship that supports both people’s mental wellbeing. The suggestions below came from our supporters, after we asked about supporting a partner who is depressed. Thank you to everyone who responded. Depression, like many mental health problems, can take over your life. It’s important to remember and remind your partner that the depression diagnosis is only a part of their identity. They also have many other roles and interests. Being able to fulfil these roles is a big part of recovery. We know that exercise and staying active can protect our mental health. You may like to suggest going for a walk or visiting your favourite places. Keep trying but don’t push too much if they aren’t ready to join you. You may notice gradual changes in their mood, rather than a massive improvement from one moment to the next. “Be understanding and listen.” Watching a loved one go through a difficult time may leave you searching for the perfect solution. Practical advice and tips can help, but sometimes rather than trying to 'fix a problem', it's better to listen to your partner. Be a safe place for them to turn to. Don’t dismiss their feelings. Offer hope and remind them of better days and that it’s likely that things will improve again. “Try not to take to heart the negativity around you and make sure you get to have a break.” Being the main source of support for a partner living with depression can add a lot of pressure on you. It's important to look after yourself and ask for support when you need it. Opening up conversations to your friends and families and getting them involved usually makes a big difference in tackling the stigma and building a circle of support for both of you. Good communication with your partner is very important – remember that your needs and opinions should be met and respected too. “Get educated and encourage professional help.” Gaining knowledge will help you guide your partner through their depression, but gently encouraging them to seek out professional help does not mean you have failed. Rather, understand that your partner may need care that you don’t have the tools to provide. “Let them know that you love them no less because of it.” Living with depression can be exhausting and isolating. It helps to know that someone cares for and supports you, no matter what. If you feel affected by the content you have read, please see ourget helppage for support. 24th Oct 2025

The easing of lockdown seems to have helped many British teenagers’ mental health. Still, loneliness and anxiety remain extremely common, according to new research by the Mental Health Foundation and Swansea University. The study, launched in the summer of 2020, is one of the few that repeatedly asks younger teenagers about their experiences of the pandemic. The latest results were gathered from 2349 British teenagers (aged 13 to 19) in an online survey by YouGov between 24 May to 15 June 2021. “We’re seeing hopeful signs of young people’s resilience in our latest data but also evidence that many teenagers have a mental health ‘hangover’from the pandemic,” saidCatherine Seymour, Head of Research at the Mental Health Foundation. “We gathered our new results in late May and June when young people were back in school, restrictions were lifting, and vaccines were being rolled out. “We found that fewer teenagers said their mental health is ‘poor’, compared to when we last surveyed them in March, while pessimism about the future has become less common and fewer teenagers are reporting experiences associated with depression,” she added. The proportion of teenagers who say their mental health is ‘poor’ has fallen from 18% of those surveyed in March to 14% of those questioned in the new survey. Pessimism is also becoming less common, although it is widespread. When the study previously asked teenagers about the future for people their age, 65% said it would be ‘a lot’ or ‘a little’ worse. This has fallen to 57% of teenagers questioned in the latest survey. Further results suggest that fewer teenagers are having experiences associated withdepression, including problems withsleeping,appetite, concentrating and feeling bad about themselves. Catherine Seymour added: “While all this is encouraging, our results also show that loneliness is widespread, despite the unlocking, while huge numbers remainanxiousabout the pandemic.Lonelinessis especially significant because it suggests alack of nourishing relationshipsthat help teenagers to cope with difficult times. Loneliness leaves them more vulnerable.” Loneliness appears to be as common as it was in March 2021. According to the latest results, 64% of teenagers surveyed said they ‘sometimes’ or ‘often’ have no one to talk to, and 66% said they ‘sometimes’ or ‘often’ feel alone. Anxiety also remains common. 43% of those surveyed said they are ‘very’ or ‘fairly’ worried about another lockdown, 45% are ‘very’ or ‘fairly’ worried about their family or friends being ill with COVID-19 and 32% ‘very’ or ‘fairly’ worried about someone close to them dying. Almost one-in-four (39%) said they are ‘very’ or ‘fairly’ worried about the pandemic affecting their mental health. Anxiety and other distress are especially common among some groups, including females, teenagers whose parents are classed as ‘C2DE’, full-time students, people with long-term health conditions and disabilities and 18- to 19-year-olds. Professor Ann John of Swansea Universitysaid:“The big influences on teenagers’ mental health are living in economic adversity and having pre-existing mental and physical health conditions and disabilities. And, specifically, that time in late teens of rapid social and emotional changes and life transitions. Teenagers in these groups appear to be less likely to bounce back from the effects of the pandemic. “Looking forward, we really need to ensure that these inequalities are not widened and that the pandemic does not have a knock-on, long-lasting effects on their futures. To do this, we need policies and practical initiatives that span government departments and go beyond mental health services–although these are vital and chronically underfunded–to include accessible and accessed employment, training and education opportunities, financial safety nets for families and affordable housing.” The study is supported by MQ Mental Health Research, which recently led to calls for the Government to do more to support the mental health of children and young people during the pandemic. Lea Milligan, the charity’s Chief Executive, said: “The historic underfunding of mental health services, resources and research for young people has been brought into sharp focus by the pandemic. Now that we are, I hope, starting to emerge from the shadow of COVID-19, we can focus on levelling up and supporting the most vulnerable to recover through a holistic approach to mental health. “The improvements to wellbeing that young people are self-reporting through this survey are a welcome first step to recovery. If we are to ensure the future health of the COVID-19 generation truly, then much more needs to be done.” All figures, unless otherwise stated, are from YouGov Plc. The total sample size was 2349 teenagers aged 13 to 19 years. Fieldwork was undertaken between 24 May – 15 June 2021. The survey was carried out online. The figures have been weighted and represent all British Teenagers aged 13 to 19 years. With funding from MQ, the Mental Health Foundation and Swansea University are leading this longitudinal study of adolescents (people aged 13 to 19) across Great Britain. It is part of a wider study of how the pandemic affects people’s mental health in the UK by the Mental Health Foundation and the University of Cambridge, Swansea University, Strathclyde University, Queen’s University Belfast and De Montfort University Leicester. The study uses repeated cross-sectional surveys via YouGov. Survey participants are different on each sampling occasion but taken from the same pool and always representative of the British population. The survey covers approximately 20 topics, including the pandemic’s impact on mental health and the key drivers of risk. Ethical approval has been obtained from Swansea University’s Research Ethics Committee. MQ Mental Health Researchis the biggest charity that exclusively funds research into mental health conditions, their causes and treatments. The Adolescent Data Platform facilitated by MQ aims to improve the speed and effectiveness of research into young people's mental health. It brings together data from different sources and is the biggest platform of its kind. It helps to connect researchers from different fields, reduce the cost and time involved in accessing information and address the significant gap in research about young people's mental health. Our vision is for good mental health for all. We work to prevent mental health problems. We will drive change towards a mentally healthy society for all and support communities, families and individuals to lead mentally healthy lives with a particular focus on those at greatest risk. We are the home of Mental Health Awareness Weekand has developed a dedicated COVID-19 resources hub that includes advice aimed at young people. It has also published recommendations about what government policies will help people in the UK to recover from the pandemic. The charity is to invest at least £1 million in programmes targeting some of the groups who have been hardest hit by the pandemic – including people of colour, single parents and those with long-term health conditions. 26th Jun 2025

There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. Worryingly high numbers of people in the LGBTQIA+ community have experienced body-image anxiety, a new online survey from the Mental Health Foundation has revealed. Of all the groups surveyed in the UK, the lesbian, gay and bisexual community appears to be the one most likely to be affected in this way. One third (33%) of the LGBTQIA+ community said they had experiencedsuicidal thoughtsand feelings in relation to theirbody image. Nearly four in ten (39%) of people who identified as bisexual and almost a quarter (23%) of people who identified as gay or lesbian have experienced suicidal thoughts and feelings because of concerns about their body image. This compares to around one in ten (11%) of heterosexuals. Almost half (45%) of people who identified as bisexual and nearly three in ten (29%) people who identified as gay or lesbian have felt “disgusted” because of their body image over the last year. The survey was commissioned to markMental Health Awareness Weekfrom 13 to 19 May, which this year has the theme of body image. Other survey findings show that 29% of bisexuals surveyed have deliberately hurt themselves because of their body image, as have 15% of gay men and lesbians. 59% of bisexuals and 46% of gay men or lesbiansfelt “anxious”because of their body image. 66% of bisexuals havefelt “depressed”because of their body image, as have 45% of gay men and lesbians. Research has found that gay men are more likely than their heterosexual counterparts to experience a desire to be thin, and this can sometimes manifest itself in higher levels of eating disorder symptoms. Studies focused on gay and bisexual men have found a connection between higher levels of body dissatisfaction, and increased likelihood of experiencing depressive symptoms and increased sexual anxiety and poorer sexual performance. Toni Giugliano, Policy and Public Affairs Manager at the Mental Health Foundationsaid: “Millions of adults across the UK are struggling with concerns about their body image, but of all the groups surveyed, the LGBTQIA+ community is most likely to be affected. Large numbers of LGBTQIA+ people have said they have self-harmed or had suicidal thoughts and feelings or have felt anxious or depressed about their bodies. “Research has shown that sexual minority men feel under pressure to hold an appearance that is centred on looking slim and athletic. Pressures to live up to those ideals can have a negative impact on their emotional health. “We found that many people identified social media as a key influence that caused them to worry about their body image. The main picture from our survey was one in which commercial, social media and advertising pressures on body image are contributing to mental health problems for millions of people. “This social harm has been allowed to develop largely unchecked. While there have been some positive initiatives, social media companies have frequently been unwilling to take the necessary steps to protect their users from harmful content. “That is why one of our key asks is for the UK Government to make preventing the promotion of unhealthy or idealised body image images a specific part of its forthcoming regulation strategy.” The Foundation states that new codes of practice should include an expectation that social media companies must take practical steps to ensure that the content they promote does note exacerbate body image concerns. The Foundation has also published an accompanying reportBody Image: How we think and feel about our bodieswhich gives advice and tips on how people can take individual action to address this urgent problem.

There are no specific trans figures available because the number who identified as trans for the survey were too low to give a representative sample. However, this is an area the Mental Health Foundation is keen to explore and we intend to do further research on trans people and body image. The total sample size was 4,505 adults, including 179 gay men or lesbians and 190 bisexuals. Fieldwork was between 25 to 26 March 2019. The survey was carried out online. The figures have been weighted and are representative of all UK adults (aged 18+). Since 1949, the Mental Health Foundation has been the UK’s leading charity for everyone’s mental health prevention at the heart of what we do, we aim to find and address the sources of mental health problems so that people and communities can thrive. Our mission is to help people understand, protect and sustain their mental health. Mental health problems such as depression, self-harm, alcohol and drug abuse and suicidal thoughts can affect anyone, but they’re more common among people who are LGBTIQ+. While people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) experience body image concerns in ways that are generally similar to people who identify as heterosexual, their experience and relationship with their body is likely to differ in specific ways. 11th Dec 2023

Please read with care. There are details of where to find help at the bottom of this page. The Mental Health Foundation has warned thatlonelinessis creating mental health problems among tens of thousands of young people across Scotland. Our new research has found that more than half of 18 to 24-year-olds experiencedepressionwhen they feel lonely, with 42% saying it leads to anxiety. 67% say their mental health worsens as a result of feeling lonely. While loneliness among older adults is well documented, the problem among younger generations is often underreported. With 2018 being Scotland's 'Year of Young People', the Foundation is warning that too many young adults are struggling with mental health problems and that a mental health storm is imminent unless we place mental health at the heart of the school curriculum. Our new research shows that technology, includingsocial media, could be exacerbating social isolation. 82% of young people say that spending time face to face with others improves their mental health. In contrast, 30% say that technology, such as social media, is causing them to feel lonely as it has replaced face-to-face contact. The stigma of loneliness remains the greatest barrier to seeking help as 46% say they would be too embarrassed to talk about it and 52% feel they ought to cope with the problem themselves. Around 30% wouldn’tspeak to their GPor another health professional about it suggesting that tens of thousands of young people could be living with undiagnosed mental health problems. Loneliness can contribute tostress,anxiety,depression, paranoia and cognitive decline, and it is a well-known factor insuicide. It can be both a cause and effect of mental health problems. The Foundation welcomes the Scottish Government's commitment to establish a Youth Commission on mental health and welcomes its plans to publish a national strategy on tackling social isolation in the lifetime of this parliament. Isabella Goldie, Director at the Mental Health Foundation, said: ""Loneliness among younger people is hugely underreported, but our research is clear that social isolation affects the mental health of young people more than any other age group. Our children are finding life harder to navigate than previous generations, and worryingly, they are living with high levels of distress. This is something we can no longer choose to ignore. ""Relationships and social connections remain at the heart of what makes and breaks our mental health. A child's ability to communicate and form relationships is vital right from the point that they enter the education system if they are to thrive at school - and “school readiness” is one of the strongest predictors of whether a child will go on to develop mental health problems. ""We need to acknowledge the important role that both parents and teachers play in helping young people to develop good relationship-building skills and do more to support adults under stress, ensuring that they are equipped to support our young people and that their own stress doesn’t leak onto those in their charge. This is vital as parental mental health has a direct impact on young people's mental health. ""If the Scottish Government is serious about making 2018 the Year of Young People then it must place health and wellbeing at the heart of the school curriculum - not at the sidelines as it currently is. It needs to invest in school-based counselling and give teachers the training they need to create inclusive environments and explore mental health. Too many of our young people are not thriving, and unless we act now, we will face an imminent mental health storm."" The research was conducted by YouGov and based in Scotland.

The UK population is experiencing widespread levels ofstress,anxietyand hopelessness in response to financial concerns, according to a new survey commissioned by the Mental Health Foundation. Ahead of the Chancellor’s autumn statement, the Foundation warns that action needs to be taken to prevent a significant rise in mental health problems across the UK, as large numbers of people report feeling anxious, hopeless or stressed due to their financial circumstances. The survey of 3000 adults aged 18 and over, conducted by Opinium between 7 to 14 November 2022, found that 29% of adults experienced stress, 34% experienced anxiety and 10% said they felt hopeless because of financial worries during the previous month. When thinking about the next few months, UK adults are most concerned about not being able to maintain their standard of living (71%), heat their home (66%) or pay general monthly household bills (61%). Significantly, half (50%) of UK adults were at least a little worried about being able to afford food over the next few months, rising to 67% of younger adults aged 18 to 34. The Foundation is calling on the UK Government to ensure people across the UK will be protected from the negative impact of both the cost-of-living crisis and potential cuts to public services. This includes protecting financial benefits, so they rise with inflation and increasing the capacity of debt services, food banks, community organisations and social security departments. It also includes training staff on addressing thetraumamany claimants have experienced. Evidence has repeatedly shown that financial strain andpovertyare key contributors to mental health problems. The Foundation warns that the number of people experiencing poor mental health will likely increase rapidly as more people struggle to make ends meet. Mark Rowland, Chief Executive of Mental Health Foundation, said: Our findings are a warning sign of the mental health consequences of the cost-of-living crisis. We must protect public services and benefits at this crucial time. If people are struggling to meet their essential needs for a warm home and enough healthy food for their families, we can expect a significant rise in mental health problems as the burden of financial strain continues to take its toll. The challenge the country faces cannot be easily addressed. However, there are steps we can take to protect people’s mental health at this time. We must support those at higher risk by, for example, raising benefits in line with inflation and employers committing to pay their staff the real living wage. Training frontline staff in social security and debt services on how to recognise and respond sensitively to the trauma experienced by many people they are working with can also help. Preventing mental health problems is vital. Our mental health services are already stretched beyond capacity; we cannot sit on the sidelines and watch them collapse under ever-greater demand. The UK Government should consider the mental health impact of all decisions that affect the cost-of-living crisis. Other measures we ask for include maintaining and extending free or subsidised public transport to allow people to connect with friends and family and increasing the provision of debt advice and other vital community services."" Earlier this year, the Foundationpublished research with the London School of Economics and Political Science, which put the cost of mental health problems to the UK economy at £117 billion annually.

38,https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/about-us/news/new-research-college-students-scotland-report-depression,Students in Scotland report significant symptoms of depression,"Location:Scotland The largest study on the mental health and well-being of college students in Scotland has revealed more than one-third (37%) experienced food insecurity in the previous 12 months, according to the report published by the Mental Health Foundation today. More than 2000 students from colleges across Scotland participated in the Thriving Learners study* which also found that more than half of the students surveyed (54%) reported having moderate, moderately severe or severe symptoms ofdepression. Among students who have experienced food insecurity, a quarter (25%) had severe symptoms of depression. Despite the prevalence of mental health problems among the college student population, more than half (55%) said they have concealed a mental health problem due to fear ofstigmatisation. The study is led by the Foundation in partnership with Colleges Scotland and funded by The Robertson Trust. Surveys and qualitative research were undertaken between February and May 2022, before the harshest impacts of thecost of living crisiswere taking hold. Yet, at this time one in six students (17%) lived in a household that had run out of food in the past 12 months. These findings and others shared within the report have prompted a series of recommendations from the Foundation and Colleges Scotland, including calls for sustained Scottish Government investment in mental health and well-being support at college. College support services are also encouraged to enhance communications to students, particularly those at higher risk of poor mental health, about mental health and well-being supports available. To help address studentpoverty, the report recommends annual data collection by the Scottish Government and Scottish Funding Council to better understand the scale of the problem and find solutions. Without strong data on college student poverty, it is challenging for colleges to take the right mitigating steps against the context of reducing funding for the college sector and pressures on the National Health Service. Julie Cameron, Associate Director at the Mental Health Foundation in Scotland, said:“The findings of our Thriving Learners study are alarming. Far from thriving, a high number of students are struggling to pay for food and have poor mental health, including severe symptoms of depression. “The links between financial strain, food insecurity and poor mental health are undeniable. We are failing our college students (who are primarily young people) if we do not ensure that they all have access to the right support for good physical and mental health. “We know colleges are under a lot of pressure following the budget cuts of recent years. We need the Scottish Government to commit to increased investment and sustained funding for mental health and well-being support for our quarter of a million college students across Scotland. As well as mental health counselling services in colleges, this investment should feature a wide range of measures to support healthy well-being andprevent mental health problemsfrom developing, such as working with student associations to deliver peer support for students. Several colleges have run breakfast and lunch clubs to ensure students are getting a nutritious meal during the cost of living crisis, we need to be able to offer this in all colleges in Scotland.” Students with increased vulnerabilities - including those who are care-experienced, estranged, have unpaid caregiving responsibilities, live with a long-term health condition or identify as other gender - had poorer mental health and well-being outcomes across every metric. The report highlights the need for any support made available to college students to have an increased focus on these groups. Jon Vincent, Principal of Glasgow Clyde College and Lead Principal for Mental Health, said:“This research is very stark. To see that so many college students are struggling with their mental health is very worrying, especially when safeguarding the well-being of our students is part of the core responsibility of a college. “While the data is a cause for concern, it does provide us with a much clearer picture of the scale of the challenges students and their families face and allows us to advocate more effectively on their behalf. “I know some of our students have very real struggles with their mental health andanxietywhich is of course under more pressure because of the cost of living crisis. But helping students to succeed is why we are here, and I strongly encourage any students needing help to seek support from their college who will be well equipped to do so.” DonnaMarie Steel, Programmes and Practice Officer at The Robertson Trust, said:""Through our in-house scholarship programme, we have seen first-hand how barriers to engaging in Further or Higher Education can impact a student's emotional well-being. “This has been clearly highlighted by the study's findings and we are pleased to have been able to contribute to this much-needed resource for the sector. We look forward to following the progress of the Mental Health Foundation’s recommendations.” *The Thriving Learners survey was live from 24 February to 23 May 2022 and had a total sample size of 2086 college students in Scotland.

Among the recommendations is a call for the development and delivery of mental health strategies in each UK nation that include a focus on prevention and responsibilities across all government departments. Polling of 6000 UK adults (conducted on our behalf by Opinium) found that nearly three-quarters of the population (73%) had felt anxious at least sometimes in the previous two weeks, while more than a quarter (26%) of those with feelings of anxiety felt anxious to the extent that it stopped them from doing what they’d like or need to do. One in five people (20%) felt anxious most or all of the time. Despite anxiety being so common, stigma and shame play a part in how people deal with anxiety, with almost half (45%) of UK adults with feelings of anxiety keep it a secret. This suggests that although there has been progress in discussing mental health more openly in recent years, significant numbers of people are still not comfortable talking about their own experiences. The extent of the problem is compounded by one in three people (30%) with feelings of anxiety saying they are not coping well with those feelings. This is worrying because chronic (or long-term) anxiety is associated with a higher risk of physical or mental health problems. The results of the polling make it clear that financial stress is giving rise to anxiety across the UK as existing support for people who are struggling does not go far enough. The most commonly reported cause of anxiety in the past two weeks was being able to afford to pay bills, reported by 32% of respondents, while 40% of respondents said that financial security would help prevent anxiety.

A big focus of our Mental Health Awareness Week is to encourage people to share their experiences on anxiety and increase understanding of the steps we can take. However, the scale of the problems requires change that goes beyond individual action. “We need governments across the UK to recognise and be honest about their roles in the causes of and solutions to high levels of anxiety. “We can’t treat our way out of a mental health crisis; we need action which tackles the root causes of poor mental health including poverty, financial strain, bullying and discrimination. We need our governments to develop and deliver long-term mental health plans with a focus on prevention of poor mental health, including anxiety. They must ensure that all government departments from work and pensions to justice, transport to education, have a responsibility to ensure their policy decisions support good public mental health.” In the paper published today, we are calling for the UK and devolved governments to publish and deliver long-term plans to prevent mental ill-health.

More than one in five people (23%) felt anxious most or all of the time. Despite anxiety being so common, stigma and shame play a part in how people deal with anxiety. More than four in ten adults in Wales (45%) with feelings of anxiety keep it a secret. This suggests that although there has been progress in discussing mental health more openly in recent years, significant numbers of people are still not comfortable talking about their own experiences. Worryingly, one in three people (31%) with feelings of anxiety say they are not coping well with those feelings. This is worrying because chronic (or long-term) anxiety is associated with a higher risk of physical or mental health problems. The results of the polling make it clear that financial stress is giving rise to anxiety across Wales, showing that existing support for people who are struggling does not go far enough. The most commonly reported cause of anxiety in the past two weeks was being able to afford to pay bills, reported by more than one-third (36%) of respondents, while 44% said that financial security would help prevent anxiety. We have also released evidence-based advice on how to reduce anxiety’s toll Dr Shari McDaid, Head of Policy for devolved nations at Mental Health Foundation, said: “Across Wales people are experiencing levels of anxiety that is stopping them from living their lives, with many not speaking out and struggling to cope. More can and must be done to protect our mental health. A big focus of our Mental Health Awareness Week is to encourage people to share their experiences on anxiety and increase understanding of the steps we can take. However, the scale of the problems requires change that goes beyond individual action. “We can’t treat our way out of a mental health crisis; we need action which tackles the root causes of poor mental health including poverty, financial strain, and inequality. We urge the Welsh Government to follow through on their promise to publish this year a cross-departmental mental health strategy for the next 10 years with strong action to reduce mental health inequalities.” In the paper published today, we are calling for the Welsh government to publish and deliver a long-term plan to prevent mental ill-health. These plans should include action and accountability across government departments. That’s because all aspects of our society, including work, education and housing, impact on our mental health. We are calling for urgent action from both the Welsh and UK governments to alleviate the pressures of the risingcost-of-livingas part of these preventative, cross-government plans. This must include ensuring social security benefits cover life’s essentials so people are not forced to skip meals or forgo heating their homes and debt-relief programmes. We hope thatour Mental Health Awareness Week campaigncan give people an opportunity to speak out about how anxiety affects them, share their experiences, get tips and advice for how to manage feelings of anxiety and find out about what further support is available.

Ar ddiwrnod cyntaf Wythnos Ymwybyddiaeth Iechyd Meddwl (15-21 Mai 2023), mae’r elusen y tu ôl i’r ymgyrch yn codi’r pryder ynghylch effaith gorbryder ledled Cymru wrth iddi gyhoeddi Cyfnod Ansicr: Gorbryder yng Nghymru a sut i fynd i’r afael ag ef. Mae’r papur yn amlinellu pa mor gyffredin yw gorbryder ar draws y boblogaeth, y prif ffactorau sbarduno yn dilyn y pandemig a’r argyfwng costau byw, ac argymhellion i lywodraethau leihau lefelau gorbryder a chefnogi iechyd meddwl da. Ymysg yr argymhellion mae galwad am ddatblygu a chyflwyno strategaeth iechyd meddwl 10 mlynedd yng Nghymru sy’n cynnwys ffocws ar atal a gweithredu ar draws holl adrannau’r llywodraeth. Canfu arolwg o 1000 o oedolion yng Nghymru a gynhaliwyd ar ran y Sefydliad Iechyd Meddwl gan Opinium fod bron i dri chwarter (73%) wedi teimlo’n orbryderus o leiaf weithiau yn ystod y pythefnos blaenorol. Roedd dros chwarter (26%) o’r rheini a oedd yn teimlo gorbryder yn teimlo’n orbryderus i’r graddau ei fod wedi’u hatal rhag gwneud yr hyn y byddent yn hoffi neu angen ei wneud. Roedd mwy nag un o bob pump (23%) yn teimlo’n orbryderus y rhan fwyaf o’r amser neu drwy’r amser. Er bod gorbryder mor gyffredin, mae stigma a chywilydd yn chwarae rhan yn y ffordd y mae pobl yn delio â gorbryder. Mae dros bedwar oedolyn o bob deg yng Nghymru (45%) sydd â theimladau o orbryder yn ei gadw’n gyfrinach. Mae hyn yn awgrymu, er bod cynnydd wedi bod o ran trafod iechyd meddwl yn fwy agored dros y blynyddoedd diwethaf, nad yw nifer sylweddol o bobl yn gyfforddus yn siarad am eu profiadau eu hunain o hyd. Yn bryderus, mae un o bob tri pherson (31%) sydd â theimladau o orbryder yn dweud nad ydynt yn ymdopi’n dda â’r teimladau hynny. Mae hyn yn peri pryder oherwydd bod gorbryder cronig (neu hirdymor) yn gysylltiedig â risg uwch o broblemau iechyd corfforol neu iechyd meddwl. Mae canlyniadau’r arolwg yn ei gwneud yn glir bod straen ariannol yn achosi gorbryder ledled Cymru, gan ddangos nad yw’r gefnogaeth bresennol i bobl sy’n cael trafferthion yn mynd yn ddigon pell. Y rheswm mwyaf cyffredin a nodwyd dros orbryder yn ystod y pythefnos diwethaf oedd gallu fforddio talu biliau, a nodwyd gan fwy na thraean (36%) o’r ymatebwyr, a dywedodd 44 y cant y byddai diogelwch ariannol yn helpu i atal gorbryder. Dywedodd Dr Shari McDaid, Pennaeth Polisi ar gyfer y gwledydd datganoledig yn y Sefydliad Iechyd Meddwl: “Ar draws Cymru, mae pobl yn profi lefelau o orbryder sy’n eu hatal rhag byw eu bywydau, gyda llawer yn peidio â siarad amdano ac yn cael trafferth ymdopi. Mae modd ac mae’n rhaid gwneud mwy i ddiogelu ein hiechyd meddwl. Un o brif elfennau ein Hwythnos Ymwybyddiaeth Iechyd Meddwl yw annog pobl i rannu eu profiadau o orbryder a gwella dealltwriaeth o’r camau y gallwn eu cymryd. Fodd bynnag, mae maint y problemau yn gofyn am newid sy’n mynd y tu hwnt i gamau gweithredu unigol. “Ni allwn ni drin ein ffordd allan o argyfwng iechyd meddwl; mae arnom angen gweithredu sy’n mynd i’r afael ag achosion sylfaenol iechyd meddwl gwael gan gynnwys tlodi, straen ariannol ac anghydraddoldeb. Rydym yn annog Llywodraeth Cymru i fwrw ymlaen â’i haddewid i gyhoeddi strategaeth iechyd meddwl drawsadrannol ar gyfer y 10 mlynedd nesaf eleni, gyda chamau cadarn i leihau anghydraddoldebau iechyd meddwl.” Yn y papur a gyhoeddwyd heddiw, mae’r Sefydliad Iechyd Meddwl yn galw ar Lywodraeth Cymru i gyhoeddi a chyflawni cynllun hirdymor i atal salwch meddwl. Dylai’r cynllun hwn gynnwys camau gweithredu ac atebolrwydd ar draws adrannau’r llywodraeth. Y rheswm am hynny yw bod pob agwedd ar ein cymdeithas, gan gynnwys gwaith, addysg a thai, yn effeithio ar ein hiechyd meddwl. Mae’r elusen yn galw am weithredu brys gan Lywodraeth Cymru a Llywodraeth y DU i liniaru pwysau’r cynnydd mewn costau byw fel rhan o’r cynlluniau trawslywodraethol hyn. Rhaid i hyn gynnwys sicrhau bod budd-daliadau nawdd cymdeithasol yn cynnwys hanfodion bywyd, fel nad yw pobl yn cael eu gorfodi i beidio â chael prydau bwyd neu beidio â chynhesu eu cartref, a rhaglenni lleihau dyledion. Mae’r Sefydliad Iechyd Meddwl yn gobeithio y gall ei Ymgyrch Wythnos Ymwybyddiaeth Iechyd Meddwl roi cyfle i bobl ddweud sut mae gorbryder yn effeithio arnyn nhw, rhannu eu profiadau, cael awgrymiadau a chyngor ar sut i reoli teimladau o orbryder, a chael gwybod pa gymorth pellach sydd ar gael.

43,https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/about-us/news/financial-strain-driving-uks-anxiety,Financial strain is driving the UK’s anxiety,"Anxiety is the Mental Health Foundation’s theme for Mental Health Awareness Week(15 to 21 May 2023), and with theMoney and Mental Health Policy Institute, we are calling for the government to take action to protect people’s mental health. Data we released earlier this weekshowsanxietyis widespread across the UK as living costs continue to rise. Almost three-quarters of the population (73%) had felt anxious at least sometimes in the last two weeks. One in three people (32%) said worries about ‘being able to afford to pay my bills’ made them anxious in the last two weeks. 20% said ‘debt’ and 15% cited job insecurity or unemployment. More than one-third of UK adults (37%) with anxiety said that they are ashamed to talk to anyone about it. Young people are the most likely to avoid opening up about anxiety. More than half of those aged 18 to 24 (56%) said that they wouldn’t tell their employer about anxiety. Mark Rowland, Chief Executive of the Mental Health Foundation said: “There are clear links between financial strain and poor mental health and for people experiencing both they are faced with a double taboo. We don’t like to talk about money matters and the perceived stigma about mental health is stopping many of us from talking about our problems. “The cost-of-living crisis has exacerbated both financial strain and poor mental health, creating a public mental health emergency. “We were hugely disappointed that just as financial pressures on people across the UK increased, causing anxiety about being able to pay the bills, the Government abandoned its planned 10-year mental health and wellbeing strategy for England, replacing it with a shorter-term Major Conditions Strategy that will cover mental health alongside several physical health conditions. “We need the Government to take concrete steps to address the mental health impacts of the cost-of-living crisis with financial support schemes that alleviate financial stress. In addition, front-line workers such as debt advice services, energy companies and banks should be supported to respond effectively to the mental health effects of financial strain.” Research from the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute shows how few people with mental health problems disclose a mental health problem to an essential services provider. Only 14% have disclosed to their financial services firm, 12% to their energy firm, 13% to their telecoms provider and 11% to their water provider. Helen Undy, Chief Executive of the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute said: “It's no surprise to see that the cost of living crisis has become a serious source of anxiety for many people across the UK, who are starting each day worried about how they’ll make their finances stretch. Talking about your mental health can be daunting at the best of times, but money problems can seriously compound those difficulties and can add another layer of shame that makes it harder to deal with. “We need the government and regulators to step up support measures to reduce the financial pressures and distress that people are facing. That includes stopping debt collectors from hounding people about missed payments and making sure that people can get the support they need through the benefits system. “Businesses like banks, energy providers and other utility firms can play a critical role in easing the anxiety people are facing during the cost-of-living crisis too. Taking steps to make sure their staff are trained to help customers who disclose they are struggling with their mental health and to signpost them to support, could make a big difference.” Learn more about the week and read our report about anxiety in the UK.

44,https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/about-us/news/single-parents-are-more-risk-anxiety,Single parents are more at risk of anxiety,"Four in tensingle parentsin the UK with anxiety (41%) feelanxiousto the extent that it stops them from doing what they like or need to do, most or all of the time. Just 26% of the general population with anxiety said it affected their life in the same way, showing that single parents are significantly more likely to experience debilitating anxiety. Single parents are more likely to feel anxious than others. Almost nine in ten single parents (89%) felt anxious in the last two weeks, compared to 73% of the general population. Of those single parents who had experienced anxiety in the last two weeks, 86% found it had interfered with their day-to-day life. Julie Cameron, Associate Director at Mental Health Foundation,said: “Parenting is a challenge and for people who are raising a child on their own, the pressure can be immense. Worry and anxiety can intensify when you are solely responsible for looking after your child, paying the bills, and providing everything a child needs. “It can also be a lonely experience and our survey showed that almost one-third of single parents felt anxiety due to loneliness (31%). This is compared to 23% of the general population. That’s why it’s important that single parents have support networks, people they can talk to who understand what they’re going through. It’s vital governments and local authorities commit to investing in community programmes and groups that support people at higher risk of poor mental health, including single parents.” Thecost-of-living crisishas impacted the experience of anxiety for single parents with more than a third of single parents (39%) saying that debt had made them feel anxious in the last two weeks, similar numbers (36%) felt anxious about being able to pay the bills. 20% of single parents said that worrying about their housing situation made them feel anxious in the last two weeks. When asked what would help with their anxiety, 41% of anxious single parents said financial security and a quarter (24%) said help with debt. Small Talk is our project that supports partner organisations which support lone parents in Scotland to develop and deliver peer support groups. The project was developed following a study which clearly identified the need for support during the perinatal period - birth to 12 months, and early mental health and well-being support for lone parents, including during pregnancy. It also highlighted the benefit of peer support networks for the emotional well-being of lone parents and their desire for more support of that type. A group of 11 parents who have participated in peer support groups have co-produced a two-part film series about their experience of parenting alone, anxiety, and the value of support groups through pregnancy and the early years (or perinatal period) of childhood. One film is a dramatisation of their experiences, and one is a documentary. Learn more about our Small Talk programme Chloe, age 20 from Wishaw, is a single mum to a 9-month-old boy.She is supported by One Parent Families Scotland and attends their Best Beginnings parent and child sessions in North Lanarkshire. Chloe said: “It took me a lot to open up about my mental health. I felt embarrassed and I felt like a bad parent. I didn’t know you could get as low as I could. At the start, I felt no emotion but to look at it now, I’m proud of myself. Speaking about it has made it a lot better. When I spoke about it, it made sense...I’m glad I got the help. “The group gave me a break and my own time. It’s always just me and him. I’m a supermum and I never thought I could be a single mum. It’s the best job ever.” Learn more about the week and read our report about anxiety in the UK. Ends For further information and interview requests, pleasepress@mentalhealth.org.uk.
